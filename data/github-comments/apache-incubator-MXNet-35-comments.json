I use numpy to test and the result is that only 4 cpu cores is up to 100%. If I can make all the cpu up to 100%, mxnet probably can be faster. \nBut correspondingly, caffe which use the same openblas in the same machine can also be faster. The speed gap between caffe and mxnet is still significant.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167064497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167064783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1053#issuecomment-167064783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1053","id":167064783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzA2NDc4Mw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T08:03:48Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T08:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I didn't write the code but you can verify by either 1) check the gradient with gradient checker in test/python/unittests/check_utils.py or 2) compare it with CuDNNBatchNorm\n@antinucleon \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167064783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167065364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1031#issuecomment-167065364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1031","id":167065364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzA2NTM2NA==","user":{"login":"antinucleon","id":1258974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1258974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon","html_url":"https://github.com/antinucleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T08:08:49Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T08:08:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for letting us know.

we implemented what caffe's alexnet required, you can\n1. either train an alexnet, go examples/image-classification, `python train-imagenet --network alexnet ...`. it only takes several hours on 4 gpus.\n2. or use vgg16/vgg19. we verified the results. e.g. `tools/caffe_converter/run.sh vgg16`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167167647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167168897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1041#issuecomment-167168897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1041","id":167168897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzE2ODg5Nw==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-24T23:53:24Z","updated_at":"2015-12-24T23:53:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"many thanks for the PR. it looks like you are using a simplified resnet? how about refactor the symbol definition into `examples/image-classification/symbol_resnet-small.py`, then we can train it on cifar10 by \n\n```\npython train_cifar10.py --network resnet-small ...\n```\n\nps. you may want to choose a better name but i hope to reserve `symbol_resnet.py` to the one can repeat their paper's results on imagenet\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167168897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167175381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1060#issuecomment-167175381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1060","id":167175381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzE3NTM4MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-25T01:23:58Z","updated_at":"2015-12-25T01:23:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"consider
