Hello Martin, thanks for the cleanup.\r\n> \r\n> If you removed all compilation warnings from the module, should you also make sure that once a new warning is introduced, the compilation fails?\r\n> \r\n> Because without such automatic check your work may not last. Traditionally the NetBeans community never paid much attention to warnings - as such I wouldn't even noticed if I re-introduced a warning.\r\n\r\nI fully agree with you.\r\n\r\nHowever, the only thing I've accomplished is correcting the linter warnings for specific types - namely the one listed in the description of this PR. With the current value of the `javac.compilerargs` property no more linter warnings are produced. This however does not mean that the compiler does not produce no warnings. The following warnings are an exerpt of the warning still produced during the build process:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.../nbbuild/build/public-package-jars/org-netbeans-api-annotations-common.jar(/org/netbeans/api/annotations/common/NonNull.class): warning: Cannot find annotation method 'when()' in type 'Nonnull': class file for javax.annotation.Nonnull not found\r\nwarning: unknown enum constant When.ALWAYS\r\n  reason: class file for javax.annotation.meta.When not found\r\n.../nbbuild/build/public-package-jars/org-netbeans-api-annotations-common.jar(/org/netbeans/api/annotations/common/NullAllowed.class): warning: Cannot find annotation method 'when()' in type 'Nonnull'\r\nwarning: unknown enum constant When.MAYBE\r\nwarning: No processor claimed any of these annotations: org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NullAllowed,org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NonNull\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting the `-Werror` javac flag then causes the build to fail rather fast.\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: warnings found and -Werror specified\r\n1 error\r\n5 warnings\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have not investigated what causes these messages nor how to fix them. That would propably be a job for someone that is more knowledgeable with the NetBeans buildsystem.\r\n\r\n> There is a `-Werror` javac flag. You should enable it when setting the `javac.compilerargs` property. Or (better) change `common.xml` to support a new property `javac.failOnWarnings=false` (`false` by default) that each cleaned up module could set to `true`.\r\n\r\nMy - at this stage rather pragmatic - opinion would be to add the `-Werror` to the `javac.compilerargs` property. Anyone acustomed to javac and its commandline argument knows what that does.\r\nAdmittably a new property `javac.failOnWarnings=false` has its charm as well but who knows how it is used in the build.\r\n\r\nJust a gut feelling...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/562842107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/562860277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1736#issuecomment-562860277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1736","id":562860277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Mjg2MDI3Nw==","user":{"login":"mklaehn","id":9751885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NTE4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9751885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn","html_url":"https://github.com/mklaehn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklaehn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-07T15:24:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T15:24:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Great, thanks for the clean ups.\r\n\r\nThanks.

we create a separate library wrapper jar to for jsr305 and make the commons annotations depend on it? Maybe more modular as a result. If we choose the existing approach a user always needs to depend on the NetBeans abstraction and cannot chose the original library as a dependency.

(Available by right-clicking the main NetBeans toolbar.) What do you think about enabling this option by default, in all LAFs?\r\n\r\nEnabling \"Small Toolbar Icons\" by default will have one advantage in the future, when we slowly start replacing bitmap toolbar icons with SVG versions. Currently, the toolbar requires two icon versions of each action--both 16x16 and 24x24. This is a hassle--in the future I imagine there will be just a single SVG image for each action which can be scaled to either size. It would be best if this could be a 16x16 version, which is then automatically scaled up to 24x24 if \"Small Toolbar Icons\" is disabled. Since this will scale up border widths as well, though, this means toolbar icons will look slightly more consistent in \"Small Toolbar Icons\" mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/564594925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/564705189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1771#issuecomment-564705189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1771","id":564705189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDcwNTE4OQ==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T19:52:06Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T19:52:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Build fails on sigtest public API signature test.
