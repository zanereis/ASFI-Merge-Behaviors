This is a convenient way to handle shutdown in bigger programs, where all parts of the program can't (and shouldn't) be aware of each other. \r\nAnother, maybe more common, way to quit a program is to simply to reach the end of the main method. But if there are any non-daemon threads running, they will not be shut down and thus the JVM will not exit. Thus, if you have any such non-daemon threads, you need some other means (than the shutdown hooks) to shut down all non-daemon threads and release other resources. If there are no other non-daemon threads, returning from main will shut down the JVM and will call the shutdown hooks.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I am glad to see this improvement, thanks @lindzh

sorry for late.\r\n\r\nI have last two questions:\r\n\r\n1. What's the default value `MetaspaceSize` and `MaxMetaspaceSize` in JDK8, and are these new value reasonable?\r\n2. Will these two parameters influence the low version JDK? like JDK7?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/341335627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/341336327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/188#issuecomment-341336327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/188","id":341336327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTMzNjMyNw==","user":{"login":"zhouxinyu","id":3961183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjExODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3961183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouxinyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-02T07:14:07Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T07:14:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks,\r\nbut please fork and merge your contribution to `develop` master, and use a meaningful title.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/341336327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/341602398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/186#issuecomment-341602398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/186","id":341602398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTYwMjM5OA==","user":{"login":"johnsonyang","id":2681014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2681014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang","html_url":"https://github.com/johnsonyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-03T01:15:29Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T01:24:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, zhou\r\n\r\nthanks you feedback quickly!\r\n\r\n1.
