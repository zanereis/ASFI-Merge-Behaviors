Use redefine strategy of Byte-Buddy in SkyWalking(I dont know why SkyWalking using rebase strategy, and I am not sure what it really effects when I changed it.)\r\n\r\nYou should not change this strategy, we choose this for a long history. This is a better way to do so.\r\n\r\n> Avoid enhanced private construtors of ForkJoinTask in transmitable-thread-local (This solution makes TTL compatible, but I have to change javassist code)\r\n> Do not enhance ForkJoinTask, enhance ForkJoinPool or some classes else. (This may solve my problem, but the compatible problem is still unresolved)\r\n\r\nWhat you have done, is your private codes. A TLP should not change anything because of a private codebase. This is a principle of an open source project. Especially this thing doesn't benefit the community at all.\r\n\r\nThe thing you do in your agent, could be done natively in SkyWalking's agent system. You should adopt a community, rather than ask a large community to adopt

I have used EndpointGroupingRuleReader4OpenapiTest and that class does not load my openapi definition which is over 3000 lines. I figured checkstyle is limiting the definition file limits. Can i increase these values via ENV variable?\r\n\r\nI think we don't limit size, and checkstyle is only working for IDE, rather than runtime. Could you share more about this?\r\n\r\n> 2 - I couldn't tell if skywalking-server correctly loaded my openapi file or not based on logs. I think there should be logging if no file loaded etc.\r\n\r\nWelcome to send a pull request to enhance this. This is a new feature, we are glad to see the feedback.\r\n\r\n> 3 - getGroupRegex method does not care for statically added server context paths. (For example endpoint is /records but server is setup as /api/records). This information usually goes to servers.url in openapi definition (server.url being '/api' in this case). Should we consider such setup?\r\n\r\nWe should consider that.
