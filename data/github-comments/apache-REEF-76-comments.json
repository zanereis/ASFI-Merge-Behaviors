thanks! I've fixed the code and squashed the last commits. Regarding the code style:\n1. I think we need blank lines to improve readability. e.g. I sometimes add blank lines to separate final member variables from the mutable ones, or use them between logical blocks of code - say, to separate logging from main logic, and so on. I think we can be a bit creative here as long as checkstyle does not complain.\n2. I agree that `this.` prefix is often redundant. We use that style from the beginning of the project because it was in some coding guidelines that we had followed then (or was it some default IDE setting?) Anyway, we are stuck with it now, so I use it to be consistent with the rest of the code.

However, The test code on the C# side appears to be incomplete compared to the java side so I am reticent to delete a class that we may need to provide complete test coverage on the C# side.\n\nThe RxTimeStage class class on the other hand is not used on either the java or C# side so I agree we should [Osolete] the RxTimerClass and subsequently delete it both in Java and C#. Java\n\nThe difference between TimerStage and RxTimerStage classes is that TimerStage calls EventHandler<PeriodicEvent> instance whereas calls an IStaticObservable for time out events.\n\n**JIRA description mentions System.Net.Dns which needs replacement but is still present here.
