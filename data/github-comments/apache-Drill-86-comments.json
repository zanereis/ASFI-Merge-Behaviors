These exceptions are logged (as WARNs), and are actually being swallowed by the ProtobufPatcher / GuavaPatcher, so the first question is:\r\n * how important are these patchers for the latest java / drill versions? If one can live without them, then the simplest 'solution' would be to ignore the warn logs from these classes.\r\n\r\nThese patchers also use Javassist’s toClass() without parameters, and I think they recommend to use toClass(Class<?> neighbor) now, to deal with illegal reflective access ([https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist/issues/369](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist/issues/369)) - though I’m not sure how helpful it will be here. \r\n\r\nIn my case (trying to run drill-jdbc in quarkus) I had to disable the Patchers explicitly, due to how javassist’s class patching conflicted with quarkus’ own classloader. Disabling them also kinda fixes java’s issues with illegal reflective access. But obviously, this is a very rough hack that I did just to have it working for now. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n//must run before drill’s driver was loaded \r\nvar protobufPatchingAttempted = ProtobufPatcher.class.getDeclaredField(\"patchingAttempted\"); \r\nprotobufPatchingAttempted.setAccessible(true); \r\nprotobufPatchingAttempted.setBoolean(null, true);  \r\n\r\nvar guavaPatchingAttempted = GuavaPatcher.class.getDeclaredField(\"patchingAttempted\"); \r\nguavaPatchingAttempted.setAccessible(true);\r\n guavaPatchingAttempted.setBoolean(null, true);\r\n ```\r\n\r\nI think everything so far doesn’t depend on having module-info in your project, and is caused by changes in reflective access checks since java 16. \r\n\r\nAs for named modules - while drill-jdbc works as an automatic module, it has some older dependencies that might cause conflicts down the road (e.g., quarkus requires netty 4.1+, but drill-memory-base depends on netty-buffer PoolArena from some older version, and fails with  ‘java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: Class io.netty.buffer.PoolArena does not have member field 'int chunkSize’’). \r\n\r\nAnd using drill-jdbc-all as a compile dependency with a named module is impossible, since it doesn’t shadow all the packages under the oadd umbrella, and sooner or later you’ll run into split package issue (e.g., ‘Module ‘your.module.name’ reads package 'org.w3c.dom' from both 'java.xml' and 'drill.jdbc.all'’ , when you add `requires java.sql` and `requires drill.jdbc.all` together). So this one can only be used as a runtime dependency.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1969173580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1969446309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2882#issuecomment-1969446309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2882","id":1969446309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc51Y12l","user":{"login":"Der-Joscha","id":18661166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjYxMTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18661166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha","html_url":"https://github.com/Der-Joscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Der-Joscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-28T17:04:22Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T17:04:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jnturton Currently we are working with a `DrillConnection` unwrapped from a call to `DriverManager.getConnection`.

We started some work a while ago to get rid of all the non-EVF2 readers in Drill.  It turns out that there are a few places which still use the old non-EVF JSON reader.  Specifically, this UDF, the Druid Storage Plugin and the MongoDB storage plugin.   I started work on [Drill-8316](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2657) which addresses the Druid plugin and [Drill-8329](https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2567) addresses converting the UDF.  Neither one of these were a high priority so they're kind of sitting at the moment. \r\n\r\nI agree with your premise that the whole idea of having global settings for file formats (including parquet) is not the best idea.\r\n\r\nGive me a day or two and I can add additional params to the UDF so that you can just change those settings in the query.\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/2212305704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/2212343161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2919#issuecomment-2212343161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2919","id":2212343161,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc6D3a15","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-07T06:41:33Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T06:41:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tooptoop4 I've got the needed access and I'm looking into it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/2212343161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/2212491446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2921#issuecomment-2212491446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2921","id":2212491446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc6D3_C2","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-07T15:50:48Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T15:50:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnturton I added new versions of the UDF so that the user can specify in the function call whether they want `allTextMode` and the other option.
