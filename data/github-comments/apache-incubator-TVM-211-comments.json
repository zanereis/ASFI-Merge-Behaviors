separate PR with the proposed `reinterpret_cast<__fp16*>` replacement.\r\n> However `reinterpret_cast<__fp16*>` is more elegant indeed (if toolchains would agree with us too).\r\n\r\n\r\nI've spent some time analysing this bug today. The language feature works with static linking but not without it - so that smells of an issue in the toolchain in my book since I wouldn't expect something like reinterpret_cast to depend on linkage methods. I think I have a reproducer to discuss further with the relevant GCC folks in the morning.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've gone back and re-read the man page for --static-libgcc as this isn't something that I've used before and that has the following note which raised my eyebrows and probably needs some more querying.\r\n\r\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-10.2.0/gcc/Link-Options.html#Link-Options\r\n\r\n\"However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, or using the option -shared-libgcc, such that it is linked with  the shared libgcc.\"\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced we can assert this is safe for all the API consumers of libtvm.so that exceptions wouldn't be received or thrown across the libtvm.so boundary ? On an offline conversation @junrushao1994 indicated that we may throw an exception across if someone were using a C++ API from libtvm.so in a C++ wrapper. I'm not sure about other usecases. Even if we did, I think it's risky to continue down the path of using --static-libgcc on one platform because you've got different behaviours on different hosts and we should look to avoid that for longer term maintenance. \r\n\r\nThus I think we should look for a workaround till this is discussed with the GCC community more.

But it is not clear if the fix would come any time soon ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/690033256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/690039542","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6268#issuecomment-690039542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6268","id":690039542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MDAzOTU0Mg==","user":{"login":"t-vi","id":20787943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzg3OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20787943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi","html_url":"https://github.com/t-vi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-vi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-10T07:13:32Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T07:18:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> `torch.result_type` is confused with one of the inputs being numpy scalar of type np.int64, and it returns float32 when both lhs and rhs are clearly int64\r\n\r\nOh, indeed, I missed that at first!

for the pointer @anijain2305. I do agree this is a better approach. I have an example working on my end for my use-case, although it seems quite messy. Setting temporary attributes i.e. `FTVMConvertOpLayout` on the C++ side of things is more difficult than from python. The reason I need to do this in C++ is because I run the convert layout pass in Arm Compute Library codegen.\r\n \r\nI've had a go at implementing something like the `TempOpAttr` class from python in C++. This is to ensure I'm only setting this config for the Arm Compute Library codegen. Although, this involves fetching a series of packed functions (namely OpGetAttr, OpResetAttr and OpSetAttr) from `src/ir/op.cc` which doesn't sound right. I'm just wondering if it sounds like I'm completely off piste with this or whether you know of anything that could help that I've missed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/690476905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/690504454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6430#issuecomment-690504454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6430","id":690504454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MDUwNDQ1NA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-10T16:55:51Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T16:56:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think calling ConvertLayout in C++ should be ok.
