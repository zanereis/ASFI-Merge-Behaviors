call them \"finance\"), but they\nshould otherwise have exactly the same rights as the \"viewer\" users.

I know it can be done by configuring the permissions, but\n1. the permission setting is so complicated and is already a mess (to me). There are already too many permissions and it's confusing and not straightforward for the users. The users don't know what permissions can be tweaked and permissions for different purposes are all mixed together in one place. You can see the problem by looking at the long list of permissions of Admin and Alpha roles. By moving it to a separate place, it will be clear and specific. and \n2. we don't have to create permissions for each dashboard. if we have 30 dashboards, we will have to create 30 permissions. It's, again, too complicated to me.\n\nI really wished I could reuse the logic of the permissions. If you still don't think it's a good idea to create another table for dashboard access, maybe another thing we should do is to improve the permission editing page to make it straightforward to the users.\nOr maybe keep the new form field \"role access\" in this pull request, but when the form is saved, finish the logic using ab_permission instead of a new table. But I am not sure if it is feasible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/220126394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/220156613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/478#issuecomment-220156613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/478","id":220156613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDE1NjYxMw==","user":{"login":"itajaja","id":697647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/697647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja","html_url":"https://github.com/itajaja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itajaja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T21:00:38Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T21:00:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any reason why this stalled?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/220156613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/220159408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/477#issuecomment-220159408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/477","id":220159408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDE1OTQwOA==","user":{"login":"asydorchuk","id":1106937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1106937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk","html_url":"https://github.com/asydorchuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asydorchuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T21:11:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T21:11:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@x4base, sounds reasonable to me, however I am not the owner of the repo.

am working on an Apache Drill Sql Alchemy Dialect. I have some basic things working, and have been working with others on the Drill mailing list.
