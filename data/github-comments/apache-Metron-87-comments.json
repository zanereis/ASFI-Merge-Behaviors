I'm a little confused - the only place I think we deal with timestamp fields and/or properties is in the parserConfig itself (the very specifically named object within the broader parser configuration - yeah, calling something a \"parserConfig\" within a parser config is a bit confusing to try to discuss accurately). Anyhow, where is/was the other \"TIMESTAMP\" property being set if not in the \"parserConfig\" object? Specifically for Grok parsers, (e.g. Yaf, Squid) isn't this just a matter of requiring the \"timestampField\" property in the config section?\r\n\r\nIt's possible this is a problematic request bc of how that parserConfig object is handled in the UI, but you might also consider making \"TIMESTAMP\" readonly and simply grab the value from \"timestampField\", with the error message reflecting the same. I'm not sure I completely understand the problem in the UI, so maybe we can discuss this a bit further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/549564015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/549572670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1546#issuecomment-549572670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1546","id":549572670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTU3MjY3MA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-04T22:16:30Z","updated_at":"2019-11-04T22:16:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have not run spellcheck again, does it pass now?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/549572670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/549877351","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1546#issuecomment-549877351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1546","id":549877351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTg3NzM1MQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T15:38:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T15:38:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ottobackwards Any thoughts on this comment also? https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1546#issuecomment-548510246\r\n\r\nWRT shellcheck, I fixed a couple issues, as indicated in my earlier comments.

This script currently matches our style and patterns on escaping/variable expansion in all our other shell scripts. Anything I'm missing you're specifically requesting? I don't think I agree with the checker that we should go quoting every variable in this case, but maybe there's a good reason for it.

This also explains why we do not see the value of an existing parser in that field. The validator for that input looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngroup['timestampField'] = new FormControl(\r\n      this.sensorParserConfig.timestampField,\r\n      Validators.required\r\n    );\r\n```\r\nThat first parameter in FormControl is what a field's default value should be. It should be looking at `this.sensorParserConfig.parserConfig.timestampField` instead given what is currently returned. I \r\n haven't looked into whether this is the result of miscommunication at implementation or a change in what the REST endpoint is returning, but this is why it currently doesn't work.\r\n\r\n> Specifically for Grok parsers, (e.g. Yaf, Squid) isn't this just a matter of requiring the \"timestampField\" property in the config section?\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what I implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\n> you might also consider making \"TIMESTAMP\" readonly and simply grab the value from \"timestampField\", with the error message reflecting the same\r\n\r\nI could do this. Given the way we currently present the parserConfig object in the UI, I felt it was better to keep the property in the parserConfig. However, I can be swayed to take this approach if others feel it's better to have an input field separate from the parserConfig section.\r\n\r\nWhen I made this PR, I made a lot of assumptions based on what is implemented in the UI. This is why I originally mentioned that the REST API should be updated to have timestampField as a property on the Grok parser itself. However, if it belongs inside the parserConfig object, I would rather include it as part of the parserConfig section in the UI. Unless anyone objects, I'm going to proceed to add validation onto the work I did and update here when I have that done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/550058047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/550076315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1546#issuecomment-550076315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1546","id":550076315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDA3NjMxNQ==","user":{"login":"tigerquoll","id":8340922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDA5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8340922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll","html_url":"https://github.com/tigerquoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigerquoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T23:50:32Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T23:50:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 (non-binding)\r\nI gave these scripts a test when updating Metron 0.7.1 (HDP 2.6) -> Metron HDP 3.1 support branch.  They worked well, though I only setup Metron 0.71 with a handful of tutorial/walkthroughs beforehand, so the updated fresh Metron install was similar in respects to the configuration I updated it to.  There could be edge cases not covered by a simple upgrade test (such as a larger version upgrade jump).  But it's definitely better having the scripts than not having them.  For any serious production upgrade I would recommend:\r\n1. Use the script to pull the configuration of the existing Metron install\r\n2. Using the script to pull the configuration down from a freshly installed Metron update, \r\n2. Manually comparing / updating the differences in the pulled configuration files\r\n3. Using the script to push the updated configurations into the upgraded cluster that has the freshly installed Metron/Mpack on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/550076315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/550291563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1554#issuecomment-550291563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1554","id":550291563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDI5MTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T12:39:19Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T12:49:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc Given how large this PR is, here's a git command that *should* just pull out the `src` files that changed. `git difftool` will also work if you have that setup.

For the past several years, its been standard practice to use a chrooted / namespaced environment for storing solr information in zookeeper.   The practical effects of this is to need to prepend '/solr' to any zookeeper ensemble URLs.  The use of chrooted zookeeper configurations is the default in both lucidworks/HWX SOLR (from 4.0), and for Cloudera SOLR (not sure which version but for many years).  It has also been the documented recommendation for Apache SOLR Cloud since approximately version 6.6.\r\n> \r\n> End result is, if Metron is dealing with a SOLR cluster that has been installed or updated any time in the past couple of years, it is dealing with a SOLR configuration stored in a chrooted Zookeeper environment.  \r\n> \r\n> The problem is the Metron SOLR collection create/destroy scripts assume that we are not using a CHROOTed environment, and fail badly when the expected SOLR configuration is not present at the expected location in SOLR.  Buried in the readme is instruction on how to set modify the zookeeper environment variables before running the script to add chrooted address, and when the scripts are used by Ambari, they are called using the correct chrooted quorum URL, because there is a seperate configuration item that can be set to indicate the chroot zookeeper address for SOLR.\r\n> \r\n> Having just been burnt by this I think we should at least\r\n> \r\n> Cleanly catch the failure of the zkcli command in the collection scripts when it queries for zookeeper state that is not present\r\n> If the zkcli error is caught, make a suggestion in the error message to check for a chrooted SOLR cloud zookeeper configuration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/553654284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/553969471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1554#issuecomment-553969471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1554","id":553969471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mzk2OTQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-14T16:34:52Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T16:34:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Adding this link for reference/posterity - https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/\r\n\r\nAnd this will be useful for folks contributing test fixes and new tests after the transition - https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/553969471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/553988830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1559#issuecomment-553988830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1559","id":553988830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Mzk4ODgzMA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-14T17:18:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T17:18:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What are we actually doing with `log4j-over-slf4j` at all?

On the other hand, I wonder if we are actually confusing users by keeping the up/down arrows.

They try to `exit` if an error occurs, but `exit` during a pipe chain doesn't stop the chain, so it ends up passing along to builtins that exit with 0 (because for `grep`, `sort`, etc, nothing went wrong).

Unfortunately, this test case would not have caught this specific bug.  I still added it in hopes of catching potential future problems.\r\n\r\nNow why can't our tests replicate this bug?  \r\n\r\nIt appears that the original problem is only triggered when running against the HDP-flavor of Spark and its dependencies.  This is the \"flavor\" that you would get when running Metron in a cluster deployed with Ambari and the MPack.  \r\n\r\nThe issue cannot be replicated in the integration tests as they are run against the against the pure, open source version of Spark and its dependencies, which are slightly different.\r\n\r\nNow the only way I could really prove this theory is if I were to attempt to run all of our integration tests against the HDP-flavor of each of our dependencies.  It seems like this would be a rather time-consuming task.  It might be really useful to define a separate profile that builds against the HDP-flavor of dependencies that we could use to potentially catch issues like this, but it seems a bit overkill for this specific bug.\r\n\r\nI am less concerned with the tests here because the fix included in this PR actually removes some of the ugly scaffolding that I had to use (ProfileMeasurementAdapter) to get this working originally.  I see this (along with #1556) as the approach I would have preferred to take originally had I been able to get it working at the time.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could be persuaded otherwise.
