Which (hopefully) would have been constructed previously, so we wouldn't have to set extra options like I mentioned above. Does that sound right? While much simpler I think its important that the user doesn't have to set options in the `read`/`write` spark commands, rather set them once in `SparkConf`.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we could set a default catalog in `SparkConf`` (eg `spark.iceberg.default_catalog=com.my.own.CatalogImpl`)? If set the readers/writers will use that unless an `option` is passed. If neither is passed it would default to the current Hive/HDFS impl.\r\n\r\nI believe that this still causes an issue in Spark2 as it doesn't have the same (spark) catalog support. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731137385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731148555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1791#issuecomment-731148555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1791","id":731148555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTE0ODU1NQ==","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T12:42:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T12:42:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds good to me, we might need to implement those methods in `FlinkCatalog`: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public List<CatalogPartitionSpec> listPartitions(ObjectPath tablePath)\r\n      throws CatalogException {\r\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public List<CatalogPartitionSpec> listPartitions(ObjectPath tablePath, CatalogPartitionSpec partitionSpec)\r\n      throws CatalogException {\r\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public List<CatalogPartitionSpec> listPartitionsByFilter(ObjectPath tablePath, List<Expression> filters)\r\n      throws CatalogException {\r\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\r\n  }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731148555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731214967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1789#issuecomment-731214967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1789","id":731214967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTIxNDk2Nw==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T14:51:39Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T14:54:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Looks like the log is too long with this enabled:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> This file has been truncated.

I think we can fix some of the problems with this by using the current catalog from the catalog manager if there is no catalog identifier in the table name.\r\n\r\nHere's what I think is the _correct_ thing to do for table identifiers in Spark 3:\r\n1. Parse the identifier into parts\r\n2. Follow the logic in `LookupCatalog`: if there is only one part, use the current catalog and current namespace. If there are multiple parts, check whether the first one is a catalog and use it if it is. After this, we have a catalog and a table identifier.\r\n3. Check that the catalog is an Iceberg catalog. If not, throw an exception. _Not entirely sure about this one._\r\n4. Return the catalog and identifier through [`SupportsCatalogOptions`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/SupportsCatalogOptions.java).\r\n\r\nThat way, we're just using the source to translate back to catalogs.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is the behavior when there is no catalog specified in the identifier. The current behavior is to use a `HiveCatalog` that connects to the URI from `hive-site.xml` like the built-in Spark session catalog. That conflicts with the SQL behavior of using the current catalog, but may be reasonable to keep compatibility. But then the problem is that we may not have a registered Iceberg catalog that uses that URI. If not, then there is no catalog for the source to delegate to and we need to create one because a catalog is required if the source implements `SupportsCatalogOptions`.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to change the current behavior slightly and go with the \"correct\" logic for Spark 3 and delegate to the current catalog. That would mean we always have a catalog to delegate to without creating one. But the trade-off is that when the current catalog has changed, the table loaded by `IcebergSource` would change, too. I'd be open to this option.\r\n\r\nLast, how to handle path URIs: I talked with Anton and Russell about this yesterday and we think that we should make it so that every Spark catalog can load special path identifiers, just like we do today in `IcebergSource`. To do this, we would need to have a way to pass an identifier that signals this behavior back from `SupportsCatalogOptions`, like `iceberg.hdfs://nn:8020/path/to/table`. Then detect those and return Hadoop tables for them.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731352161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731360511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1587#issuecomment-731360511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1587","id":731360511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTM2MDUxMQ==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T19:18:44Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T19:18:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks again for the thorough review @rdblue I have updated w/ your suggestions and rebased. hope I didn't miss anything!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731360511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731365732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1789#issuecomment-731365732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1789","id":731365732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTM2NTczMg==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T19:30:33Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T19:30:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @pvary, looks great!

You can see the results here in the artifact: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/runs/1429922302\r\n\r\nI found them lacking because of 2 reasons:\r\n1. Hive often does not propagate the exception to the client (the theory is that infra errors should not be handled by the users), so Hive based tests produce the following exceptions without enough details to investigate (INFO logs contain the real Exception):\r\n```\r\norg.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.TestHiveIcebergStorageHandlerWithCustomCatalog > testScanTable[fileFormat=PARQUET, engine=tez] FAILED\r\n    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to execute Hive query 'SELECT * FROM default.customers ORDER BY customer_id DESC': Error while processing statement: FAILED\r\n: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.tez.TezTask\r\n        Caused by:\r\n        org.apache.hive.service.cli.HiveSQLException: Error while processing statement: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.tez.TezTask\r\n```\r\n2. Having separate directories for listing the tests for every subproject does not help in identifying the failing test at glance\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd option I have tried the [official](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/v5.4.1/subprojects/docs/src/samples/testing/testReport/groovy/build.gradle) solution for aggregating the results, but it only does the aggregation if there is no test failure which is less than ideal 😄\r\n\r\nSo that is why I have decided to backtrack to the \"have a file for a subproject output and keep the original test output\" solution.\r\n\r\nAfter my trip to the test output aggregation I feel that if we want to have aggregate test results then it should be done in a different PR and here we should concentrate on the archiving the logs","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731365732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731375657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1796#issuecomment-731375657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1796","id":731375657,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTM3NTY1Nw==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T19:51:40Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T19:51:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let me update this one to handle orphan files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731375657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/731377811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1789#issuecomment-731377811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1789","id":731377811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTM3NzgxMQ==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T19:56:23Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T19:56:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought that logs printed to stderr and stdout were available in the test reports.

How important or even valid is it to load non-path based tables through our source in Spark 3?

Since we have proper catalog API in Spark 3, shall we assume all catalog-based tables should be loaded through it and not through source?

How would you use atomic write instead? \r\n\r\nCurrently, when using hadoop tables, `HadoopTableOperations` assumes atomic rename guarantees, and (when committing) proceeds to rename the temp snapshot object from its temp name to the snapshot object name.\r\nHowever - atomic write can also be used - instead of using the temp object, we can directly (and atomically) write the snapshot object. the write will succeed iff the object did not exist.\r\n\r\n> And how would you detect whether to use atomic write or atomic rename?\r\n\r\nI think using a config on a scheme level makes sense (this way one can control on which FS to use atomic write and on which ones to stay with atomic rename) since atomic write/ atomic rename are FS level guarantees.\r\n\r\n> In general, I would not recommend using a file system for this guarantee. It's better to use a database transaction for the atomic update operation. That's why we want to have support for a variety of catalog plugins in addition to Hive, like JDBC, Nessie, and Glue.\r\n\r\nYes; however (also keeping in mind that this is all in the context of hadoop tables, which in any case rely on file system guarantees) - adding support for atomic write is a relatively low-hanging fruit, and storage systems such as IBM Cloud Object Storage can then be used even without an external catalog.\r\n\r\nwhile we discuss this, i'll open a PR with the changes i have in mind.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/732855802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/732978124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1804#issuecomment-732978124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1804","id":732978124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMjk3ODEyNA==","user":{"login":"STTianXiang","id":50575666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTc1NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50575666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang","html_url":"https://github.com/STTianXiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/STTianXiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-24T13:38:02Z","updated_at":"2020-11-24T13:38:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"![Uploading
