If we want to attach this timestamp to the records as the default event time in the future, we'd definitely need a separate module (0.10 timestamp feature not included in this PR).\n2. `PartitionMetaData` (used in `KafkaTestEnvironmentImpl`s) has a breaking change to the APIs for retrieving the info, so we can't simply bump the version either.\n\nOther than the above, the rest of the code is the same between (or changes are irrelevant to Kafka API changes) the 0.9 connector. I've also tried using the Kafka 0.9 connector with 0.10 installation, and it works.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/237793249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/237796941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2231#issuecomment-237796941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2231","id":237796941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzc5Njk0MQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T08:58:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T08:59:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@radekg One thing that's missing is updating the docs.

@aljoscha \nMaybe we can use different db instance for different key group. this approach can only work well when key group number is limited to a certain number which can not be too large. \nSince the max number of key groups is limited by the max parallelism config, I think different db instances can work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/238883268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/238887433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2231#issuecomment-238887433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2231","id":238887433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODg4NzQzMw==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-10T14:38:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T14:38:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@radekg,

The constructor should complete before the rpc endpoint is reachable. \n\nWith the former implementation there was a similar problem though: First you start the actor and then you initialize the self context. If a message arrived between these two calls which triggers access to the self context, it would have caused a NPE.\n\nMaybe one can solve the problem by not publishing the connection address of the rpc endpoint before the constructor has been executed? Then no gateway could connect against the endpoint and send request until the whole endpoint has been initialized.\n\nOr we let the underlying rpc server (e.g. actor) ignore all messages until he has been explicitly told differently.
