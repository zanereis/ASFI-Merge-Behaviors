However, after the consumer first starts, it only receives 2, 3, 4, 5, and then has to wait a long time to receive the missing message, which is the number 1.\n\nI use this method to verify the consumption order of RocketMQ. A simple consumer's message receiving operation should be sequential and atomic, so I should receive number 1 first instead of 2. This is problematic.\n\nThe type of my topic is FIFO, and all messages are sent to the same group. My message sending operation is synchronous, which means my message producer ensures the order.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2112647823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2112712666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8149#issuecomment-2112712666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8149","id":2112712666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl8597W_a","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-15T14:32:57Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T01:57:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/rocketmq/pull/8149?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `25.00000%` with `3 lines` in your changes missing coverage.

Furthermore, there’s a safeguard in NettyServerHandler#channelWritabilityChanged to ensure that an excess of responses isn’t dispatched (a similar approach is adopted by other products). In most cases, connections originate from the client. By not reading and processing requests from the client, the server can remove the channel through an application layer schedule task scan. From the above issue, it's not entirely clear what problem this is intended to solve. Is it possible to adjust the server watermark to address this?\r\n\r\n不写回 response 主要就是为了防止反压导致服务端 oom，然后 NettyServerHandler#channelWritabilityChanged 这里还有个保护（其他产品也是类似的做法）保证不会丢到过多的 response。大多数情况下，连接来自客户端，不处理来自客户端的请求之后，服务端可以通过应用层 scan channel 来移除 channel，同时释放内存。从上述 issue 没太理解是为了解决什么问题，是否可以调整 server watermakr 来解决？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2119844313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2119993482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/8169#issuecomment-2119993482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8169","id":2119993482,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85-XIiK","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-20T08:56:40Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T11:30:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/rocketmq/pull/8169?dropdown=coverage&src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAttention: Patch coverage is `0%` with `2 lines` in your changes missing coverage.
