If a bert model for example had 4 default shapes, this approach would allow us to specify `seq_len=[256]` while leaving the other 3 shapes alone.

To support `-inf`, I had to change `Tokenize()` loop, because I have to tokenize `-` and `inf` separately. I refactored the tokenizer a bit to clean up how to handle negation of both normal numbers and `inf`.\r\n\r\nNow, a digit parsing in `TokenizeOnce` does not handle negation and  `ParseNumber` always returns a positive number. The trailing negations are handled in `Tokenize()` loop. \r\n\r\nThis way, negation of positive numbers and `inf` are done in a unified way.

The behavior of `stod` also agrees with this.\r\n\r\nI also noticed we could maybe use `MatchString` to directly match on `\"inf\"`.

Maybe there is something wrong with `If` and the rewrite.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/769847098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/769849074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7363#issuecomment-769849074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7363","id":769849074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTg0OTA3NA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T14:49:05Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T14:49:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One thing I'm curious, the crash at CI https://ci.tlcpack.ai/job/tvm/job/main/ is very frequent, while CIs for open PRs do not get crash (except https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-7360/1/pipeline/ which was timeout) as far as I see it.

Running `test_object_detection.py` indeed results in a segfault at the end, after correct execution. I didn't notice this segfault before because I was running a different script when I was working on optimizing MaskRCNN.\r\n\r\nNow, I wondered why running one script results in the segfault, while the other doesn't, when two scripts do essentially the same thing. And then I remembered the ONNX + PyTorch segfault problem, which was caused by pytorch being imported earlier than ONNX, see https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2394#issuecomment-581638840\r\n\r\n`test_object_detection.py` indeed imports pytorch before TVM, while my other script imports TVM first. So I simply swap the import order in `test_object_detection.py` , and the segfault is gone. If I import torch first in my other scripts, segfault now happens, as expected. I can 100% reproduce this issue of segfault and import order. \r\n\r\nConclusion: When using PyTorch 1.7 + CUDA, always import TVM first, before torch.
