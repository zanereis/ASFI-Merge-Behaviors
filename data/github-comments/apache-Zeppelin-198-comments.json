At that time, you need to re-execute travis ci and then update the travis address in the PR.\r\n\r\nYup. I can see from the logs that there's some mysql issue, not related to the fix I did. I will be waiting till the issue is resolved between travis and mysql :)\r\n\r\nOnce tests are passed, I will update CI address in the PR.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot @liuxunorg ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/515488963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/515813164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3414#issuecomment-515813164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3414","id":515813164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTgxMzE2NA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T01:19:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T01:19:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution @Byeol Could you add one line of comment so that it will be easier for others to understand it when reading zeppelin code.
