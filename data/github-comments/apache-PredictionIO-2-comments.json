Total: `O(categories + items * average(categories per item) * size(Int))`\n- Time: There's a set lookup (effectively constant time) for each considered item and for each queried category. Total: `O(considered items * queried categories)`\n\n**Alternative approach**\n- Storage: There is an `Item` and a `List` object for each item, plus a `String` for each match between a category and an item. Total: `O(items + items * average(categories per item) * size(String))`  \n- Time: For each considered item, there's a check between each of the item categories and each of the query categories. Total: `O(considered items * average(categories per item) * queried categories)`\n\nThe storage cost in the alternative approach would be a bit higher, since a `String` takes more space than an `Int`. This could be solved by mapping category `String`s to `Int`s as it's done for user and item ids. The number of items is probably going to be in general higher than the number of categories, but this part of the expression is not going to dominate except in very sparse sets of data.\n\nRegarding time, the alternative approach would also be a bit more costly, but this could also be solved by substituting the `List` of categories by a `Set` of categories.\n\nWith these two optimizations, both storage and time cost would be equivalent between the two alternatives. \n\nI've thought about another possible storage optimization, which would not help in the asymptotic case but would probably help in most real-life cases. That would be, in the alternative approach, to try to have the JVM reuse the `List` or `Set` of item categories where two items have the same set of categories. E.g., if there are two films that are both \"action\" and \"adventure\", in the naive implementation there would be 2 `List(\"action\", \"adventure\")` objects (with the possible `Set` and `Int` variants), while we could detect those cases and reuse a single object. Testing on the 100k MovieLens data, from 1682 total items there are only 216 different sets of categories. In other domains with more categories, though, the benefits of this approach would be less.\n\nPlease let me know which variation do you prefer to have implemented.\n\nKind regards,\nArtur\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/80202997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/81233051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/78#issuecomment-81233051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/78","id":81233051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjMzMDUx","user":{"login":"dszeto","id":1388362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODgzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto","html_url":"https://github.com/dszeto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-15T20:43:12Z","updated_at":"2015-03-15T20:43:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/81233051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/81971548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/76#issuecomment-81971548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/76","id":81971548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTcxNTQ4","user":{"login":"k4hoo","id":2480948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODA5NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2480948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo","html_url":"https://github.com/k4hoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k4hoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-16T22:44:16Z","updated_at":"2015-03-16T22:44:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

This is why it seems incomplete, as only the quorum configuration is required if you have a setup connecting to a remote HBase cluster.\n\n`$PIO_STORAGE_SOURCES_HBASE_HOME` was recently added for the `bin/pio-start-all` script. Agree that `HBASE_CONF_DIR` can be derived from that variable if we always require `$PIO_STORAGE_SOURCES_HBASE_HOME` to be set. `bin/pio-start-all`, however, is designed for quick-and-dirty standalone setups, so `$PIO_STORAGE_SOURCES_HBASE_HOME` does not necessary need to exist for distributed setups. Despite the fact that they serve different purposes, I agree that the current documentation is not clear and makes them kind of confusing.\n\nSo in summary, the current situation is due to some hacking to handle all of the following cases:\n- PIO with remote HBase\n- PIO with bundled local HBase\n- PIO with non-bundled local HBase\n\nI do not have a better solution at the code level at the moment, besides improving the documentation.

Thanks for creating the ticket. I didn't know it was that simple >.<\n\nI tried to reuse the single event creation code but the return types are different so I was stuck. For single event, the completion handler returns `(status, Map(\"message\": \"...\"))` while each event in the batch request returns `Map(\"status\": 400, \"message\": \"...\")`. Do you have any tips on how to refactor this?\n\nBtw, should I update the documentation page to reflect this support for batch

Even if we return an global error code when a single event failed to create, we still have to go through all events to check which exact event fails in order to retry.

But then the client also has to check the response format to determine if it is handling a batch or single request. I think this creates unnecessary work.
