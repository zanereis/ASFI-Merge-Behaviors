I'm surprised that the Cassandra and ES tests in hadoop/inputformat do not include scripts for generating the data, that seems problematic. @ssisk , do you know what's up with that?\r\n\r\nHowever, the original intention of those Cassandra and ES tests was to validate HadoopInputFormatIO itself, which is not the case of your PR (the intention of your PR is simply to demonstrate how to use it with HiveIO, correct?)\r\n\r\nThe substantial part of your PR, relevant to people who want to use Beam with Hive, is the `getConfiguration` method and `myValueTranslate`. I'm wondering if perhaps the proper place for the code in this PR is a StackOverflow question with a self-answer (perhaps linking to a gist), rather than code committed to the Beam repo?\r\n\r\nE.g. you could post a question \"How do I read from Hive using Apache Beam?\" and self-answer it with the `getConfiguration` snippet.

think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/302241184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/302241377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2850#issuecomment-302241377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2850","id":302241377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjI0MTM3Nw==","user":{"login":"markflyhigh","id":4008895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDg4OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4008895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh","html_url":"https://github.com/markflyhigh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markflyhigh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T21:48:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T21:48:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Run
