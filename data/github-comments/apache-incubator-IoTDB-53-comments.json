My setup consists of three Docker containers:\r\n\r\n1. apache/iotdb:0.12.4-node\r\n2. apache/iotdb:0.12.4-grafana (or as stated before [my own Option 2 iotdb-grafana installation](https://github.com/promouseus/open-field_time-series/blob/main/iotdb-grafana/Dockerfile))\r\n3. [grafana/grafana:latest based container](https://github.com/promouseus/open-field_time-series/blob/main/grafana/Dockerfile) with the [data source configured](https://github.com/promouseus/open-field_time-series/blob/main/grafana/iotdb.yaml)\r\n\r\nFor testing I add some time-series with a bash script like this:\r\n```\r\niotdbCli='docker exec -it iotdb /iotdb/sbin/start-cli.sh -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root'\r\n${iotdbCli} -e \"set storage group to root.sentico\"\r\n${iotdbCli} -e \"CREATE TIMESERIES root.sentico.portal.ipv4.\\\"10.20.20.254\\\".rtt WITH DATATYPE=FLOAT, ENCODING=RLE\"\r\n${iotdbCli} -e \"CREATE TIMESERIES root.sentico.portal.ipv4.\\\"1.1.1.1\\\".rtt WITH DATATYPE=FLOAT, ENCODING=RLE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I create some data by running the following bash script a couple of times:\r\n```\r\ntimestamp=`date +%s%3N`\r\nrtt1=`ping 8.8.8.8 -qc1|tail -n 1|awk -F' ' '{print $4}'|awk -F'/' '{print $1}'`\r\nrtt2=`ping 1.1.1.1 -qc1|tail -n 1|awk -F' ' '{print $4}'|awk -F'/' '{print $1}'`\r\n\r\n${iotdbCli} -e \"INSERT INTO root.sentico.portal.ipv4.\\\"10.20.20.254\\\"(timestamp,rtt) values(${timestamp},${rtt1})\"\r\n${iotdbCli} -e \"INSERT INTO root.sentico.portal.ipv4.\\\"1.1.1.1\\\"(timestamp,rtt) values(${timestamp},${rtt2})\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing above for 0.12.3 and 0.12.4 results in the log file as supplied. If I leave container 1 (iotdb-node) and 3 (grafana) in tact and only change container 2 (iotdb-grafana) back to 0.12.2 everything is working immediately. So the problem seems isolated to the iotdb-grafana 0.12.3 and 0.12.4 version. For now I use iotdb-node 0.12.4 combined with iotdb-grafana 0.12.2 and that seems to work (at least in my basic tests).\r\n\r\nIf you need any more information or I can assist you with something, please let me know.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJeffrey","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1001644295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1001827287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4607#issuecomment-1001827287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4607","id":1001827287,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM47tqvX","user":{"login":"HTHou","id":25913899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTEzODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25913899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou","html_url":"https://github.com/HTHou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HTHou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-28T01:50:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-28T01:50:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any update of this PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1001827287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1001829119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/4644#issuecomment-1001829119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/4644","id":1001829119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM47trL_","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-28T01:58:00Z","updated_at":"2021-12-28T01:58:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Kudos, SonarCloud Quality Gate passed!&nbsp;

The gap is within the fluctuation range because the write bottleneck is not the optimized function.\r\n- The query throughput before improvement is 5,648,345 pt/s and 6,767,949 pt/s after improvement.
