SpamAssassin uses the Apache.org svn repository. For projects that use svn, ASF mirrors the svn repository in a read-only git copy. Your pull request generated an email  to the developers mailing list from the mirrored git repository that got stuck in moderation as not coming from a subscribed address. Since we use svn we are not set up to deal with pull requests sent to the read-only mirrored git repository.\n\nThanks,\n\n One of the dev@ mailing list moderators for Apache SpamAssassin\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spamassassin/issues/comments/85206502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spamassassin/issues/comments/85519068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spamassassin/pull/1#issuecomment-85519068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spamassassin/issues/1","id":85519068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTE5MDY4","user":{"login":"g3offrey","id":11151445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTUxNDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11151445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey","html_url":"https://github.com/g3offrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g3offrey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-24T14:23:44Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T14:13:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you sidney for these informations.
