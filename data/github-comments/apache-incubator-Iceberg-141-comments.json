In flink, hivecatalog supports Hadoop conf dir option to configure the configuration file of each catalog separately.\r\nhttps://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/connectors/table/hive/overview/#:~:text=hadoop%2Dconf%2Ddir,each%20HiveCatalog%20separately.\r\nbut flink iceberg catalog has no this option ? I think it is more convenient to add new cluster configuration","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1016436478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1016598035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3927#issuecomment-1016598035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3927","id":1016598035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX848mA4T","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-19T15:45:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T15:45:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @cccs-eric !\r\n\r\n@rdblue can you take a look?
