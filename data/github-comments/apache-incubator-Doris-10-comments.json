Why do we choose to store one BF per column per row block (1024 rows)? This seems to have a fairly high storage and search overhead. For example, let's say a column contains 10M rows and thus 10K blocks. Under the default fpp which 5%, the size of each BF is around  800 bytes. So the total size of this BF index is ~8MB which is very large(for comparison, the uncompressed size of int column with 10M rows is 40MB). To evaluate a \"in\" predicate with `n` values, `10K` BFs need to be tested on `n` values, which could also take a long time.\r\n> 2. Size of BF depends on `expected_entries`, which is the number of unique values that will get inserted. Currently `expected_entries` is set to num_rows_per_block, which is too large for row block that contains many repeated values. How about allocating one BF for k distinct values instead of k rows? We can use the BF we're building to de-duplicate inputs.\r\n> 3. Classic BF (the one Doris is currently using) is known to be cache unfriendly. Have you considered BlockedBloomFilter which is used by Parquet and RocksDB?
