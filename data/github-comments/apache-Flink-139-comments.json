I've actually found out the reason for `HttpConnectionParams.setSoKeepalive` error, noted in the last comment in JIRA. Cross-posting it here so we don't need to jump around two places:\n\nIt seems like that the `flink-dist` jar that comes natively with EMR 5.1.0 hasn't shaded `httpclient` / `httpcore` properly (it contains the wrong unshaded classes). On other EMR versions where we need to download the Flink binaries ourselves, the class `HttpConnectionParams` was correctly loaded from user jars (this is the expected behaviour because our distributed Flink binaries has the classes shaded in the Hadoop dependency; see [1]). However, on EMR 5.1.0, it was loading the wrong unshaded class from their own shipped `flink-dist` jar.\n\nIs it possible that AWS have built Flink themselves for EMR 5.1.0, and used Maven 3.3.x which lead to incorrect shading of the apache http classes? If that's the case we should probably notify AWS of the problem.\n\n[1] http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/Kinesis-connector-classpath-issue-when-running-Flink-1-1-SNAPSHOT-on-YARN-td7611.html\n\nIf it was the situation that you described, I would expect that the `HttpConnectionParams.setSoKeepalive` error would occur on multiple EMR versions, which doesn't seem to be the case (for example EMR 5.0.3 uses Hadoop Amazon 2.7.3, same as EMR 5.1.0, but only 5.1.0 has the error).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260030612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260047836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2431#issuecomment-260047836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2431","id":260047836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDA0NzgzNg==","user":{"login":"iampeter","id":713801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzgwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter","html_url":"https://github.com/iampeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T20:25:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T20:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mushketyk looks good, thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260047836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260125056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2703#issuecomment-260125056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2703","id":260125056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDEyNTA1Ng==","user":{"login":"Makman2","id":6023916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMjM5MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2","html_url":"https://github.com/Makman2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Makman2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-12T14:28:21Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T14:28:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Btw shall I use \"fixup commits\" or fix the commit directly?

The labels should either be categorical variables (e.g. {Male, Female, Uknown}) or class labels. The case with the most unique values might be vocabulary words, which will range in the few million unique values at worst.\n\nI would argue then than after we have performed the frequency count in a distributed manner there is no need to do the last step which is assigning ordered indices in a distributed manner as well, we can make the assumption that all the (label -> frequency) values should fit into the memory of one machine.\n\nSo I would recommend to gather all data into one partition after getting the counts, that way we guarantee a global ordering:\n\n``` Scala\nfitData.map(s => (s,1))\n      .groupBy(0)\n      .sum(1)\n      .partitionByRange(x => 0)\n      .sortPartition(1, Order.DESCENDING)\n      .zipWithIndex\n      .print()\n```\n\nOf course we would need to clarify this restriction in the docstrings and documentation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260608632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260613716","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2367#issuecomment-260613716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2367","id":260613716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDYxMzcxNg==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-15T11:09:23Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T12:04:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @LordFB \n\nI don't think there is currently a way to do it in cep-flink.

Should we optimize 3 way join? For now the join order is burnt into the code, also we might be able to give hints for join strategies.\n2. How should we handle empty blocks? When matching a rating block with the current factor blocks there might be no rating block or no factor blocks with that id, as the rating block corresponds to differnt user and item block at every iteration. For now we do the join between the blocks with a `coGroup`, and do basically a full-outer-join, because we need to change the rating block ID for every factor block at each iteration. This might not be the most optimal solution (see comments at `coGroup`), but I don't see a better one right now.\n3. The number of blocks determine also the number of iterations. Therefore the higher number of blocks degrade the performance. We conducted experiments on a cluster that shows this:\n   see [plot for movielens data](https://s18.postimg.org/txap3x9o9/movielens_blocks.png) and [for lfm_1b data](https://s11.postimg.org/ysnonuer7/lfm1b_blocks.png). Based on this we would recommend setting the number of blocks to the smallest possible that can fit into memory (and at least the parallelism of the execution). There might be some way to avoid this and break the computation to more blocks while doing the same amount of iteration, but it's not trivial because of the possibly conflicting user-item blocks (and why the paper uses this blocking in the first-place). Should we investigate this further? With the recommended settings (and given enough memory) the algorithm performs well (see the plots).\n4. The testing data is made by hand to ensure changes to the code does not change the algorithm. The algorithm produces good results on real data. The question is whether we should make a more thorough testing mechanism for matrix factorization (as proposed in the [PR for iALS](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2542)) or is this kind of testing sufficient?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260969994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/260978795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2789#issuecomment-260978795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2789","id":260978795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDk3ODc5NQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-16T15:41:21Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T15:41:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would actually like to not change how/when `handover.close()` is called.
