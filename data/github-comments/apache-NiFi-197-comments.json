@ChrisSamo632 @r-vandenbos I do think we want to be careful here. Breaking it up into two processors that really do essentially the same thing is probably a mistake in my opinion. I think it makes much more sense to have a single processor and let a property determine whether or not it's expecting multiple JSON documents. We'd also want to avoid any mention of a \"JSON Record\" - the entire point of Records is that it doesn't matter whether the bytes are in JSON, XML, Logs/plaintext, Avro, etc. They are records.\r\n\r\nIt would definitely make sense to me to take the approach that Chris pointed out - to have two relationships - valid and invalid, where each individual JSON element is routed to one or the other. So each incoming FlowFile would be split into, at most, 2 FlowFiles. This would be consistent with how ValidateRecord works.\r\n\r\nJolt is broken into two different processors because JoltTransformJSON was created before NiFi had a notion of records. So then we created JoltTransformRecord in order to allow the same JOLT language to be used for Avro, XML, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1743139339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1743210311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7782#issuecomment-1743210311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7782","id":1743210311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5n50dH","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-02T15:15:10Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T15:15:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"since i was asked i'll just state I don't have any special input here worth sharing.

I think placing it next to the \"Apply\" button is too disjointed; it makes more sense to keep the checkbox next to the item to which it applies.\r\n\r\n@exceptionfactory There is an \"Apply\" button on both the General and Comments tab. Did your comment of \"always visible\" mean you wanted to see it on the Controller Services tab as well. I think it is not necessary on that tab. Sure, maybe it's a little inconsistent, but there are no changes that need to be applied on the Controller Services tab; it would serve no functional purpose.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem may be that the \"Apply\" button on a Process Group configuration dialog does not dismiss the dialog. It remains present. I have always found that behavior a little odd. I prefer to keep any changes to that as a separate ticket though; I'm not sure if there is a driving reason the dialog should not be dismissed and such a change should be commented on separately, IMO.

I should add I am not particularly convicted on the byte[]/buffer stuff.  Just seems like an opportunity to avoid intermediate copies.  My mental model is this stuff could be in some cases fairly high rate and thus we want to be as efficient as we can.  I didn't comment on the one related to decompression but it too seemed to be subject to some improvements.  I looked at what we're doing in other areas such as this and we have byte[] usage but less so are we jumping between byte buffers to then new byte[] etc..  Ultimately it probably isn't worth looking into now but if we see high utilization and profiling suggests we can do better then we deal with it then.\r\n\r\nThe error I noted and stack trace above I could not get to happen again during testing last night.  It suggests some funky state can be entered but I'm not sure of the nature of it.

for the testing and feedback @joewitt! After reviewing the request content buffering and the available Netty Handlers, I consolidated the HTTP processing to work with the Netty [FullHttpRequest](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/codec/http/FullHttpRequest.html) for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. This streamlined the implementation in `HttpRequestHandler`, avoiding the previous buffer handling issue that resulted in the OutOfMemoryError.\r\n\r\nFollowing these changes, running a continuous stream of JSON files through `InvokeHTTP` did not produce any errors. Heap and non-heap memory usage also followed a consistent pattern.\r\n\r\nAs part of streamlining the handler pipeline, I added a 10 MB maximum content length limitation. Various service providers set request limits for OpenTelemetry payloads to 4 MB or 5 MB. This could be changed to a configurable property, but larger sizes also introduce potential memory usage concerns. Along similar lines, the default Queue Capacity is now 1000 and the default Batch Size is now 100, also limiting potential memory issues in the default configuration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1746013182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1746025606","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7830#issuecomment-1746025606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7830","id":1746025606,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5oEjyG","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T02:17:29Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T02:17:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All looks good.

I agree, I think the stability is significantly improved. @exceptionfactory I think the logging is helpful. I considered changing much of it to DEBUG.

The Process Group dialog used to be similar to other dialogs in terms of size and input field placement. However, when we introduced fine grain access controls we also added support for Process Group scoped Controller Services. Previous to that there was only a single collection of Controller Services that were available for all components. Because we introduced Process Group scoped Controller Services, we duplicated this table in the Process Group dialog. The previous size of the dialog didn't accommodate the full table and we moved this to a full-screen dialog. \r\n\r\nThis Controller Service table is something that I believe we should probably consider now when it comes to the Comments tab and the Apply button. The Apply button was only on the General tab because changes to the Controller Services are not saved when the user presses Apply. They are saved as the user Adds, Edits, Enables, Disables, and Deletes the Services directly in the Controller Service tab. This is also why the dialog doesn't close automatically after Applying changes to the General tab as the user may still want/need to make changes on the Controller Service tab. Because of this, I would avoid placing the Apply or Cancel buttons on the Controller Service tab.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would vote for not having a separate Comments tab. While it's nice that there is some alignment with other component configurations, I worry it would leave the Process Group configuration a little confusing. We'd have 3 tabs where only two have an Apply button and pressing the Apply button would save changes made on both but not the other. Leaving the basic behavior in place where there are two tabs, General (with the Apply button) and Controller Services (where changes are saved automatically), would be the least surprising to users and would also eliminate a lot of the scope creep mentioned earlier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1747434037/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1747447208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7591#issuecomment-1747447208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7591","id":1747447208,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5oJ-2o","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T18:44:09Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T18:44:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the additional background and perspective @mcgilman!\r\n\r\nI tend to agree that having a separate tab for the Comments creates more complexity, as I highlighted earlier with the potential confusion related to button visibility and location.

If the YAML implementation does not support the same constraints, then I recommend not including those property descriptors on the YAML Record Reader implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1762354391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1762850896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7665#issuecomment-1762850896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7665","id":1762850896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5pEvhQ","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-14T11:48:16Z","updated_at":"2023-10-14T11:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dan-s1 Just out of (genuine) curiosity, what prompted this feature?
