For most of my clients I want allowAutoTopicCreation = false so I can funnel topic creation through a workflow and have an admin review the request etc.. However I have one client that uses only non-persistent topics and needs allowAutoTopicCreation = true. The way I have accomplished this is using namespace isolation policies to force that one client's namespaces to different brokers with different configurations. Not the best solution IMO but it will allow you to accommodate both use cases in one cluster.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/560462427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/560480210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5735#issuecomment-560480210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5735","id":560480210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDQ4MDIxMA==","user":{"login":"PierreZ","id":2698318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTgzMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2698318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ","html_url":"https://github.com/PierreZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T16:48:44Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T16:48:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Found a naive solution, by creating a [Counter directly on the AbstractTopic class](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/commit/8625db717c021318d65f70b9b19b0c181ebbc64b).
