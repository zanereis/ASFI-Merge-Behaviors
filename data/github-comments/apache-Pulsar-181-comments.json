The main issue is that the API semantics don't match what users expect. If the `negativeAcknowledge` API acts on a single message, then it is a very surprising behavior for all the messages in the batch to be redelivered. If on the other hand the `negativeAcknowledge` API applies to a batch, then the current behavior would be more understandable. I would argue that single-message semantics are much more useful for the user though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570426363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570429495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5844#issuecomment-570429495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5844","id":570429495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDQyOTQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"murong00","id":31875453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODc1NDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31875453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00","html_url":"https://github.com/murong00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murong00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T01:32:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T01:32:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run

@sijie @gmethvin I agree that redelivering batches is OK in most cases. Redelivery of unacked/nacked messages is the exception, not the rule, but when it occurs it should behave in a way that makes sense to the user of the API.\r\n\r\nIt's not that hard for the client to filter out the already acked messages from the batch. It is already keeping track of this so it knows when it can ack the batch back to broker. It's just a matter of using this information to filter received messages.\r\n\r\nThat approach doesn't cover all failure cases (ex if client restarts), but in the case where the application is NACKing a message, it would give reasonable behavior. Plus it will reduce the number of duplicate messages that get sent to the client when using batch messages.\r\n\r\n@zzzming and I are happy to work on a PR for this if everyone agrees this is the right approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570642173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570743967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5969#issuecomment-570743967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5969","id":570743967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc0Mzk2Nw==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T01:17:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T01:17:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh, since it is also related to transaction implementation, Penghui and me are already writing a PIP for this.

Python client 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 require protobuf version 2, (dot version .20 and .22 respectively). Protobuf 2 is no longer brew install-able. \r\n\r\nSince 2.4.1.post1 can work with protobuf 3, these steps would work.\r\n```\r\nbrew install libpulsar\r\nsudo pip install -U --ignore-installed six\r\nsudo pip install pulsar-client==2.4.1.post1\r\n```\r\nProducer and consumer with SSL enabled with our production were tested and I just manually copied the root CA certificate in PEM format to a local file as following.\r\n```\r\ntrust_certs='./ca-certificates.crt'\r\nclient = pulsar.Client(service_url,\r\n                        authentication=pulsar.AuthenticationToken(token),\r\n                        tls_trust_certs_file_path=trust_certs)\r\n```\r\nIt also works on python3 with this command the client and macOS and python version.\r\nMacOS: 10.14.6\r\npip 19.3.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)\r\nPython 3.7.6\r\n```\r\npip3 install pulsar-client==2.4.1.post1\r\n```\r\nI hope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570810024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570816985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5949#issuecomment-570816985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5949","id":570816985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDgxNjk4NQ==","user":{"login":"aahmed-se","id":8009085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se","html_url":"https://github.com/aahmed-se","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T20:25:36Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T20:25:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@merlimat please review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570816985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/570817990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5991#issuecomment-570817990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5991","id":570817990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDgxNzk5MA==","user":{"login":"alphashaw","id":14175735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTc1NzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14175735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw","html_url":"https://github.com/alphashaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphashaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T20:38:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T20:38:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Well I just realized that a call to `Consumer#negativeAcknowledge(MessageId)` does not actually trigger the redelivery mechanism but add the `MessageId` to the list of ids to be redeliver.
