System.currentTimeMillis is reading from a place in shared memory, and incurs little if any overhead.  System.nanoTime on large multi core systems requires coordination between all of the CPUs to sync them and be sure that it can give that guarantee of a monotonically increasing value.  It is not necessarily that expensive but it is not that cheap either.
