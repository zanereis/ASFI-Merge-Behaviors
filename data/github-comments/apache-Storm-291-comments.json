The partitions are passed to the spout executors (\"coordinatorMeta\"), and it is expected that the Emitter filters that list to get the partitions assigned to itself. Please see https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/64e29f365c9b5d3e15b33f33ab64e200345333e4/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/trident/spout/OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor.java#L112.\r\n\r\nDeciding which partitions exist is the responsibility of the Coordinator, but this implementation puts that responsibility in the Emitter, which causes us to have to hack around with e.g. the enum instance or having to drop an emit because the partition is no longer assigned to this task. It will break if the scheduler happens to put the Coordinator in a different worker from any of the Emitter tasks. The Emitter code ends up being confusing, e.g. refreshPartitions does nothing, but logs based on the coordinatorMeta, which may be different from what the spout is actually assigned. I also think we make it easier to maintain OpaquePartitionedTridentSpoutExecutor if we don't have to keep in mind that the Kafka spout doesn't implement the API in the expected way.\r\n\r\nWe already have the clean separation we need to implement the API as specified, but they're conflated in the Subscription interface.  The Coordinator should use PartitionFilter and its own KafkaConsumer instance (which we should add) to get the list of batch partitions instead of asking the KafkaTridentSpoutManager, so we get a nice decoupling from the Emitter. We should put the refresh subscription timer in the Coordinator as well. The Emitter should receive these partitions in getPartitionsForTask, use ManualPartitioner to decide which partitions are assigned to the task, and assign them on the consumer. \r\n\r\nWe'd need to change either KafkaSpoutConfig or Subscription a bit so we can get at the partitioner and filter classes, but I think it should be doable.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related: I noticed that OpaquePartitionedSpoutExecutor was changed in https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1995 to fix this spout. It might be good to deprecate the getOrderedPartitions/refreshPartitions methods in 1.x so we can remove them from master. Right now the functionality seems duplicated on the Emitter interface, since getPartitionsForTask has the same purpose.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/321623377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/321623848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2271#issuecomment-321623848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2271","id":321623848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTYyMzg0OA==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-10T17:45:25Z","updated_at":"2017-08-10T17:45:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hmcl See my comment on that PR, I think the fixes are not related, but if we make the suggested changes we'll probably need to update this too.

Once the spout executor receives either an ack or a fail for a tuple, any further acks or fails are discarded.</li>\n\t<li>The spout disregards acks or fails for messages that are not in the emitted list. We remove message ids from emitted whenever we ack or fail a tuple, so we're effectively ensuring the same thing as the executor in the spout code as well. If partitions get reassigned, the emitted list for revoked partitions is emptied out, so we won't care about acks/fails for partitions that are not assigned to this spout.</li>\n\t<li>We don't remove pending retries for messages when that message id is acked. I can't come up with a way for a tuple to be acked while the same message id is in the retry service though.</li>\n\t<li>The spout won't emit a tuple for a message id that is already emitted, or is currently in the set of acked tuples. It is possible the spout will emit a tuple for a committed offset, since we don't check for that. This requires the tuple to somehow be in RetryService while it is also acked.</li>\n\t<li>The default RetryService won't duplicate retry schedules, so an offset can't have multiple retries scheduled at the same time. We remove the scheduled retry before emitting a message, so I don't see how it is possible to have a pending tuple while the same message is scheduled on the retry service.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>So as far as I can tell, it should not be possible that RetryService replays tuples that are already acked, and if a tuple gets acked, any subsequent ack/fail calls should not have any effect, unless the spout emits the tuple again after this happens.</p>\n\n<p>I agree that the spout code can't currently handle a tuple being acked and then replayed later, but I'm having trouble understanding how we can get into that situation. We could maybe get rid of some assumptions by making the spout remove scheduled retries once an ack is received, or dropping tuples if we're trying to emit something lower than the committed offset, but I can't really spout the faulty assumption I must be making, because in my mind those changes should not be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Can you share the storm-kafka-client forked code you're running on?<br/>\nAre you using the default retry service?<br/>\nCan you share your Kafka spout configuration?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613029451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613029453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6448#issuecomment-2613029453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6448","id":2613029453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMjk0NTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-13T01:40:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:19:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=guangdu\">guangdu</a>:</i>\n<p>Thank you very much <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> for your time investigating into this.

Just to be sure I'm looking at the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>Are you using Kafka's topic compaction, and do you ever see this log <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/internal/OffsetManager.java#L94\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/external/storm-kafka-client/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/internal/OffsetManager.java#L94</a></p>\n\n<p>Just to explain why I think Storm doesn't ack/fail the same tuple more than once:<br/>\nWhen the spout emits a tuple, it is assigned a random id used for tracking whether the tuple tree has completed. This happens here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/executor.clj#L565\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/executor.clj#L565</a>, and is stored in a map id -> tuple info called \"pending\", where tuple info includes the msg id used by the spout internally. The store into the map is here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/executor.clj#L582\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/executor.clj#L582</a>. <br/>\nWhen the spout receives an ack or fail from the acker bolt, it removes the id -> tuple info mapping from the pending map. It checks that there was such a mapping, and if there were it will call either ack or fail on the spout instance. If the mapping isn't there, the message is ignored. This happens here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/executor.clj#L528\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.1.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/executor.clj#L528</a> and in the line below that.</p>\n\n<p>Given this mechanism, I think it isn't possible for Storm to call ack or fail multiple times for the same tuple, because any ack or fail after the first one is ignored. The reason we do a similar check in the Kafka spout code has to do with partition reassignment. If the spout emits msgId 0 on partition 0 and partition 0 gets assigned to some other spout instance, the spout will throw away its internal state relating to partition 0, including which message ids it thinks it emitted on that partition. If partition 0 then gets assigned back to this spout instance, it might receive the ack or fail for the tuple that was emitted before partitions were reassigned. Since the pending map in the generic Storm code still contains tracking information for that tuple, the spout must be able to handle this ack or fail. We do this by keeping the list of msg ids the spout has emitted, and if we receive an ack or fail for a tuple the spout doesn't think it emitted, we just ignore it. </p>\n\n<p>This should be enough to ensure that we can't receive double acks or fails. The generic mechanism in Storm ensures that we can't get duplicates for the same tuple, while the mechanism in the Kafka spout ensures that if we receive an ack or fail for a message id (which can be duplicated when partition reassignment occurs), we ignore everything except the first one.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a look at the scenario you describe, I agree that some tuples may time out in the shell bolt queue. They will then fail on the spout, and be added to the retry service. Once this happens the tuple ids generated by Storm for those tuples have been removed from the pending map. So if an ack/fail for the same tuple tree is received, it should be dropped before even reaching the spout. If partition reassignment happens, you could get some message id duplication, but when the message id was failed and added to the retry service, it was removed from the emitted set inside the spout. This means any more acks/fails are ignored.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613029456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613029459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6448#issuecomment-2613029459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6448","id":2613029459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMjk0NTk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-13T08:44:48Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:19:04Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srdo\">srdo</a>:</i>\n<p>By the way when you saw logs like </p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">2017-07-27 22:23:49.203 o.a.s.k.s.i.OffsetManager <span class=\"code-object\">Thread</span>-23-spout-executor[248 248] [WARN] topic-partition [kafka_bd_trigger_action-18] has unexpected offset [16002].

I think I've figured out what's happening. The consumer position can sometimes fall behind the committed offsets.</p>\n\n<p>Say there are partition 0 - 10, and this spout is assigned partition 0, and has currently committed up to offset 0.<br/>\nEmit offset 0-100<br/>\nAck offset 0-100, except offset 50<br/>\nReassign partitions before commit happens. Keep partition 0 assigned to this spout.<br/>\nReassignment logic does not remove the offset manager for partition 0, so 0-49 and 51-100 are still acked.<br/>\nReassignment logic seeks the consumer back to the committed offset for all assigned partitions, including partition 0. The consumer position for partition 0 is now 0.<br/>\nAck offset 50<br/>\nNextTuple is called, and commit of offset 0-100 happens.<br/>\nOffsets 0 - 100 are emitted again, because the consumer position was 0. The spout is now in a bad state, and when 0-100 are acked, the offset manager will complain in the log.</p>\n\n<p>A similar scenario can be constructed without partition reassignment</p>\n\n<p>Say max poll records is 10<br/>\nEmit offset 0-100 over 10 polls<br/>\nAck 1-100<br/>\nFail 0 and retry<br/>\nAck 0<br/>\nWhen nextTuple is called, 0-100 will be acked, but the consumer position will be at most 10 due to max.poll.records. Once the offsets are committed, the spout is again in a state where the consumer position is behind the committed offset, and the same problem occurs.</p>\n\n<p>I think the following changes will fix it:<br/>\nDon't seek to committed offsets for partitions during reassignment if they were assigned to the spout previously. This fix isn't strictly necessary, but I don't think it makes sense to seek when we keep the rest of the state.<br/>\nWhen committing offsets, we should check the consumer position. If the position is behind the committed offset, seek up to the committed offset.</p>\n\n<p>Your configuration sets max.poll.records to 4, so I suspect this might be the case you're seeing.</p>\n\n<p>I've put up a branch with proposed fixes here <a href=\"https://github.com/srdo/storm/tree/STORM-2666\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/srdo/storm/tree/STORM-2666</a> (the last commit only, the others are from <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2549\" title=\"The fix for STORM-2343 is incomplete, and the spout can still get stuck on failed tuples\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-2549\"><del>STORM-2549</del></a> which you should already have).

These are not final, as I have not done any tuning yet.  But let me explain the test.  I really wanted to get a handle on how this would impact me, yes I am very selfish that way.  I have been wanting for a long time to be able to write a tool that could simulate this, but it was never high enough up on my priority list to make it happen until now.  Thanks for the nudge to do this by the way.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a [tool](https://github.com/revans2/incubator-storm/tree/STORM-2306-with-loadgen/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/loadgen) and will do a formal pull request after some more features, cleanup, and moving it into its own stand-alone package.\r\n\r\nThe tool will capture a snapshot of topologies running on a cluster.  It grabs the bolts, spouts, and all of the streams connecting them along with metrics for those streams.  The metrics include the output rate and the process/execute latency for each incoming stream.\r\n\r\nI can then simulate the throughput for each stream and the latency for each bolt (I use a Gaussian distribution that matches the measured distribution).\r\n\r\nFor this particular test I captured 104 topologies from a single production cluster 600+ nodes with 19k+ CPU cores and about 70 TB of memory.  The nodes are heterogeneous and the cluster + all of the topologies are tuned for the Resource Aware Scheduler. (I really want to release these captured metrics, but I need to fight with legal to get approval to do it first).  It is a mix of trident and regular storm topologies.  Some with very high throughput (850k/sec in the highest case) and some very low throughput ones.  I then set up another much smaller cluster 9 nodes (1 for nimbus + ZK, 8 for supervisors).\r\n\r\n```\r\nProcessors:\t2 x Xeon E5-2430 2.20GHz, 7.2GT QPI (HT enabled, 12 cores, 24 threads) - Sandy Bridge-EP C2, 64-bit, 6-core, 32nm, L3: 15MB\r\nMemory:\t\t46.7GB / 48GB 1600MHz DDR3 == 6 x 8GB - 8GB PC3-12800 Samsung DDR3-1600 ECC Registered CL11 4Rx4\r\nRHEL 6.7\r\njava 1.8.0_131-b11\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was a non RAS cluster.  The only settings I changed for the cluster were the location of nimbus and zookeeper.\r\n\r\nI then replayed each of the topologies one at a time with default settings + `-c topology.worker.max.heap.size.mb=5500 -c nimbus.thrift.max_buffer_size=10485760`.  (Takes almost 9 hours because each test runs for about 5 mins to be sure that the cluster has stabilized)\r\n\r\nThe first changed setting is because I had a few issues with nimbus rejecting some topologies because they had some RAS settings for a very large cluster and the default settings in storm did not allow them to run.  The second one is because on a few very large topologies the client was rejecting results from nimbus because the thrift metrics were too large (1MB is the default cutoff).\r\n\r\nOf these 104 topologies 95 of them ran on 2.x-SNAPSHOT without any real issues and were able to keep up with the throughput.  For STORM-2306 94 of them ran without any issues and were able to keep up with the throughput.  I have not debugged yet the one topology that would just stop processing on STORM-2306 but was running fine on 2.x-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nFrom those I measured the latency and CPU/Memory used (just like with ThroughputVsLatency).  My goal was to see how these changed from one version of storm to another and get an idea of how much pain out of the box it would be for me and my customers to start moving to it, again my own selfishness here in action.  As I said I have not tuned any of the topologies yet.  I plan on doing that next to see if I can improve some of the measurements.  Here are my results.  As a note for COST I used 1 core equal to 2 GB of memory because that is the ratio we bought hardware at originally (but not so much any more).\r\n\r\n\r\n  | CPU Summary | Memory Summary | Cost Summary | Avg Latency Diff ms (weighted by throughput)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nMeasured Diff | about 250 more needed | about 27 GB less needed | 235 more needed | 5.22 ms more per tuple\r\nIn Cluster Total | about 19k cores | about 70TB | about 55k |  \r\nPercent diff of cluster total | 1.28% | -0.04% | 0.43% |  \r\nIn Cluster Assigned | about 13k cores | about 50TB | about 40k |  \r\nPercent of Assigned | 1.92% | -0.05% | 0.61% |  \r\nAmount Per Node | 47 | about 200GB|   |  \r\nChange (Nodes) | 6 | -0 |   |  \r\n\r\nAs I said I have not tuned anything yet.  I need to because the assumption here is that users will need to tune their topologies for higher throughput jobs.  I don't like that because it adds to the pain for my users, but I will try to quantify that in some way.\r\n\r\nAs it stands now things don't look good for STORM-2306 (and I know running a test that no one else can reproduce is really crappy, but hopefully others can take my tool and play around with their own topologies).\r\n\r\nOn average each tuple is 5 ms slower with STORM-2306, although most of that came from the one really big topology with 850k/sec where STORM-2306 was 30 ms slower.  On average though 5 ms or 30 ms is not a big deal, and I would consider them more or less equal.\r\n\r\nFor resource usage though we start to run into something that is more significant. Memory usage went down by about 27GB, but CPU usage went up by about 250 cores.  This means my currently running topologies would need approximately 6 more servers to be able to handle the same load that they have now. Or just under a 2% increase in cluster usage.  It is small enough that for most topologies they might just be able to absorb it without  any changes, and hopefully with some tuning we can make it smaller.\r\n\r\nMy next steps are to take a sample of the topologies and tune them on both systems to see how much I can reduce the cost, but still maintain the throughput, and not increase the latency by too much.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/322790394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613003002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6276#issuecomment-2613003002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6276","id":2613003002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMDMwMDI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-16T15:48:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:05:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hmclouro\">hmclouro</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> I understand that.
