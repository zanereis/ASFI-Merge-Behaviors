I've read the reference. There are two kinds of generators in the leaf. One is leaf-segment and another is leaf-snowflake. I'd like to start with leaf-segment. The leaf-segment algorithm needs a third component to recode the latest id segment. The third component could be a database or zookeeper. I prefer to choose zookeeper to recode the latest id segment. Because, if id segments stored in a database, a conflit may happen when the table name of id segment is the same as another table of service. Another reason for using zookeeper, is that the zookeeper is necessary for leaf-snowflake.

me?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/485046447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/485092316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/2238#issuecomment-485092316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2238","id":485092316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTA5MjMxNg==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T10:59:32Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T10:59:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##
