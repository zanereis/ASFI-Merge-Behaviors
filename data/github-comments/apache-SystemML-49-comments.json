I think we should either make a blacklist of packages to not download/copy or let mvn create use a collection of exactly those packages that we need, in either case it is necessary to figure out which package are needed.\r\n> > Also setting up java is a single command (we should actually force java 8 execution, which we don't do atm jus `java ...` right?).\r\n> \r\n> We need to move forward towards java 11. but not for this release: Hadoop 3.x and Spark 3.x use/support Java 11.\r\n> https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/\r\n> https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0/\r\n\r\nThen let's keep it as it is for now","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/661812989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/661855002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/997#issuecomment-661855002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/997","id":661855002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MTg1NTAwMg==","user":{"login":"j143","id":53068787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDY4Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53068787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143","html_url":"https://github.com/j143","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-21T13:16:20Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T13:16:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/661855002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/661874627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/980#issuecomment-661874627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/980","id":661874627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MTg3NDYyNw==","user":{"login":"kev-inn","id":41760497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzYwNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41760497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn","html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-21T13:52:05Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T13:52:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What exactly was changed by this?

Are they safe to delete?\r\n\r\nThey should all be safe to delete, all of them are customization of where to log information to. I much prefer the simplicity and control of this simplification. The downside (in my opinion not so much) it is not leveraging some of the \"fancy features of log4j\", for instance you can split up different logging to different outputs such as saying Hadoop should log to `x.log` while spark to `y.log`.\r\n\r\nThe one difference that could be debated is the security logging (from hadoop only nothing with out system) that is customized in the old settings, to log to the Hadoop security log.\r\n\r\n> I am also in favor of deleting of the template files.\r\n\r\nHistoric reason for the template files seems to be that a user downloading the system would copy these into real files, that they could then customize for their own settings while being git ignored. Also the release scripts seems to refer to these template files, to copy them into a release as the official settings. \r\n\r\nI think for simplicity in reproducing settings for each user all should share the same settings file, and we therefore remove the template files.

Just for the historical background: we actually created this log4j file as a copy from the hadoop log4j file (that's were the detailed hadoop configurations came from) and we kept INFO for SystemML by default, because all our messages went through logging (instead of stdout) in order to avoid filling up the stdout queue if nobody is reading from it. Meanwhile, most of our explain (including runtime explain), stats, etc go to stdout so this change is fine. However, I just double checked and a number of warnings/errors (e.g., of the parser - index identifier, parfor stats, codegen explani) go to LOG.info and thus will be silent by default. Let's clean these places up to put all errors/warnings into error level and explain/stats consistently to stdout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/663902905/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/663911394","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/984#issuecomment-663911394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/984","id":663911394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzkxMTM5NA==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-25T22:14:10Z","updated_at":"2020-07-25T22:15:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the initiative @Baunsgaard. Some of these changes are very good, on others I'm kind of split. I would recommend we merge it in (with the changes I made) and see how it works out - if it doesn't we change the defaults accordingly.\r\n\r\n* Logging: I changed some of the logging, especially in `VariableCPInstruction` (which makes a substantial portion of all execution instructions) to guard any logging of concatenated messages behind `if( LOG.isDebugEnabled() )`. Yes, the `LOG.debug` would discard the message, but cannot (without inlining) avoid the string concatenation. With scalar and small-matrix operations this logging would add significant overhead.\r\n\r\n* Test Output Buffering: The new output buffering is useful for some scripts that want to check the output. However, for scripts with large output, this poses a scalability bottleneck (collect all output instead of streaming print & discard), developers have to wait for the output until a test finishes, and we might not see certain problems during development (e.g., remaining development debug output). I now added a method `setOutputBuffering(false)` to disable this output buffering. We go with your new default and let people disable it during development. If this does not work for the team, we simply change the default.\r\n\r\n* Rewrite Errors: The constant folding rewrite (applied on compilation and dynamic recompilation during runtime) has been change from reporting errors and continuing execution to a hard crash. Meanwhile this is fine as these rewrites are stable enough and our exceptions have been changed to subclassing `RuntimeException`, so we can leave it like that. \r\n\r\n* Error Handling: Stop and parser issues were on purpose not reported as exceptions but reported in a more user-friendly manner. Now, that we propagate everything as exceptions, a run from command line would throw potentially very deep stacktraces for these. I'm not sure this is a good idea as it simplifies development and testing at the expense of our users. Again, let's give it a try - if it turns out to be unacceptable, we change it to two slightly different entry points for tests and command line invocations. \r\n\r\n* Minor Issues: Furthermore, I removed some unnecessary imports, changed instance methods to static methods where possible, and replaced some loops with more succinct lambda expressions. Regarding formatting, please avoid `} else`.

Sorry for the delay, I think it was about time to merge this in as the PR already started diverging from main. I resolved the conflicts, fixed some minor unnecessary imports, fixed the already changed federated L2SVM cmd parameters, and removed unnecessary uses of parallel streams (we try to avoid that for tiny collections because the performance impact is negative, and there is a danger of deadlocks if the surrounding code already uses the common fork-join pool). Furthermore, I reduce the datasizes in the tests such that the test time for the privacy package came down from 2500s to 170s on my laptop. \r\n\r\nHowever, I also had to disable the L2SVM and individual operation tests as they were failing with privacy exceptions. Once you're back, let's look over them and see what changed are necessary wrt the rework of the federated backend.

I only made some minor modifications related to parser error handling (only frame-frame supported), the integration as `binaryOperations` (to make it consistent with matrix blocks), modified CP/Spark instructions to fix systematic typos (\"comparision\") and avoid unnecessary code redundancy, fixed the handling of RDD/broadcast dependencies (to avoid too eager cleanup), and fixed the formatting of tests (position of java annotations).\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent PR, please first run an experiment to measure runtime performance. Then, reimplement the frame block comparison operation to directly allocate and update `BooleanArray`s instead over going through the indirection of string arrays. This has the advantage of avoiding allocation, avoiding unnecessary string serialization and parsing, and avoiding cache-unfriendly operations (row vs column layout). Finally, measure the resulting performance improvement (e.g., for 100 binary frame comparisons at script level).

You could even write \"Apache SystemDS\" smile\r\n\r\nYou need to install systemds python if you want to run it.\r\ntherefore i refer to the install guide that has to be run first.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/697257377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/697270429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/924#issuecomment-697270429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/924","id":697270429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NzI3MDQyOQ==","user":{"login":"corepointer","id":49227510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49227510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer","html_url":"https://github.com/corepointer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corepointer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-23T10:14:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T10:14:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @corepointer - Thanks a lot for working on this! smiley\r\n> \r\n> **Few more ingredients:** salt\r\n> \r\n>     1.
