Find `CollectorBootStartUp#main` also in `apm-collector-boot` module, and startup.\r\n1. Follow [build document](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/How-to-build.md#build-from-github) to package the source codes in this branch.\r\n1. Find release in `dist` folder and enter `bin` folder to start up webapp by `webappService.sh`.\r\n1. Access the Sleuth example. \r\n\r\nRight now, I use Caffeine as an expire checker, and it doesn't work well. So just ignore the following errors. Just access Spring Sleuth more than once.

Zookeeper is for collector cluster to detect each other. So agent don't need it. Collectors in cluster mode share the same zookeeper and elasticsearch cluster.\r\n1. Agent always need some IPs and hosts to connect collector, right? What do you prefer to use? The IPs or hosts in your settings could be considered as service discovery service provided in cluster, agent uses this to query the real collector cluster IPs, and pick one in random. In agent settings, you could set more than one IP or hostname. Even use zookeeper in agent(of course we don't), you need the whole IPs of zookeeper. So there is no difference between set the collector IPs and set zookeeper IPs. In underlying, that is same service discovery mechanism.\r\n1. I don't understand what is your meaning about central apm infra. APM backends need to collect, aggregate and analysis data, so, definitely they should run in a cluster. In any way, they must run a whole cluster. You can deploy collector in each VM and sharing the  same Zookeeper and elasticsearch, but I don't recommend that.\r\n\r\nHope this can help you to understand better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/397913746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/397913846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1364#issuecomment-397913846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1364","id":397913846,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzkxMzg0Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-17T23:33:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-17T23:33:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You don't need to reboot agent to get new collector address, the collector naming service provided at the endpoint of you agent settings addresses.

I am getting a good feel about how these components can discover themselves and form the quorum. This is perfect.\r\n\r\nHowever the common problem that we have come across in our AWS VPC is that every hosted component is ephemeral in nature. They don't retain any state and in case of redeployments or failover they tend to come up as a new host, including new IP's. Now when we deploy the APM modules they are bound to have the same ephemeral nature. In case of a tear down/infra rebuild, due from datacenter failover, maintenance or upgrades, in some cases new hosts for Zk, Collector etc will be created and they are bound to have brand new IP's assigned.\r\n\r\nNow all of a sudden the 100 odd skywalking java agents are going to freak out as there is no known Collectors available. Cant discover either as IP's of all Collectors have changed. At this point I don't see any other way than restart all my 100 applications (use puppet or ansiable) so that they register the new Collector IP's in the agent.conf.\r\n\r\nIf only we had a light weight stateless collector agent on each of these application hosts, they could have been restarted instead and the application is always configured to talk to this local collector agent.
