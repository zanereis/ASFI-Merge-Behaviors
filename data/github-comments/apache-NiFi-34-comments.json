not sure why GitHub doesn't show but this PR drifted from the master in the sense we no longer specify the hadoop version within the child pom.xml\n\nAlso, while I am not an expert, I am a bit worried

profiles to see if this causes any issues?\n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/251263230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/251304571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1091#issuecomment-251304571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1091","id":251304571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTMwNDU3MQ==","user":{"login":"combineads","id":3220939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjA5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads","html_url":"https://github.com/combineads","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/combineads/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-04T06:31:49Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T06:31:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello,

Ideally I believe this processor should allow use to chose between content replacement (replace the original log line with the json representation) and adding attributes (what you already did). This should give an idea of what I mean: https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/785\n3. Please don't hard-code the patterns, instead, let the user configure the pattern files\n4. The java-grok version has some bugs, you may want to upgrade it (this is the reason I haven't submitted the code previously... :smiley: )\n\nThank you again, looking forward your modifications\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/251817805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/251846149","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1081#issuecomment-251846149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1081","id":251846149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTg0NjE0OQ==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T01:37:16Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T01:37:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 thanks for the code. \n\nLGTM.\n\nWill merge later today against master and check if I can apply against 0.x as well.\n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/251846149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/251848652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1092#issuecomment-251848652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1092","id":251848652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTg0ODY1Mg==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T01:58:23Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T01:58:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@michalklempa build seems ok on travis.

The KMS feature is still in, merged with your implementation of S3V4 [using SetSignerOverride() ]. \n\n[edit]\nAll points you've mentioned are either solved (SetSignerOverride and AWS SDK update) or not relevant anymore (Fetchs3Object)\n[/edit]\n\nFurthermore we've included a new processor! It's the Kinesis Streams processor, basically the streaming version of firehose. Hope you like it :)\n\nWill check Jira and update accordingly.

Kinesis is the Umbrella, which currently contains three services: Firehose, Streams and Analytics. This processor block only works for Kinesis Streams, Please rename both code and PR/Jira :) (+ also the tests under a subfolder 'streams')\n- The API explains some restrictions to PutRecords(): \n\n> Each PutRecords request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1 MB, up to a limit of 5 MB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second.[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html] \n\nData needs to be chunked into multiple PutRecords calls if the amount of records > 500. We used the following:\n`List<PutRecordBatchResponseEntry> recordChuncks = Lists.partition(records, 500);`\nIf you'd like to it really properly, also check on 5 MB batch limit size and record size of 1 MB.\n- We added a NR_SHARDS parameter for the sake of resharding (scaling up/down) in the future. Although we didn't implement a resharding mechanism, it's perhaps worth considering.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/252849671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/252976097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-252976097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":252976097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjk3NjA5Nw==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T16:52:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T16:52:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jvwing, @miquillo , @simplesteph - Thanks for your feedback and comments.  \n\nI've updated to code with the following:\n1. Moved tests to stream package\n2. Added displayName and name to properties\n3. Changed logging level for successful flow files to debug (to reduce logging output)\n4. Added comments on stream provisioning for integration tests  - I used 10 shards\n5. Moved creation of runner, setting creds file, and stream name to setup in IT tests.\n\nRegarding logging for successful message processing - I agree that info level logging for all events is a bit verbose.  In the updated code, I've set the level to debug so that user may choose to get details as they deem necessary.  IMHO - it's better to give the user complete logs, with the option to turn it off, rather than a fixed number, which could cause confusion if they are trying to trace their events.  Once, users are satisfied with tracing, they can turn logging level to info to reduce logs.\n\nRegarding logging for failed flow files - IMHO, if we fix the output size of flow files in the logs, it might not give the complete picture to the user.  Most of the errors (I believe) will be resolved during configuration and setup and during runtime, there might be a few errors so there might not be lots of flow files in the logs.\n\nHowever, in case the consensus is to reduce the flowfiles to a fixed number (say 10), in successful or failure cases, let me know and I will work on it.  I was just trying to keep things simple and complete.\n\nRegarding packages and names recommendation - The PutKinesis processor was in stream package but the tests were not, so I've moved them to stream package.  If the consensus is to rename the put processor to PutKinesisStream, let me know and I will update it.\n\nThanks again for your feedback and let me know your thoughts.\n\nMans\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/252976097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/252989360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-252989360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":252989360,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjk4OTM2MA==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T17:39:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T17:39:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@miquillo, would you please expand on your comment on Kinesis Stream limits?  I believe the code so far respects the batch limits for both records and bytes.  The BATCH_SIZE property is validated for 1-500 records (default 250) and flowfiles are pulled from the inbound queues only up to the maximum number of records and (approximately) the maximum bytes from MAX_MESSAGE_BUFFER_SIZE_MB.\n\nIt's true this processor does NOT throttle the total throughput per second, but that can be achieved with an upstream ControlRate processor or by scheduling PutKinesis itself.  I don't think we need to address it beyond capturing the error messages (we do).  The defaults seem sensible for most users.\n\nDo you agree?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/252989360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/253007375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-253007375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":253007375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzAwNzM3NQ==","user":{"login":"jvwing","id":3151078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTEwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing","html_url":"https://github.com/jvwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T18:44:02Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T18:44:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mans2singh thanks for the displayName, namespace, and test doc changes.\n- **Logging** - I'm mostly comfortable with the logging as-is, I certainly agree with your point about most problems being up-front configuration.  Would it be OK to move the exception message before the listing of the flowfiles (PutKinesis.java:168)?  I think it would be easier to understand problems in bulletins on the processor, while still leaving the flowfile detail.\n- **Naming** - Changing the naming does seem appropriate, to mirror what you have already done with Kinesis Firehose.
