I think I should have been clearer since we use \"parser\" for both the antlr parser (the syntactic parser) and the language processing in the package parser (the semantic parser). For the simple \"modify the parser\" approach I mentioned earlier, I don't think we need changes to the antlr parser at all.\r\n\r\nIn detail, your dml is parsed into statement blocks and statements. Statements such as the AssignmentStatement (for X = ...) have an arbitrary expression on the right hand side. Function calls are represented as FunctionCallIdentifier, which is also an expression. However, in contrast to normal expressions, we currently require that the FunctionCallIdentifier is the right hand side of the assignment statement. So the splitting would essentially take an assignment statement such as X = Y + foo() and split it into TMP_hash = foo(); and X = Y + TMP_hash. For the creation of unique temporary variable names, you can probably reuse the existing primitives we currently use for inlining.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/367250165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/368202493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/732#issuecomment-368202493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/732","id":368202493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODIwMjQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-24T05:46:05Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T05:46:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That

However, we're very practical here, MCSR is used by default but we explicitly convert/produce CSR whenever this flexibility is not needed.\r\n\r\n[1] http://boss.dima.tu-berlin.de/media/BOSS16-Tutorial-mboehm.pdf, slide 21 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/371708974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/371713311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/740#issuecomment-371713311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/740","id":371713311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTcxMzMxMQ==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-09T04:55:03Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T04:55:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM - thanks @EdgarLGB I'll merge this in together with the additional features. \r\n\r\nJust to answer your question: In practice, a lot of scripts depend on dynamic recompilation to adapt runtime plans for initial unknowns or changing sizes (dimensions and sparsity). We compile at the granularity of entire HOP DAGs. Since the output of eval (which calls an unknown function) will in most cases be unknown during initial compilation, all operations with data dependencies on the eval output would fallback to conservative distributed operations. Hence, we want - similar as we do it for data-dependent operators like table or removeEmpty (see `RewriteSplitDagDataDependentOperators`) - cut the DAG after this operator to create a hook for dynamic recompilation. At the same time, we don't want to cut the DAG into too many pieces because this limits rewrite potential - accordingly, the above rewrite tries to find a minimal cut in case there are multiple relevant operators in the same DAG.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/371713311/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/371732795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/738#issuecomment-371732795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/738","id":371732795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTczMjc5NQ==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-09T07:14:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T07:14:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer

again @EdgarLGB for your contribution - it worked like a charm. I further added the support for function name expressions, but removed the support for function calls outside the default namespace for two reasons. First, there were potential conflicts with constant variables, which could have caused incorrect results and runtime failures. Second, the call to namespace functions would still be limited to static names, which could simply be called directly. However, I took a note and will extend that once we cleaned up the entire meta data management of namespaces. Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/371741968/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/371787876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/740#issuecomment-371787876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/740","id":371787876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTc4Nzg3Ng==","user":{"login":"EdgarLGB","id":15153347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUzMzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15153347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB","html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-09T11:28:45Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T11:28:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cool @mboehm7  And if we could support the global constant variables to resolve the conflicts?

no global constants will not solve this issue. Doing namespace resolution by putting the mapping into the data structures used for constant propagation could overwrite constants with the same variable name as the namespace (not that variables can have the same name as namespaces or even builtin functions). \r\n\r\nOriginally, we used the logical names as namespace, but it was later changed to the filenames to address issues with recursive namespace and function resolution. However, down the road (after our SystemML 1.1 release), we should simply maintain this additional meta data in the function directory. Once this is done, we could simply allow namespace functions in eval as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/372086067/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/372087104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/743#issuecomment-372087104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/743","id":372087104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjA4NzEwNA==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-11T03:45:52Z","updated_at":"2018-03-11T03:47:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@j143 thanks for starting work on this but note that you should not change the JMLC configuration. Instead of simply enabling dynamic recompilation (which already allows to use codegen through JMLC), the task is to provide an additional codegen compilation mode that only compiles \"safe\" fused operators which don't need sizes for validity checks. Hence, I would recommend to initially add a configuration to `SpoofCompiler`, and modify the OFMC conditions in `TemplateCell`, `TemplateOuterProduct`, and `TemplateRow` to respect this configuration and only allow candidates that don't rely on sizes (e.g., unary and matrix-scalar operations as well as aggregations).\r\n\r\nBtw, since this would be a deep-cutting change in the codegen compiler, we'll not merge it before the SystemML 1.1 release, i.e., before the RC branch is created.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/372087104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/372545546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/743#issuecomment-372545546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/743","id":372545546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjU0NTU0Ng==","user":{"login":"j143-zz","id":20439730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20439730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/j143-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T04:45:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T04:45:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"w/o

unfortunately not. Most importantly, please ensure that for normal operations not a single aspect of the codegen compilation semantics should change. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, don't focus on individual operations but classes of operations. To do so, think about what the problem is with unkowns. On example are binary operations like A+B+C - normally we would order the inputs according to dimensions and then non-zeros. However, if we order C, A, B and C is a column vector while A and B are matrices, the generated operator would produce incorrect results. Without recompilation we could not correct that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/372784691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/373264205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/699#issuecomment-373264205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/699","id":373264205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzI2NDIwNQ==","user":{"login":"j143-zz","id":20439730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20439730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/j143-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j143-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-15T05:21:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T05:25:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @dusenberrymw , @krishnakalyan3 ,\r\nI ran binary classification script on one of the UCI classification dataset, with the result :`Epoch: 100, Iter: 100, Train Loss: 0.05560625513997489, Train Accuracy: 1.0, Val Loss: 0.05331218854017246, Val Accuracy: 1.0` .
