The current IDE setup steps (https://hudi.incubator.apache.org/newsite-content/contributing) is inconsistent with the style settings present in the repository.\r\n> \r\n> We need to ensure the convention we enforce needs to be auto-settable in IDE (using IDE code-formatting options). For example : in IntelliJ, if we \"Reformat Code\" and \"Optimize Imports\", it should bring the code to a state where checkstyle needs to pass. This is how it used to be with minor caveats. Can we ensure we reach that state.\r\n> \r\n> What we need is :\r\n> \r\n> 1. As spotless relies on eclipse style config, make changes to eclipse style config to make it consistent with current checkstyle setting so that we don't end up with massive change\r\n> 2. Also provide corresponding intellij settings (there are many intellij users here :) ) which is again consistent with eclipse style settings enforced by spotless\r\n> 3. Update https://hudi.incubator.apache.org/newsite-content/contributing to reflect how to set code style.

Seems like it has already happened before?\r\n2. The rules introduced in eclipse-java-google-style.xml are compatible with rules in checkstyle.xml. \r\n3. In my local dev, I use checkstyle plugin and the checkstyle.xml in (https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/tree/master/style), it plays well with spotless plugin(eclipse-java-google-style.xml) and

Could you please help me verify again?\r\nAfter modifying the checkstyle-suppressions.xml in hoodie-0.4.7 (https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/hoodie-0.4.7/style/checkstyle-suppressions.xml) to the following (mainly change the `HoodieLogFileCommand.java` to `.` in indentation checks)\r\n```xml\r\n<suppressions>\r\n  <!-- Impossible to resolve checkstyle indentation violation because of checkstyle bug -->\r\n  <suppress checks=\"indentation\" files=\".\" lines=\"1-9999\"/>\r\n  <!-- Member Names expected to start with \"_\"  -->\r\n  <suppress checks=\"naming\" files=\"TestRecord.java\" lines=\"1-9999\"/>\r\n</suppressions>\r\n```\r\nReformat in IntelliJ and checkstyle.xml would play well together. Also I verify it in lastest master branch, it plays well too. So just modify the suppressions.xml file to get all make sense?\r\n \r\nAs to the documentation, I think we need to document that developers could use checkstyle.xml file in style folder in checkstyle plugin and things will go well since the eclipse-java-google-style.xml is compatible with checkstyle.xml.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/573539453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/573590408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1216#issuecomment-573590408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1216","id":573590408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzU5MDQwOA==","user":{"login":"leesf","id":10128888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTI4ODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10128888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf","html_url":"https://github.com/leesf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leesf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T10:12:24Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T10:12:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for opening the contribution @liujianhuiouc ! would you please change the title and follow the guide https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html#life-of-a-contributor?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/573590408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/573729421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1220#issuecomment-573729421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1220","id":573729421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzcyOTQyMQ==","user":{"login":"hmatu","id":59252744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjUyNzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59252744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu","html_url":"https://github.com/hmatu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmatu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T15:48:31Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T15:48:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If you modify some changes, you can continue to commit to same branch, no need to create a new pr, like https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1219 https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1217 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/573729421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
