When a non-admin user has authorized other resources, when creating a udf function, the UDF resource will display non `.jar` resources\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56599784/148630186-cf3de53b-e696-44f3-bd93-a4c8bfeb624e.png)\r\n2. UDF resource displays correctly when creating user with admin user\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nIt is wrong to display non-.jar resources in UDF resources\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nstep1: Authorize some resources to user a under the administrator user\r\nstep2: Log in with user a, and create or modify UDF functions, UDF resources display non `.jar` resources\n\n### Anything else\n\nDiscovered by looking at the code\r\n\r\nIn the `org.apache.dolphinscheduler.api.service.impl.ResourcesServiceImpl#queryAuthoredResourceList` code, when querying UDF resources, the `t_ds_relation_udfs_user` table is not filtered by type, but the `t_ds_relation_resources_user` table is directly queried\r\n\r\n![图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56599784/148630485-991ebe4d-b818-4526-90b0-156a3b4664fe.png)\r\n\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.1\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [X]
