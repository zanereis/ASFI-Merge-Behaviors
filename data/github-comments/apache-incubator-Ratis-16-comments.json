The firstAvailable will be 0 here.\r\n> \r\n> Should it wait until truncation before sending the notifyInstallSnapshot message?\r\n\r\nI think it no necessary. The original purpose of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RATIS-1390 seems to trigger an immediate snapshot install for a bootstrapped peer. The written prerequisite is ```The leader sends the snapshot only when some or all of the ratis logs have been purged.```  \r\nThe truth is currently it will trigger a snapshot no matter whether the ratis log has been purged.  In my understanding, it's not bad and also makes sense since such a case only happens at the init stage of the cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n> > installing a snapshot to 0 is strange\r\n> Does the snapshot with index 0 contain any information? What about later terms (e.g. `t:5, i:0`)?\r\n> If it's an empty snapshot, should we short-circuit such snapshot by returning e.g. `ALREADY_INSTALLED`?\r\n\r\nNope.\r\nThe first available index received from the ratis side for OM/SCM/Container is not used, only shown in logs as for information and we obtain the DB checkpoint from the leader for the latest one, whose index could be already updated. \r\nFor the ozone side, there won't be any empty snapshots. Even before any data is written in the cluster, a snapshot/checkpoint of RDB is non-empty.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1122035694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1122044025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/644#issuecomment-1122044025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/644","id":1122044025,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5C4Qh5","user":{"login":"adoroszlai","id":6454655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTQ2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6454655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai","html_url":"https://github.com/adoroszlai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-10T07:45:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T07:48:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@szetszwo Ozone CI has selective checks to save time.

Each checkpoint is a complete snapshot of RDB. We don't care about the stale SST files as you mentioned the file ```2``. We keep the checkpoint as a unit to compare, which simplifies the logic.\r\nMaster will compare the latest checkpoint and newly-created checkpoint, and send the incremental part. For the stale SSTs, the follower RDB has a mechanism to deal with them, that is using MANIFEST to detect the stale SSTs and GC them.\r\nBasically, the master only needs to have two checkpoints each time for the notify request, we could choose to delete old checkpoints or not, but only deletes all checkpoints after the ratis server tells us the snapshot is finished.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1138117795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1139340127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/647#issuecomment-1139340127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/647","id":1139340127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5D6PNf","user":{"login":"kaijchen","id":5821159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjExNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5821159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T06:58:10Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T06:58:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for explaining @Xushaohong.
