Yet another win for code reviews.\r\n\r\nI think the best solution to this problem is to introduce a new inaccuracy counter called `deleted`.  There are already a few inaccuracy counters reported when gather summary information.  I will add another comment that shows where these can be found.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought I could circle back and use the file that replaced a missing file.  However this approach has a problem.  Multiple deleted files could have been compacted into the replacement file, and for some of those deleted files we may have already gathered and merged summary information.  Trying to avoid this problem would make gathering summaries more expensive.  In order to keep gathering summaries fast, I think it would be best to just report the problem.  If someone really wants to avoid this problem, they can clone the table and make the request against the clone.  I can put this avoidance strategy in the javadoc for `deleted`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/284457137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/284535535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/228#issuecomment-284535535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/228","id":284535535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDUzNTUzNQ==","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-06T21:18:08Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T21:18:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

When it is heap-ifying each column (termsource), it's saying that for the given `Range` it was seek'ed to, there are no results. However, there is no reason that this instance of the `OrIterator` couldn't be seek'ed to a new `Range` without being torn-down.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of the time, I would guess that the above is not actually triggered (they would get a new instance of the iterator that would re-construct the term sources).\r\n\r\n*edit*: in other words, I think this is meant to be an \"optimization\" to prevent re-seeking a TermSource that we already once knew didn't exist in the current `Range` (during the teardown-reseek case)... if that actually clarifies things (lol).

In fact, it can actually lead to dependency **divergence**. (Explicit version declarations mean greater potential for conflict with inherited transitive deps.) However, it does set us up to understand our real dependencies better, which could help in future, if we pursue convergence.

If I had only changed the ExecutorService calls from `submit()` to `execute()` then this would have enabled the LoggingRunnable (created by the NamingThreadFactory) to log the error.

Here is an answer for the general comments you left outside the code:\r\n\r\n- **I see some pojo classes have @XmlAttribute on the member variables, and others don't? Why the inconsistency (when the name isn't being overridden)?** The @XmlAttribute only shows up on some of the XML tags which have a different name than the attribute, that's why not all of the variables have it. \r\n\r\n- **Might  just be me, but I'd prefer to see consistency on the variable declaration (one per line) and only set an initial value when it doesn't involve instantiating a new object. I don't remember what Accumulo's \"style\" actually says.** I'll look into what the style says, but I agree with you, I think I started doing it for some reason and then kept doing it out of habit, but I can change it to your suggestion if the Accumulo \"style\" agrees.\r\n\r\n- **All of those pojos also leave the member variables public. Can we not encapsulate them and expose them with getters? I am pretty sure that Jackson supports this.** It does, I changed to use the public variables at the suggestion of @ctubbsii, but we could discuss the best approach and change it to that.\r\n\r\n- **Some minor whitespace things. Extra newlines at the start of a method body which are just bloat.\r\nAny cross-browser testing? e.g. FF, Chrome, IE?** I tried using the code templates for Accumulo and running verify, so that might have escaped me.
