The patches cover different business scenarioes, also need much more data, time, different kinds of queries to verify them completely.\r\n\r\nIn one of our production environment, with about thousands of GB data, about 2~3 days, the HiveServer2s were running OOM.\r\nI spent some days to analysis the JVM dumps, compare the information from dumps and logs with the hive PRs, and applied those patches finally. After the patches applied, no OOM found any more.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1665293801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1665433214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1158#issuecomment-1665433214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1158","id":1665433214,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5jRH5-","user":{"login":"liqinwyyx","id":2969606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Njk2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2969606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx","html_url":"https://github.com/liqinwyyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqinwyyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-04T11:05:21Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T11:05:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for your contributing.
