There I had a failing test which I could have just amended but I thought it was probably worth taking a deeper look and do some cleaning up.\r\nWe currently have two separate naming conventions for partition fields which I think is not only a technical debt, but could also be found confusing.\r\nIf you consider the following example:\r\n```\r\n    PartitionSpec initialSpec = PartitionSpec.builderFor(SCHEMA).bucket(\"data\", 8).build();\r\n    TestTables.TestTable table = TestTables.create(tableDir, \"testnames\", SCHEMA, initialSpec, 2);\r\n    table.updateSpec().removeField(bucket(\"data\", 8)).commit();\r\n    table.updateSpec().addField(bucket(\"data\", 8)).commit();\r\n    Partitioning.partitionType(table);\r\n```\r\nWe'd end up with\r\n```\r\nstruct<1000: data_bucket: optional int, 1001: data_bucket_8: optional int>\r\n```\r\nI guess that means that for metadata queries one should specify different column names while they actually mean the same thing? I recall you have also found it weird in a similar case in @aokolnychyi 's example https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3411#discussion_r823186537 where field names didn't match partition names.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand you're right of course, as this clean-up needs change in lots of files. These are mostly test files, but I'd rather be worried about the expected API compatibility / behaviour of PartitionSpec class. But then again, maybe this is something that could be fixed before the first major version is GA?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1142142111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1142202655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4913#issuecomment-1142202655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4913","id":1142202655,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85EFKEf","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-31T14:21:42Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T14:21:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok,

I went for `apache-iceberg` in the PR #[4844](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4844/files#diff-1a45bd938160f7761769e7b6fbc819d1cc7f84ce37f1a6a23ef83cc4e214abc8R19), but that wasn't intentional. I got that from `apache-airflow` on which I also did a lot of work. @jun-he thanks for pointing out the vote, I was unaware of it. Since there weren't any releases (yet), I figured it was TBD.\r\n\r\nI also think that `pyiceberg` is a great pypi package name as it matches the internal name. This will prevent a lot of confusion, and frustration in the end. It also nicely aligns with `pyarrow` and `pyspark`.\r\n\r\nWith respect to dropping the `src`; a big `+1` from my side. It doesn't add any value in my opinion. It will simplify some things such as being able to import the source without having to install it.

Because: \r\n\r\n1.  If there is an existing table which just has included too many manifests (and some of them just have many manifest entries),  then the approaches will just don't work ( such as merging metadata so that those manifest size is an idea size,  tuning the thread size etc).  We can do nothing in the real production environment unless we increment the heap size of spark driver or trino coordinator.   But what if we are not allowed to restart the spark driver & trino coordinator because of the other serving querying jobs ?\r\n\r\n2.  Does the blocking queue approach introduce any substantial performance bottleneck ?  If we think the default blocking queue size is a bit small,  then we can increase this default blocking queue size to 10000.  I think most of the cases won't be effected by the default blocking queue size, unless we have an extremely large table with so many manifest entries. But  in the case it seems to be easily OOM if we don't have any limited queue size.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1144693457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1144718581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4942#issuecomment-1144718581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4942","id":1144718581,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85EOwT1","user":{"login":"sumeetgajjar","id":7351922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar","html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-02T10:47:24Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T10:47:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
