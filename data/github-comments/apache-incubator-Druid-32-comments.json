When the merge process merges segments that don't all cover the same interval, it can faithfully represent what's there in different areas of the timeline. Users would presumably already have some code to handled different queryGranularities on different parts of the timeline, since different segments could have different queryGranularities.\n\n2) don't include queryGranularities, establish an expectation that it's the user's problem.\n\nEven if we do (1) we still have the potential to throw away information (when two segments for the same interval have different granularities) but I think that's ok. If you merge a queryGranularity = HOUR segment with a queryGranularity = DAY segment and the intervals overlap, then the resulting segment really should represent itself as DAY.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/136501284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/136524208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1638#issuecomment-136524208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1638","id":136524208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjUyNDIwOA==","user":{"login":"guobingkun","id":11789051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzg5MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11789051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/guobingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guobingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-31T23:08:39Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T00:01:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done second scan of review comments.

Added another assembly step so that `mysql-metadata-storage` will be packaged in a separate tarball. User can go into `druid_extensions` and untar `mysql-metadata-storage--bin.tar.gz` there.\n3. Modified common runtime properties so that the extension load list still contains `druid-examples`,`druid-kafka-eight`\n4. Removed extension-distribution since it is replaced by extension directoies.\n5. Updated tutorial, firewall and Build From Source docs.\n6. Include hadoop dependencies in the tarball.

I was probably just confused by the names then. In my mind _all_ locks in this PR are \"exclusive\" (in that there will never be two different shared locks for an interval) but some are preemptible and some are not. So IMO \"non-preemptible\" or \"uninterruptible\" is a better word than \"exclusive\".\n\nIt's also kind of confusing that \"canAcquireLock\" actually makes changes to the locks. IMO either that method should not make changes, or it can make changes but then it should have a different name.\n\nFor the context stuff, I don't have a strong preference. I think it's ok to let people set their own priorities. I don't think it's necessary but I think it's ok if we want to go that way. It's also something that could be added later, because tasks could have a default priority that is overridden by the json.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/137539288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/137541054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1604#issuecomment-137541054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1604","id":137541054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNzU0MTA1NA==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-03T18:52:26Z","updated_at":"2015-09-03T18:52:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"bouncing

I took care of your comments. I have a question though, the integration test that I wrote submits 3 Index task with different priorities in order such that only last one with highest priority succeeds as the last one will revoke the tasklocks of first two. However, sometimes after the last task succeeds, ExecutorLifeCycle for one of the first two tasks will start and it calls `isReady` for that task again [here](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/io/druid/indexing/worker/executor/ExecutorLifecycle.java#L120). Thus, the task will acquire the lock again as the last task with highest priority has already succeeded. Do you think it is correct behavior and it can succeed or once the lock for a task is revoked it should always fail ?  \nI was just thinking why there is a call to `isReady` again in ExecutorLifeCyle, wouldn't for all tasks (even in local mode) the taskqueue will ensure that the task is ready before running it using the task runner. There's a comment saying \"Won't hurt in remote mode, and is required for setting up locks in local mode:\" I don't understand why it is required in local mode. What am I missing here ? BTW I removed the `isReady` call in ExecutorLifeCycle and ran it through our CI pipeline (which runs integration test as well) and it passed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/138598073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/138624690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1707#issuecomment-138624690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1707","id":138624690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODYyNDY5MA==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T16:39:15Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T16:39:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No,
