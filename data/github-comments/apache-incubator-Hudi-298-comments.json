In case you have a heterogeneous env where you have both base files in old schema and the new schema you'll be having issues reading such table (see below)\r\n - Heterogeneous table w/ type promotions won't work w/ Parquet when Dictionary Encoding is enabled (requires fixing DE impl in Parquet)\r\n - Heterogeneous table w/ type promotions won't work w/ Spark Vectorized Reader either ([SPARK-40876](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-40876?filter=allopenissues))\r\n\r\nAs such, there's no way this could be reliably supported w/in Hudi currently.

now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1307831723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1308024853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7073#issuecomment-1308024853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7073","id":1308024853,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5N9uAV","user":{"login":"waywtdcc","id":59957056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTU3MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59957056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc","html_url":"https://github.com/waywtdcc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waywtdcc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T00:28:31Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T00:28:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can

the issue is rooted in \r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"--conf spark.hadoop.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL='jdbc:derby:memory:databaseName=metastore_db;create=true'\",  # noqa\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `memory` is set as subsubprotocol, which means it won't persist any data. You should leave it empty like `jdbc:derby:databaseName=metastore_db;create=true` so it will use the default `directory` mode which persists to file system. see https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.14/ref/rrefjdbc37352.html\r\n\r\nAnother note, with the embedded driver only 1 connection can stay open with that database, hence if you run a spark-shell with [sample code like this](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/6508b11d7c1c1e4cb22aac86f9977cd951a91c9b/packaging/bundle-validation/spark_hadoop_mr/write.scala) to perform hive-sync, you'll run into `Another instance of Derby may have already booted the database`. this is the limitation with embedded driver.\r\n\r\nSo it really depends on how you setup the unit tests, embedded driver may work for many simple cases. For functional tests which usually involves some local servers and multiple processes, client driver is needed, and it's much more lightweight than postgres. Let us know if you need more info on setting the client driver.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1310314615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1310351490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7165#issuecomment-1310351490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7165","id":1310351490,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5OGmCC","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T14:19:57Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T14:19:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fangzai

you for the remarks. It is good to know that a derby client setup works for local testing, while being more lightweight than postgres. We usually have one spark hudi job which creates/updates also hive tables and this we want to test locally.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\nis it really not possible to use the derby `memory` subprotocol (it is our preferred option for local tests)?\r\n- If it is not possible, then Hudi should throw a descriptive error message. Instead it pretends to have worked correctly, while no hive sync was done at all\r\n- if it is possible that would be really awesome (databricks delta e.g. supports it), as the test is then automatically fully independent of others (with a client setup you cannot run the tests in parallel easily, you need to be super careful about the ports, and filesystem)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1310552112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1310708904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7050#issuecomment-1310708904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7050","id":1310708904,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5OH9So","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T18:19:58Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T18:19:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta
