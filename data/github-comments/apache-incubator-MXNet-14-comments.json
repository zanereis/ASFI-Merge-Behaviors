And you will need the tricks below to help you use lengthy label (and, unfortunately, the label size must be fixed). \n1. Before you do preprocessing, write image list as follow: \n\n```\nimage_index  \\t  label_1 \\t  label_2  \\t label_3 \\t label_4 \\t image_path \n```\n1. When you use `im2rec` tool, remember to set `label_width=4` in the command line to generate specific RecordIO file.\n2. In your python code, pass `label_width=4` and `path_imglist=<<YOUR_IMAGE_LIST_PATH>>` to the `ImageRecordIter` constructor. \n   Then you are good to pop out the label with size (batch_size, label_width) with `mx.io.ImageRecordIter`. \n\nHope it helps. \n\nBTW, @piiswrong the usage of mysterious `label_width` magic is still missing in the document.

speed benchmark is tedious and the numbers are boring. Benjamin Franklin said more than two hundred years ago: \"'In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\" Today we should add competition to the list. Whether you like it or not, the competitors keep marketing to the massive potential users that [their pieces of software are the fastest](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/issues/66) to [obtain more users as soon as possible](http://www.ibtimes.com/singles-day-online-shopping-007-boosts-chinas-double-11-festival-makes-record-sales-2179107).\n\nThe GoogLeNet and VGG ILSVRC 2014 16 layers models from the Caffe model zoo are converted into MXNet models with [this tool](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/tools/caffe_converter). Both libraries are compiled with cuDNN R3 and run on a Maxwell architecture GPU. GoogLeNet is run for 100 iterations and VGG 16 is run for 10 iterations with the official tool `caffe time`. No official tool to benchmark MXNet models exists yet. So I write a script to do the job. But the Python `time.time()` outputs are near 0 indicating that the  forward and backward methods return immediately. The shell `time` command is used to get the real running time. There is [fixed time cost](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/282) each time a MXNet model is constructed and the first time is especially longer. Before benchmarking, each model is run for some burn-in iterations following the convention of [convnet-benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks) to reduce the effect. The running time of each iteration is measured by the average time difference of running for 10 iterations and 100 iterations to eliminate the fixed overhead. The final results are the mean of 10 runs.\n\nSeparate VGG 16 MXNet backward time is near zero using the above method. The backward method may have been optimized out without running forward or this is a bug. The GoogLeNet forward and backward time is not measured. The results are very surprising. I may have done something seriously wrong or MXNet is incredibly fast. Please correct me if the script or the benchmark method is incorrect. \n\n| Model | Step | MXNet | Caffe |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GoogLeNet | Forward-Backward | 26.37 | 69.8292 |\n| GoogLeNet | Forward | N/A | 37.5097 |\n| GoogLeNet | Backward | N/A | 32.2176 |\n| VGG-16 | Forward-Backward | 93.71 | 370.216 |\n| VGG-16 | Forward | 31.34 | 186.928 |\n| VGG-16 | Backward | 0 | 183.179 |\n\n``` python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport argparse\nimport time\n\nimport mxnet as mx\n\ndef load_model(mxnet_json, mxnet_params):\n    symbol = mx.sym.load(mxnet_json)\n    save_dict = mx.nd.load(mxnet_params)\n    arg_params = {}\n    aux_params = {}\n    for k, v in save_dict.items():\n        tp, name = k.split(':', 1)\n        if tp == 'arg':\n            arg_params[name] = v\n        if tp == 'aux':\n            aux_params[name] = v\n    return (symbol, arg_params, aux_params)\n\n# Basic Conv + BN + ReLU factory\ndef ConvFactory(data, num_filter, kernel, stride=(1,1), pad=(0, 0), act_type=\"relu\"):\n    conv = mx.symbol.Convolution(data=data, num_filter=num_filter, kernel=kernel, stride=stride, pad=pad)\n    bn = mx.symbol.BatchNorm(data=conv)\n    act = mx.symbol.Activation(data = bn, act_type=act_type)\n    return act\n\n# A Simple Downsampling Factory\ndef DownsampleFactory(data, ch_3x3):\n    # conv 3x3\n    conv = ConvFactory(data=data, kernel=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), num_filter=ch_3x3, pad=(1, 1))\n    # pool\n    pool = mx.symbol.Pooling(data=data, kernel=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), pool_type='max')\n    # concat\n    concat = mx.symbol.Concat(*[conv, pool])\n    return concat\n\n# A Simple module\ndef SimpleFactory(data, ch_1x1, ch_3x3):\n    # 1x1\n    conv1x1 = ConvFactory(data=data, kernel=(1, 1), pad=(0, 0), num_filter=ch_1x1)\n    # 3x3\n    conv3x3 = ConvFactory(data=data, kernel=(3, 3), pad=(1, 1), num_filter=ch_3x3)\n    #concat\n    concat = mx.symbol.Concat(*[conv1x1, conv3x3])\n    return concat\n\ndef inception():\n    data = mx.symbol.Variable(name=\"data\")\n    conv1 = ConvFactory(data=data, kernel=(3,3), pad=(1,1), num_filter=96, act_type=\"relu\")\n    in3a = SimpleFactory(conv1, 32, 32)\n    in3b = SimpleFactory(in3a, 32, 48)\n    in3c = DownsampleFactory(in3b, 80)\n    in4a = SimpleFactory(in3c, 112, 48)\n    in4b = SimpleFactory(in4a, 96, 64)\n    in4c = SimpleFactory(in4b, 80, 80)\n    in4d = SimpleFactory(in4c, 48, 96)\n    in4e = DownsampleFactory(in4d, 96)\n    in5a = SimpleFactory(in4e, 176, 160)\n    in5b = SimpleFactory(in5a, 176, 160)\n    pool = mx.symbol.Pooling(data=in5b, pool_type=\"avg\", kernel=(7,7), name=\"global_pool\")\n    flatten = mx.symbol.Flatten(data=pool, name=\"flatten1\")\n    fc = mx.symbol.FullyConnected(data=flatten, num_hidden=10, name=\"fc1\")\n    softmax = mx.symbol.SoftmaxOutput(data=fc, name=\"loss\")\n    return softmax\n\n\n\ndef build_model():\n    softmax = inception()\n    batch_size = 1\n    grad_req = 'write'\n\n    texec = softmax.simple_bind(ctx=mx.gpu(),\n                                data=(batch_size, 3, 224, 224),\n                                grad_req=grad_req)\n    return texec\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\n        description = 'Forward and backward computation benchmark')\n    parser.add_argument('-j', '--json',\n                        help = 'The network architecture in MXNet format')\n    parser.add_argument('-p', '--params',\n                        help = 'The binary parameter file in MXNet format')\n    parser.add_argument('-d', '--data_shape',\n                       help = 'Data shape: batch_size,channels,height,width')\n    parser.add_argument('-g', '--gpu_id', type = int, default = -1,\n                        help = 'GPU ID to use, default -1 for CPU')\n    parser.add_argument('-s', '--step', default = 'both',\n                        help = 'Which step to run: forward, backward or both'\n                        ', default both')\n    parser.add_argument('-i', '--iterations', type = int, default = 1,\n                        help = 'The number of iterations to run, default 1')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    for x in [args.json, args.params, args.data_shape]:\n        if x is None:\n            parser.print_help()\n            return    \n\n    symbol, arg_params, aux_params = load_model(args.json, args.params)\n    if args.gpu_id < 0:\n        device = 'cpu'\n    else:\n        device = 'gpu'\n    data_shape = tuple([int(x) for x in args.data_shape.split(',')])\n    step = args.step.lower()\n    ##

This comes in when there are multiple branching patterns in the graph.\n\nSo far, we find it is helpful for multiple GPU training and small workload in single card such as LSTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/156731742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/156732681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/575#issuecomment-156732681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/575","id":156732681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjczMjY4MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-14T18:47:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-14T18:47:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe you want to first check if other cuda based library runs, as installed cuda driver does not necessarily mean you are using it.
