A branch can be thought of as a chain of deltas that starts somewhere and ends with a specific commit. Rebasing means taking a chain of commits that ends one branch and swapping what comes before it to be another branch. So in this case, you would have swapped the prefix of your branch (which has all the commits in master _except_ those that were in #335) for master itself. You would have had to do exactly the same adjustments, but you would have ended up with a series of commits that appeared (from the POV of seeing how deltas add up to change) as though you had begun work after #335 merged, which makes for a cleaner public history. Of course your commits always keep their metadata, so we will always actually know when they occurred in clock time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/357724222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/357738708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/339#issuecomment-357738708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/339","id":357738708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzczODcwOA==","user":{"login":"xristy","id":3542294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDIyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy","html_url":"https://github.com/xristy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xristy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-15T16:58:04Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T16:58:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the help.

Previously, there was only the latter method.\r\n\r\n`VALUES ?foo {}` creates algebra `TableN` with declared variable `?foo` and no rows.

`Dataset`)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/370474093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/370474830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/368#issuecomment-370474830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/368","id":370474830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDQ3NDgzMA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T16:22:31Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T16:22:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This

It only became possible with dataset-transaction promotion (new to 3.7.0).  \r\n\r\nThis all has a lot of knock on consequences. The wrap/create distinction is quite important and that touches a lot of files; it is not reformatting. \"wrap\" a model and the dataset can not have named graphs added, \"create\" with a model and it starts with that model and can have named graphs added. We only used to have \"create\" which has overhead and complexity as well as occasionally leading to unexpected behaviour with SPARQL Updates (updates work but the new NG are in-memory and disappear on restart - better to have a closed dataset and catch the issue at update time).\r\n\r\nWhile testing, I found lack of test coverage and integration testing, which is the root of the users@ email that triggered this, was the place to put this.

(which only came along recently).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/371460985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/371536649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/375#issuecomment-371536649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/375","id":371536649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTUzNjY0OQ==","user":{"login":"jneubert","id":2128921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert","html_url":"https://github.com/jneubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jneubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-08T16:15:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T16:15:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much, Osma!\r\nOne small suggestion about the wording of the comment: Instead of ``Edit the line below to adjust memory size`` it could be perhaps more clear to write ``Edit the line below to adjust the amount of memory for Fuseki`` for people who are not familiar with Java memory management and could assume the total memory size of their machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/371536649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/371745459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/375#issuecomment-371745459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/375","id":371745459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTc0NTQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-09T08:24:04Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T08:24:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for your comments @ajs6f and @jneubert !

at the literals, we'd have the output from the table above.\r\n\r\nSo far I have just two unit tests in my working copy\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test public void testExecJson() {\r\n        //

test is doing - more or less - the same example you provided in your previous comment.

Then replaced my `analyzer` by a `DefinedAnalyzer`... had a few hiccups forgetting to create a tokenizer, and had to update the filter to use a `CharArraySet` (much better that way I think).\r\n\r\nBut in the end got the query working as expected.
