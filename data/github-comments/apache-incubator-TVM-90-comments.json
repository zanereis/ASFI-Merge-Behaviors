You don't really need to have BuildFactory as a class. In python you can return closures, which means you can do things functionally.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef make_build_func(args):\r\n    def my_build_func():\r\n        #   code\r\n    return my_build_func\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis being said, we actually can get a better solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n## What is a better solution\r\n\r\nThe real reason why we are doing such a level of indirection was really due to the fact that the ```tvm.cc.create_shared``` and ```export_library``` do not play well with each other . The reason that we need another level of indirection here is that we need to know the extension file type and the build_args which is separated by _build_common in the code. We can definitely get it cleaner by somehow suggests the extension type in the build function.\r\n\r\nConsider the following code, which is much cleaner\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import cc\r\n\r\ndef my_build_func(output, objects):\r\n     cc.create_shared(output, objects, cc=\"myg++\", **mykwargs)\r\n# annotate the library output format\r\nmy_build_func.lib_format = \"so\"\r\nbuilder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(my_build_func)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we enhance the export_library to support the following case\r\n```python\r\n# notice no suffix here\r\n#  the default lib_format suffix will be attached if hasattr(my_build_func, \"lib_format\")\r\n# otherwise a ValueError is raised.\r\nlib.export_library(\"mylib\", my_build_func)\r\n```\r\nNow we can even get rid of the build_common, because we can just take cc.create_shared as the build_func (assuming we also set the right lib_format).\r\n\r\nWhat is even better, we can enhance create_shared to return a partial functor if you do not specify output and objects(this might go a bit far but may worth the effort)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbuilder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(cc.create_shared(cc=\"myg++\", options=myopts))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this will require some changes to AutoTVM API, cc @merrymercy for thoughts\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477842695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477847715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2891#issuecomment-477847715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2891","id":477847715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzg0NzcxNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-29T02:57:59Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T02:57:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Hzfengsy @sxjscience @sgrechanik-h thanks for the reviews, I have updated the comment blocks to add more explanations about the proof","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477847715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/477849580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2921#issuecomment-477849580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2921","id":477849580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzg0OTU4MA==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-29T03:08:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T03:08:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sure.

this only works if we are generating code for the current host architecture, which isn't what we want. I think the right way here is to continue to pass `-mcpu` (or `-mattr`) to LLVM when we want to generate architecture-specific code, and then we can query the constructed `llvm::TargetMachine` instance to see if it has the supplied feature (which is how LLVM chooses how to select instructions already, so we're guaranteed to be consistent). This is how Rust, etc implements this kind of thing (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31709). We can pass -mattr=-f16c,-avx512f, etc if we want to disable this optimization.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/478303999/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/478316589","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2932#issuecomment-478316589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2932","id":478316589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODMxNjU4OQ==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-31T06:44:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-31T06:44:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We observe 15% performance degradation with the bug for a model.

However, the API provided by TVMRetValue--namely `From` and `Into`--is stable. It's more of a question of \"do we bundle more changes into this PR or make more PRs.\" This one accomplishes its original goal of having the frontend and runtime use the same types.\r\n\r\nI can emphasize with Ehsan, though. In his original PR, I was fussy about the same issue and asked him to change it to the previous repr (now the proposed repr). I do apologize for this, but unfortunately my precognition isn't what it used to be, and I didn't know what repr would make the types easier to unify. All I can do is promise that I (or someone else) will eventually make a PR (perhaps even this one) that addresses the issue. After all, who doesn't want a better Rust TVM? :)\r\n\r\n@ehsanmok if you feel strongly about enum-ifying TVMRetValue, I will gladly incorporate the changes into this PR, but it'll take a while since I also want to turn `register_global` into a proc macro attribute

explored @icemelon9 's register vm design in my branch: https://github.com/wweic/tvm/commits/relay-rts. Would like to share some data points.\r\n\r\nWe need to add special registers in VM for function arguments and return value. Return register is necessary because when callee function returns, its register file has gone. So return value must be persisted outside of register file. \r\n\r\nOpcode generation in register VM is easier, compiler doesn't need to maintain stack offsets all along, just memorize variable to register mapping. Then we need register allocation, I tried [liveness analysis](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/courses/411/16/lec/04-liveness.pdf) + [linear scan](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs132/linearscan.pdf). It's pretty straightforward since opcode is relatively simple. I'm not sure I understand @tqchen 's concern about handing control flow in register allocation.  Note that Haichen's register VM uses local register file per function. So we are doing register allocation per function, which shouldn't need to worry about interprocedural register allocations. As for branches inside a function, `live interval` of register can be the range from the earliest opcode to the last opcode that the register is live. I think linear scan would work fine under this setting.\r\n\r\nIn register VM we need to allocate a register file(`vector<Object>`) per call, equal to growing the stack in stack VM. I'm not sure if there will be much performance difference. \r\n\r\nOverall register VM is slightly easier to work with, debugging is painless. But I'm not sure if this is convincing enough to favor register VM. Also register VM's opcode size is larger, it might be a concern for embedded devices. \r\n\r\nThe major selling point of register VM is easy to discover dataflow. But it begs the questions that is register VM better at leveraging the dataflow information? I think it requires more thought. Fundamentally both VMs have call stack and will have similar problems when integrating with async execution engines.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/478447258/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/478464468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2928#issuecomment-478464468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2928","id":478464468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3ODQ2NDQ2OA==","user":{"login":"lixiaoquan","id":25603835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjAzODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25603835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaoquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-01T07:19:19Z","updated_at":"2019-04-01T07:19:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joshpoll

Summary\r\n@tqchen @icemelon9 @jroesch @zhiics @yongwww we discuss in person. Reached the following consensus:\r\n1. Remove `Phi` instruction. Instead extend `If` to write the result to a new register. \r\n2. Reuse the existing value stack as the register file. Have an anchor in the function frame to point to the start of each function's register region.\r\n3. Try to do liveness on Relay AST to reuse the pass manager infrastructure, and to not introduce extra interfaces.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I miss anything or said something wrong. I'll take out liveness analysis on opcodes from my branch and polish remaining stuff(register VM + linear scan + interfaces). Since we don't have liveness analysis on Relay AST now, I'll simply generate live interval for each register with the full opcodes range, so register allocator can assign unique slot for each register.
