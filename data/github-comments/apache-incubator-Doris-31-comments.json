That would be a useful feature! But I have some suggestions:\r\n> \r\n> 1. There may be hundreds of thousands of tablet on one BE, so it better to add some query parameter like `limit` or `offset` to limit the number of tablets returned. And use a default value, like limit 1000.\r\n> 2. I sorting out the RESTful API of Doris, in this PR #4261, it only describe the  RESTful API response body of FE, bug I thinks BE can also follow the rule. the response body is like:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     {\r\n>      \t\"msg\": \"OK\",\r\n>      \t\"code\": 0,\r\n>      \t\"data\": {\r\n>      \t\tyour real result data....\r\n>      \t},\r\n>      \t\"count\": 0\r\n>      }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> 1. Document. Every new API need a document in both English and Chinese. You can put them under `administrator-guide/http-actions/`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your suggestions, and I think your suggestions are very useful. I will modify my work:\r\n\r\n(1) API Response body will follow the rule in PR #4261.\r\n\r\n(2) I will add a document in both English and Chinese to describe the new API.\r\n\r\nHowever, the purpose of our work is to view all the tablets on a BE node, it is necessary to return all the tablets. In addition, only the tablet id and schema hash are returned in the data, thus the returned data capacity is not large.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/670301688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/670378957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/4286#issuecomment-670378957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4286","id":670378957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDM3ODk1Nw==","user":{"login":"imay","id":1249159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDkxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1249159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay","html_url":"https://github.com/imay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-07T07:41:19Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T07:41:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cause decimal_v2 use int128_t, C++ compiler will do some optimized for it.

We want to use React instead of Vue. \r\n**Here are some reasons.**\r\n\r\n- Vue3.x is at release candidate stage. It has a lot of breaking changes from the 2.x,  If we use Vue 2.x, We have to rewrite it again in the future which is we don't want to do.\r\n\r\n- Vue2.x is not working very well with TypeScript, TypeScript is important and it's future.\r\n\r\n**Here is the skill set we want to looks like**\r\n- React\r\n- TypeScript\r\n- Less\r\n- Eslint\r\n- Webpack\r\n- RxJS\r\n- Antd\r\n\r\nIn my opinion\r\n- `rem` or `px` is ok\r\n- Paginate related code could be a `react hooks`, like `usePaginate`.\r\n- OAuth and Swagger are great ideas. I think we can consider whether to add them to our code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/671784028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/671792496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/4308#issuecomment-671792496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/4308","id":671792496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTc5MjQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T07:58:39Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T07:58:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Why we need multi-languages?\r\n\r\nmulti-languages is required.
