Use the `mqadmin` modified packet to grab the pcap data and obtain it, such as modifying the number of threads to 1 and the capacity to 1, or closing certain flags to cause the service to be unusable\r\n\r\nThis problem needs to be resolved as soon as possible","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1798266284/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1800603565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5472#issuecomment-1800603565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5472","id":1800603565,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85rUwet","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-08T00:07:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T00:07:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is stale because it has been open for 365 days with no activity.

I would like to consult you on the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. In your experiment, are the controller, broker, etc. all deployed on the same machine? Because I noticed that you modified the code to use different ports such as localhost:9770, 9771, 9772, etc.\r\n2. So if I have three distributed controllers, will they all expose ports 9880 and 9770 to the broker by default? Does the broker need any configuration for this?\r\n3. Could you provide a complete sample configuration file for the proxy and broker?
