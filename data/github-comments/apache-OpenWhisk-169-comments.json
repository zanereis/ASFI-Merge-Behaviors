would be convenient to add an option to standalone openwhisk ton install the action catalogs. To install the packages, you can follow the instructions from [the samples catalog](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-catalog).\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-catalog.git\r\ncd openwhisk-catalog\r\n./packages/installCatalogUsingWskdeploy.sh 789c46b1-71f6-4ed5-8c54-816aa4f8c502:abczO3xZCLrMN6v2BKK1dXYFpXlPkccOFqm12CdAsMgRU4VrNZ9lyGVCGuMDGIwP http://localhost:3233\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to run the alarms or kafka service provider, there is more setup required as those have to startup microservices (in additional containers) to run the feed providers. These are also not part of the standalone bring up process at this point.\r\n\r\nContributions are welcomed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/670176772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/670177181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4922#issuecomment-670177181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4922","id":670177181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDE3NzE4MQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T20:31:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T20:31:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"POEM was merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/670177181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/670177491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4907#issuecomment-670177491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4907","id":670177491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDE3NzQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T20:32:05Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T20:32:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as inactionable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/670177491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/670178458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4904#issuecomment-670178458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4904","id":670178458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDE3ODQ1OA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-06T20:34:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T20:34:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Setting a password on the redis server would be a good enhancement. @aFuerst would you be interested in contributing a pull request?
