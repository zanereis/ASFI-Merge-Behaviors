What do you think about the suggestion on https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7233#issuecomment-474639633?\r\n\r\nI think if we go with where 7233 is going, the term for \"used segments\" would be \"published segments\". Fwiw, one reason I like this term because it lends itself well to being used as verbs in the following way:\r\n\r\n- A task would first _push_ a segment to deep storage, and then _publish_ it to the metadata store.\r\n- When a segment is dropped it is _unpublished_ from the metadata store by setting `used = false`.\r\n\r\n> Don't use terms 'enable/disable data source'\r\n\r\nYeah, I definitely also believe these terms are not great, and are confusing for the reasons you mention. Here the \"publish\" and \"unpublish\" terms are a bit awkward though. It doesn't sound right to say \"publish all segments in a datasource\" instead of \"enable a datasource\". \"Mark used\" or \"activate\" sounds better. I'm not sure how to reconcile this with the fact that I _do_ think \"publish\" sounds good & intuitive as a verb in the case where a task is initially writing a segment record to the metadata store.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is how:\r\n\r\n- Tasks \"publish\" segments when they insert records into the metadata store with `used = true` (upon creation of the segment)\r\n- Later on if we drop a segment, we do that by \"marking it unused\" or, potentially, \"deactivating\" it.\r\n- If we re-enable a segment, we do that by \"marking it used\", or, potentially, \"activating\" it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/476861755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/476871868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6896#issuecomment-476871868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6896","id":476871868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njg3MTg2OA==","user":{"login":"rae89","id":9400794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDA3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9400794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89","html_url":"https://github.com/rae89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rae89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-26T22:06:56Z","updated_at":"2019-03-26T22:06:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I

Brokers searches for non-overshadowed segments among available segments in tasks or historicals for query execution. Even in historicals, they searches for non-overshadowed segments among the segments loaded in itself (note that two segments of different versions but for the same interval can exist in the same historical before the coordinator cleans up the old one). I don't think it's worth to define different terms for various cases. It would make things more complicated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/476914630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/476920684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7233#issuecomment-476920684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7233","id":476920684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjkyMDY4NA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T01:12:46Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T01:12:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> is_overshadowed is defined as \"overshadowed by other published segments that are loaded in the cluster\"\r\n\r\nAny particular reason you’re thinking it makes sense to define `is_overshadowed` as “overshadowed by other published segments that are loaded”? (I assume this would mean: segments with used = true and that are available on some server)\r\n\r\nI’m thinking “overshadowed by some published segments” would be more useful in a debugging scenario. It allows you to write `is_published && !is_overshadowed` to mean “should be available”. In turn, comparing that to `is_available` helps narrow down where the current cluster state (what’s available) is different from the desired cluster state (what should be available).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/476920684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/476946764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7336#issuecomment-476946764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7336","id":476946764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njk0Njc2NA==","user":{"login":"xueyumusic","id":95261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic","html_url":"https://github.com/xueyumusic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xueyumusic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T02:52:43Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T03:56:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@surekhasaharan , thanks for reminding.

Our disagreement comes from what we consider \"meaningful\", which is more subjective.\r\n\r\nFor you, \"meaningful\" means returning useful and correct results regardless of the data being queried.\r\n\r\nFor me, it's OK if correctness depends on the data; for example, I consider binary search to be useful and capable of returning meaningful results, even though it returns garbage on unsorted data.\r\n\r\nYou probably also consider binary search to be useful. So the main difference is, I think, that it's usually simple to ensure that data fed to binary search is sorted, but much harder to ensure that data fed to topN is suitable along all combinations of aggregations/filters/intervals. That's the main practical problem with topN IMO. But the difficulty here depends on the size of the query space, which is application-specific, so I don't think there can be a single yes/no answer regarding whether one should use topN or not.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that you mention running brute force queries to verify topN correctness. It's actually quite viable, because the topN query quickly returns results to the user while the brute force (groupBy) query runs in the background using spare cluster resources. So the user experience is improved, even though the total computation time and resources are indeed larger than running only the brute force query.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/477396898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/477400925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7321#issuecomment-477400925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7321","id":477400925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzQwMDkyNQ==","user":{"login":"shuqi7","id":29443129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDQzMTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29443129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7","html_url":"https://github.com/shuqi7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuqi7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T00:51:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T00:51:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 👍\r\n> \r\n> Should you update the PR description to include mention of the change that the free-form author input has been removed and will use a fixed \"console\" as the author after this change?\r\n\r\nUpdated","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/477400925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/477402793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7365#issuecomment-477402793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7365","id":477402793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzQwMjc5Mw==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T01:01:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T01:01:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"gotta have those new lines in the ends of the files!

I did question whether making this same logical thing called the same would actually make positive, rather than negative impact on the codebase. However, now I also think it's higher probability that it will have positive impact on the codebase. So I will support the rename.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to me that this PR is conflicting with the rename. I think it's supportive to the rename because in this PR I did some nasty work at finding and sweeping old names and variants of naming that were looking completely unrelated. Now for the rename, somebody needs to make just two full-text searches in the codebase on Github (I did many more when preparing this PR):\r\n - \"[used segment](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/search?q=unused+segment&unscoped_q=used+segment)\"\r\n - \"[unused segment](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/search?q=unused+segment&unscoped_q=unused+segment)\"\r\n\r\nThen visit all result files that look relevant manually and rename \"used/unused segments\" to \"publish/published/unpublished\". (Note that this search needs to be performed after this PR is merged, because Github indexes only master codebase for full-text search.)\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I tag this PR `Development Blocker` for #7233.\r\n\r\n> Maybe this is how:\r\n\r\n> - Tasks \"publish\" segments when they insert records into the metadata store with used = true (upon creation of the segment)\r\n> - Later on if we drop a segment, we do that by \"marking it unused\" or, potentially, \"deactivating\" it.\r\n> - If we re-enable a segment, we do that by \"marking it used\", or, potentially, \"activating\" it.\r\n\r\nOh no, I think we must go all-in with publish/unpublish/published/unpublished terminology.

We currently use it so protect the last N days from being killed (usually 7 or 14 days for us).\r\n\r\nThe use case I am referring to is more of a `soft kill` for a set period fo time followed by an actual kill if no action was taken to re-enable the segments. This opposed to a permanent retain rule like the `durationToRetain` config does. Our initial idea was to only have the kill task runner run once per day, but that only gives us a good grace period for segments that wen't to unused shortly after the previous execution of the kill task process. Our main problem has been disabling datasources that were still needed and having them be killed before we were alerted to the problem.\r\n\r\nNow that I am thinking about this more, it may just be an administrative issue that my org needs to sort out on our own instead of adding this guard. We run a multi-tenant cluster in production with a large number of end users so the lines on what data is useful and what is stale can get blurred for us.

I have a follow-up question. Kill tasks can delete only unpublished segments (segments with `used = false` in metadata store) and this is also same when `durationToRetain` is set.

So, I guess the difference is a sort of soft-kill-period is reset once an unpublished segment is published again. Is this correct?

I'm not working on this anymore, and it kinda slipped my attention...\r\nAnyway, AFAIR, it works basically by knowing how much data will be sent and how it will be split into shards. After sending the data, it surely uses `/segments` to check if correct number of shards got created, and perhaps some other details, as well.\r\nIt works with multiple Tasks in parallel, independently, so it all has to be done at Task level.\r\n/cc
