If I understand your example correctly, a single argument of `/action` would be the equivalent of a basepath of `/`, an api path of `/action` mapping to an action called `action`.  Fully qualified action names would result in api paths like `/whisk.system/utils/echo`.  Is my understanding correct?\n- Re wildcard routes.  Maybe what you are asking for is how to create an api path that takes a path parameter?  At the moment that is not supported by the API GW; but we are aware of the need for this feature.\n- Not currently.  At the moment, there's no way for an action to discern which HTTP method was used to invoke the action.  We have some thoughts on how to surface this information to the action; at that time, I think your suggestion would be a nice enhancement.\n- Regarding the `wsk api list` output.  Would you like to see this additional path include both the base path and the api path, or just the api path?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261526933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261529658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1528#issuecomment-261529658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1528","id":261529658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTUyOTY1OA==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T13:19:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T13:21:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PG1 861 - API GW CLI tests passed\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261529658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261529929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1528#issuecomment-261529929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1528","id":261529929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTUyOTkyOQ==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T13:20:51Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T13:20:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Last Travis failure due to unrelated test case\n\n```\nsystem.basic.WskBasicTests > Wsk Action CLI should create and invoke a blocking action resulting in an error response object FAILED\n    org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: \"error: Unable to invoke action 'errorResponseObject': The connection failed, or timed out.

I think the challenge is to determine how much API-centric details to surface while configuring the action APIs.\n  \n  Due the the many possible API GW configuration properties, The CLI will probably not be able to provide args and options to fully configure every API option - in these cases, the API configuration can be exported (via the wsk CLI) in OpenAPI (i.e. Swagger) format, edited and then re-imported (via the wsk CLI).  The OpenAPI file will have basepath and path fields; so some understanding of this decomposition may be needed.\n  \n  Additionally, some folks may want more granular control of those values, so the CLI exposes them.  One possible way to support API-centric and OpenWhisk-centric developers is for the `wsk api create` command to accept a single argument in the form `/ACTION` - in addition to the allowing explicit basepath, api path and action arguments.  Would need to think a bit on how this would trickle out to the other commands.\n- Right now, separate CLI commands must be used to assign separate HTTP methods to the same action.\n- Re `wsk api list` suggestion.

for the feedback @jthomas \n- splitting into `basePath` and `path` \n  About the UX for getting started, the user can provide a single string like `/cats/dogs/rain` but to have a solution that we can configure the apigateway service and be able to generate a swagger file/spec. we have to split it into a `basePath` and `path` these two fields are entity required, we can only assume how to split `/cats/dogs/rain`  currently we are splitting into `/` and `/cats/dogs/rain` this is if the user doesn't go explicit, thinking that would be the more conservative way. \n  So if user creates a `get` on `/cats/dogs/rain` and we decide to split into `basePath=/cats/dogs` and `path=/rain`. \n  If the user creates another api operation `post` with `/cats/dogs/rain/monkeys` it will create a second swagger spec and API definition with `basePath=/cats/dogs/rain` and `path=/monkeys`\n  It might be an odd situation, but it might be OK since they always have the option to be explicit.\n  With using `/` then it will create a single API swagger and every api operation command were are not explicit will be under this API swagger.\n  The other way around every top parent path will create a new API swagger as long the first portion is the same.\n  I think is something to think about what would be the best default.\n- Using `*` for method as an override\n  I think is a cool idea very nice shortcut, take into account that all verbs (options, head, get, put, post, delete, etc..) supported will be created, but I think for getting started it might be a convenience and also demo wise a good thing, before starting to talk the other more advance customizations and control like the swagger and being explicit.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261603990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261617397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1495#issuecomment-261617397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1495","id":261617397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTYxNzM5Nw==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T19:18:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T19:18:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jthomas

to finish off this issue based on above comments: there are three desired behaviors. I'm taking it as a constraint not to disrupt the (v1) API too much hence PUT will continue to mean create or update. As such, we have:\n1. `PUT`: create entity iff doesn't exist else error\n2. `PUT + ?XXX=true`: update entity if it exists, create it otherwise\n3. `PUT + ?YYY=true`: update entity iff it exists, error otherwise\n\nWe currently use `XXX == overwrite` and support only `1-2` and not `3`.\n- The HTTP response code for `2` should change from 200 to 201 when entity is created instead of updated.\n\nSo as not to break uses of `overwrite` via direct HTTP calls but admit the additional use (`3`), I propose to repurpose `overwrite` for `3` and add `force` for `2`. The CLI correspondingly would allow:\n- `wsk action create` (same as `1`)\n- `wsk action update` (same as `3` where now it means `2`)\n- `wsk action create --force (same as`2`)\n- `wsk action update --force (same as`2`)\n\nThe CLI would also alias `--force` to `-f` for convenience.\n\nThis satisfies @csantanapr (done in the backend) and @mdeuser (don't create on update by default) and preserve convenience for deployment scripts (choice of `-f` on `create` or `update`).\n\nSoliciting thumbs up or down to adopt or reject, comments to refine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261718208/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261718607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/916#issuecomment-261718607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/916","id":261718607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTcxODYwNw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-19T14:58:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T14:58:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing

use by the openwhisk npm module when not running in an action in real runtime, to configure the module.\n\nI would like to see an environment variable that provides more info on the whisk edge point to include protocol, and port, this way I can use it for mocking and testing.\nmeaning I want to be able to run a server on 'http://localhost:3000' that mocks the whisk api for testing, and my actions to run them locally which whisk.invoke()  and it will send the request to 'http://localhost:3000' instead of 'https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net'. \nIf we add 'http' to nginx edge for local dev it can be use to point to this also.\n\nmaybe making `__OW_EDGE_HOST` contain protocol and port info, or have that info in different

Instead of doing that I suggested if one want to do that they can sequence an action to record activation parameters either by logging them or as the result of an echo action. \n\nIn other words the system already provides a way for the user to record incoming parameters.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261809052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/261809209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/512#issuecomment-261809209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/512","id":261809209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTgwOTIwOQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-20T21:59:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T21:59:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We're not talking about dropping logs.

If the code is not accessible to the user the alternative is a sequence - an openwhisk strength and it's quite convenient to create new sequences.\n\nSo on one hand we leverage the strengths of the system for the case where user wants to log parameters.

Not need it I think. I prefer the anonymous (just a preference :-)) \r\nI know that lambda and other have this extra level like `modules.exports.handler`, I think having the extra handler is OK but not necessary as a base level to get started with simple actions.\r\n\r\nFor nodejs we can have customization with nice fall back defaults allowing for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nLet's say we added a property to the action metadata call `Handler: string`\r\nIf Handler is defined (let's say `Handler: 'handler'`) then we assume user did this:\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports.handler = (params)=> params;\r\n``` \r\nThen if Handler is not defined we can check for `main` to see if user did this (for backwards compatibility, or deprecated)\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports.main = (params)=> params;\r\n```\r\nThen if Handler not defined, and no function in `module.exports.main`, then we can check if the user exported the action as the module like\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = (params)=> params;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne more benefit or having a metadata `Handler` also allows for folks getting in the serverless space to try out openwhisk re-using code where they are already exporting a [named function](https://darrenderidder.github.io/talks/ModulePatterns/#/7)

Not knowing the _Deploy to Bluemix_ workflow I'm sharing my thoughts on this to get feedback and improve the idea collaboratively.\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n* streamline the _time-to-value_ for developers trying openwhisk \r\n* let developers focus on the code first and later learn about wsk CLI & friends\r\n\r\nAssumptions: \r\n* JS actions only for start\r\n* The GitHub repo can be github.com or another GitHub Enterprise deployment\r\n* The GitHub is accessible by the OpenWhisk deployment\r\n* The Developer writing the action/function doesn't have to know about:\r\n  * wsk cli\r\n  * setting up wsk credentials \r\n  * any other wsk internals\r\n* if developers want to include extra libraries / npm modules they need to upload them into the git repo so that all the code can be downloaded from Git in a simple archive format.\r\n* developers would eventually use the `wsk ` CLI for more advanced use-cases\r\n\r\nThe workflow would be as follows:\r\n* the developer clones an existing GitHub repo containing a `hello-world` function or some other simple action\r\n* the `README` of the repo contains instruction for setting up\r\n  * create a webhook to the new repository by either:\r\n     * setting up the hook manually in the GitHub UI\r\n     * adding an `access token` into a manifest\r\n     * maybe include the button *Deploy To Openwhisk* as part of the `README`\r\n* invoke the function via a REST API\r\n* other examples may include more info for setting up event handlers with feeds and triggers\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n* create an OpenWhisk function to download a Git Archive and update/create an action from it\r\n* reuse the [manifests](https://github.com/openwhisk/wskdeploy/tree/master/tests/testcases/helloworld) from the [wskdeploy](https://github.com/openwhisk/wskdeploy) project\r\n* when a manifest file is missing assume some defaults:\r\n  * src of the function is `main.js`\r\n  * action name = git org and git repo name. maybe `<git_org>/<git_repo>` or if `/` is an invalid character for the name use `_`: `<git_org>_<git_repo>`\r\n  * namespace = a default namespace that maps to the GitHub deployment. I.e for github.com use `github.com` as namespace. This ensure there's no collision if GitHub is combined with GitHub enterprise for instance.\r\n* use a preconfigured whisk user ( i.e. `wsk_deployer`) for creating/updating actions created in GitHub *OR*\r\n* automatically configure a new user in openwhisk based on the GitHub ID / owner of the new repo . TBD how developers can link accounts later when creating their own accounts. \r\n\r\n
