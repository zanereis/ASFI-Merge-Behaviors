Thanks\n\n**Requirement from customer** - “topology.acker.executors” is a Storm parameter, which refers to at-least-once when it’s not 0, and at-most-once if it’s 0.

(the cyclic function is called every 100ms). Or one every 5-10 second is still acceptable since this is only needed rarely.\nUsing (currentTimeStampMs / 1000 % intervalInSeconds == 0) as the update condition might make more sense than using random number.  For intervalInSeconds, we can use 5 or 10. Most of the ZK traffic would be read. Assume ZK (3 nodes) can sustain ~50K req/second. 5% of its capacity can satisfy 25K workers if setting the intervalInSeconds as 10. \n\nThanks a
