This will take some time but the index is persisted to disk. Once built, queries will return very quickly. Any new docs will cause an incremental (small) update and queries will still be fast.\r\n\r\nthe os_process_timeout setting is for each time we evaluate javascript. In the case of view building, it would be how long it takes to run the 'map' function of your view. So you really don't need it to be so high. The default of 5000 ms is usually sufficient for view building but it's common to increase it

a silly benchmark to test a few approaches:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nickva/couch_ebench\r\n\r\nThe test uses a few encoders and the two custom Erlang modules. Inputs to the test can be scaled by size and those sizes are provided on the command line. So size 1000 for example for str_basic will create 1000 character string, for nested array will create a nested array of depth 1000, etc.\r\n\r\nThe time reported is the time to run a single length check in microseconds. A smaller input size will be run a bunch of tries in a row then time will be averaged.  So inputs of size 10 will be run for 1000 times in a row, size 1000, 10 times, size 10k+ 1 time.\r\n\r\nExample run for inputs of 10, 1000 and 10k sizes: \r\n\r\n```\r\n ./build.sh && ./run.sh 10 1000 10000\r\n...\r\nGenerating inputs...\r\nRunning benchmark 4 encoders x 42 tests.
