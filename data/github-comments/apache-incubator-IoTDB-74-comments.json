> Hi, in align by device query, we see each device as one relational table with (device + timestamp) as the primary key. When querying multiple devices, the result is **sorted by device order first, and then by timestamp order.** Therefore, **it's not a wrong order, but the current standard we defined.**\r\n> > However, this standard does not satisfy some users' cases indeed. But **if modified simply as you did, maybe other users still want the result order before.** So we have been tried to redefine the semantics in the next version and support these two order at the same time.\r\n> > Thank you for the contribution anyway :D\r\n> \r\n> Is there any document or web page that describes the new semantics? We want to use this feature in our system. If the semantics have been redefined, we can adopt to it first in our inner version to minimize the effort to upgrade later.\r\n\r\nIt seems that docs doesn't explain this semantics, we will add it
