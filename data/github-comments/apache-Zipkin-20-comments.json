hate to say it, but I think we are nearly a point where recreating a UI would be less work than maintaining it.\n\nGood news: It is possible to update all libraries with the exception of dagre-d3.\n\nBad news: there's custom trimming involved, and this isn't represented in the bower file. This means I can't update it easily unless we want to check in a lot of junk.\n\nUgly news:  dagre-d3 is very tangled. If you try to update it, you'll get in a mess between versions of dagre and d3. After a few hours, I was unable to sort problems such as undefined references to functions with requirejs shims. See #772, which says all that work is wasted as we need another means to create sankey or similar diagram.\n\nNext step:\n\nIf we don't want to throw away the UI, we need to maintain it far better than we are now.

Do note that this was done to support in-process traces (is this frame-granularity trace?). For example:\n\n```\n* Note that \"Span\" in our case denotes a single node, \"SpanEvent\" denotes a method-level trace\n----> | Span (id=1)\n      | SpanEvent seq=0 (nextSpanId=11) -----> | Span (id=11, parentSpanId=1)\n      | SpanEvent seq=1\n      | SpanEvent seq=2 (nextSpanId=12) ----------> | Span (id=12, parentSpanId=1)\n* Also Note that only RPC SpanEvents have nextSpanIds.\n```\n\nWithout `nextSpanId`, we couldn't map Spans 11 and 12 to a SpanEvent and by extension give them ordering (as SpanEvents have sequences within them). `nextSpanId` is issued by the parent and the child uses it as it's Span id.\nPlus, using both `nextSpanId` and `parentSpanId` to reconstruct the call graph helps in mitigating SpanId collision (two-way comparison.instead of one).\n\n**async\\* variables**\nSimilar to `nextSpanId` above, but used for context propagation across threads. We emulate an asynchronous call as a new Span internally (except we don't create a new node for it), kinda similar to the example above but with asynchronous invocations instead of RPC calls. For example,\n\n```\n----> Span (id=1)\n      | SpanEvent seq=0\n      | SpanEvent seq=1 (nextAsyncId=11) ----async----> | Async \"Span\" (id=11)\n      | SpanEvent seq=2\n```\n\nThis is exactly the same as what happens in RPC calls, except that a SpanEvent may have more than 1 asynchronous invocations :\n\n```\n----> Span (id=1)\n      | SpanEvent seq=0\n      | SpanEvent seq=1 (nextAsyncId=11) ----async----> | Async \"Span\" asyncSequence=0 (id=11)\n      |                                  |---async----> | Async \"Span\" asyncSequence=1 (id=11)\n      | SpanEvent seq=2\n```\n\nHope I got everything right without confusing everyone too much.\n\nPS. wanted to post something on this to the Google Docs, but didn't know how to edit it nicely

One way to reduce surface area is to only expose `zipkin-web`. There's work to do in order to lock that down, and bear in mind I've not seen all things possible in finagle-land.\n\n`zipkin-web` is a [TwitterServer](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-server), and very similar to [Finatra](https://github.com/twitter/finatra). Most patterns of Finatra could be applied to `zipkin-web`. To do authentication, you'd likely end up writing a filter or explicit code. I've found two examples:  [finatra-angular-example](https://github.com/pvoznenko/finatra-angular-example/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/acme/ShoppingCart/controllers/Api/UsersApi.scala#L19) and [finatra-tweet-example](https://github.com/twitter/finatra/blob/master/http/src/test/scala/com/twitter/finatra/http/integration/tweetexample/main/filters/AuthFilter.scala)\n\nThe subject of authorization would be slightly more complex. There's a mix of responsibilities inside `zipkin-web`, presumably folks optimizing for how much data is going to the browser, but honestly, I've no idea. This mix presents itself as some javascript components calling json endpoints, and mustache template rendering doing other things. This scatters the authorization concern a bit, as if there was only a \"normal\" json query api, you could just secure that. For example, to authorize by service, code would likely need to wrap the underlying SpanStore object as that's the choke-point for data.\n\nThe work involved in unwinding this problem is essentially refactoring the javascript UI to only use the query server's api. Authorization code could be much simpler, even at the http abstraction. That said, there would be a caveat, which is that you need to inspect the json to ensure a call to getTraces (by id) doesn't accidentally return data the user shouldn't see. That's because it isn't likely all storage implementations will be able to support transparent authorization.\n\nRegardless, once the UI only makes calls to a narrowly defined set of endpoints, you'd have relatively straight-forward authorization. This would be whatever you can code in finatra, or any number of established patterns supported by [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), such as [OAuth](https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/03/sso-with-oauth2-angular-js-and-spring-security-part-v) (as [zipkin-java](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin) is a boot

Don't read too much into what's logged in old issues, but I will\nhave a look at it.\n\nWe now have verbose README files, detailing the minimum variables you need\nto set, and doc folders on both zipkin and also the docker-zipkin projects.\nUsers no longer have to build the project as we took great effort to\npublish binaries and also docker images.\n\nThe binaries are on bintray and docker images are on both quay and also\ndockerhub.\n\nMaybe if you can mention your specific use-case, we can update zipkin.io to\nbe more obvious.\n\nI know there's still work to do, but you are far better off as you don't\nhave to run sbt or gradle ;) Regardless, we are on gitter.im on\nopenzipkin/zipkin and folks deploy in many ways. Many use docker, which we\nsupport best. Some use chef or other tools.\n\nHope this helps and thanks for keeping us honest!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/150591631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/150622064","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/793#issuecomment-150622064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/793","id":150622064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDYyMjA2NA==","user":{"login":"jamescway","id":473680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/473680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway","html_url":"https://github.com/jamescway","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamescway/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-23T16:13:38Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T16:13:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The schema functions better as an example to follow at the moment.
