Thanks for the pull request. It looks like you have included lots of unrelated whitespace changes: removing whitespace on empty lines and changing spaces to tabs. It would be great if you could undo those changes as they really distract from the code you actually did change :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/175988502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/comments/185722647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rya/pull/18#issuecomment-185722647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rya/issues/18","id":185722647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTcyMjY0Nw==","user":{"login":"amihalik","id":4710489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTA0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4710489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik","html_url":"https://github.com/amihalik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amihalik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T13:38:59Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T13:38:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.

There are defaults (such as target/) which are automatically included via the apache parent pom, but it's good practice to localize any exclusions to the rat check in the sub-modules (to avoid unexpected exclusions). I can try to help you out with this if you get stuck.\n\n>  I don't understand why apache-rat didn't catch the \"Copyright Rya\" in these two files.
