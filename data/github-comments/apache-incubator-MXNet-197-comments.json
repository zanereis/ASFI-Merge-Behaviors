The problems with choosing lazy eval are a) the runtime conditionals mentioned above and b) the fact that as GPUs get faster and faster graph-building starts to be more costly than execution.\r\n\r\nUltimately what we need is either a magical static analyzer that can convert imperative-looking Python into an MXNet-like symbolic graph or a combination of autobatching with lazy eval together with annotations that say \"this function can be statically compiled.\" MXNet is pretty well-positioned to do that since it's always had a mixed imperative-symbolic approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/303530662/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/303539347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6199#issuecomment-303539347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6199","id":303539347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzUzOTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"madjam","id":8388825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODg4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8388825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam","html_url":"https://github.com/madjam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-23T21:36:04Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T21:36:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong
