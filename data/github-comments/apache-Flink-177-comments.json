investigating a bit further, I noticed that this problem is actually a bit bigger:\r\nEven in `FileSystemBlobStore`, there is no guarantee that a directory will not be deleted concurrently (from a `delete` method) between its creation and writing a file (in a `get` method):\r\n* the `delete` method for name-addressable blobs always deletes the job-specific storage directory if there is no further blob for this job\r\n* the content-addressable blobs do that similarly but are shared among jobs and thus only delete directories if there is no other blob.\r\n\r\nSince name-addressable blobs have not been used so far and the latter case typically does not occur concurrently with `get` requests, this has not been a problem so far.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I ~~suggest to create a separate JIRA~~ created [[FLINK-6380]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6380) for this (delete vs. get/put) concurrency issue and ~~apply~~ applied a quick fix for

And right, your question is very good. I originally thought that the user must be sure to know all the output topic when the job is submitted, but in the real business scenario, the data may be output to the dynamically generated topic. \r\n\r\nFor the requirement of generate dynamic topic, I propose to adjust the open and partition api of KafkaPartitioner as follows:\r\n1. The open method, remove the parameter int[] partitions, and will be opend once for each partitioner\r\npublic void open(int parallelInstanceId, int parallelInstances)\r\n2. The partition method, add int[] partitions and target topic parameters\r\npublic int partition(T next, byte[] serializedKey, byte[] serializedValue, String topic, int[] partitions)\r\n\r\n@gyfora @tzulitai What do you think of this?
