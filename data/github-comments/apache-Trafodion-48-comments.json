am kind of confused with the explanation because of a need for a data source management to do connection.setSchema method call.  To issue SET SCHEMA <schema_name> command there is no need to obtain the catalog.  Even in the current implementation,  SET SCHEMA <schema_name> doesn't prefix the catalog name.  Just found that  getCatalog command is also implemented as a request sent to the server. Hence we can let this implementation to go in.\n\nHowever, my recommendation would be as follows:\n\nJDBC applications are expected to use setCatalog and setSchema method to set the default catalog and schema.  JDBC applications tend to use getCatalog(), getSchema() as if it is lightweight command. So, there is real need to improve this mechanism.\n\nYes. Trafodion doesn't have the mechanism to obtain the current catalog and schema via CLI call.  We can improve this and JDBC driver/server can be improved to obtain this default value as a response to connection request. Then the driver can maintain the current catalog/schema whenever setCatalog/setSchema is issued. Then it can service these methods from the driver itself.\n\nTo answer @DaveBirdsall question, there are two process hops with the current implementation for getCatalog(), getSchema(), setCatalog() and setSchema() and longer path length.\n\nWith the improved mechanism, getCatalog() and getSchema() will have no process hop. setCatalog() and setSchema() will have one process hop and much shorter path length.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/237878860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/237900544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/642#issuecomment-237900544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/642","id":237900544,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzkwMDU0NA==","user":{"login":"moscowgentalman","id":12948514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ4NTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12948514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman","html_url":"https://github.com/moscowgentalman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T16:42:26Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T16:42:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Failure test case:\nHIVE003\nHIVE004\ncompGeneral 042\n\nSo it is identical with main branch failures, not introduced by this RP.
