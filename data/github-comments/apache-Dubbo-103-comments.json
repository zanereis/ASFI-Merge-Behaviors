Currently, Dubbo consumers can only interact with those providers with identically the same group and version, but we may change this behavior soon. For example, let consumer consume providers with version v1 and v2 at the same time, to enable canary deployment or A/B test.

@ qq405576297 no session问题体现出的是业务架构分层涉及的一个典型问题，不是个例.dubbo服务框架解决问题不涉及到ORM框架，所以这个问题不属于dubbo需要解决的问题范畴。这里我给出一个工程上的最佳实践，ORM框架处理的实体是数据库DO对象，而dubbo传输的是DTO对象，你所要做的是在业务层将数据库的DO对象转换成DTO对象，由于是你自己的service，所以不存在session关闭的问题，对于DTO对象，是不存在懒加载的问题的。\r\n> \r\n> 作为实验性质的解决方案，注意，这可以解决你没有会议的问题，但不被推荐，你可以自定义dubbo filter，手动操控spring的TransactionMananger，打开事务，可以“解决”你的问题。\r\n\r\n如果在被dubbo调用的方法上已经有了事务，那么无论在Filter中怎么操作TransactionMananger都没效果（还是会有懒加载问题），至少我测试是这样的。如果是我的方式不对，希望可以给一个有测试过的，demo或关键代码。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/470372305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/470376895","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3605#issuecomment-470376895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3605","id":470376895,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDM3Njg5NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-07T04:06:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T03:26:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
