I have addressed most of the issues in new commit.\n\nAbout tests:\nI will add a unit test, which mocks AmazonKinesis and runs whole job using direct pipeline runner. This should give us more confidence in the solution.\n\nI'm not aware of any \"free\" full Kinesis implementation (I've found in-memory kinesis implementation: https://github.com/mhart/kinesalite, but I'm not sure it'll give us more than mocking the AmazonKinesis interface in unit tests). Moreover, Kinesis has no free quota in Amazon, so you need to have billing enabled to use it :(\nI took a look at BigTableReadIT test and it seems like I can do a similar thing for Kinesis - then, as you said, someone would need to provide kinesis option to run this and it'll have to be manually enabled.\n\nWhen I said \"run this on real Dataflow\" I meant Beam 0.1.0-incubating on Google Cloud Dataflow (as I already said in my previous comment - this is working fine now)\n\nP.S.

But this dependency should be shaded immediately, not left as a future task.\n\nI'll update this PR accordingly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234012684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234013029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/697#issuecomment-234013029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/697","id":234013029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDAxMzAyOQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T17:01:50Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T17:01:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@aljoscha yes, you are exactly right about the reason behind this.

I can see a runner wanting to know enough to perform its own validation.\n\n**Bad option**: (strawman to match what we have today): \n- The URN of the UDF clearly identifies it. Problem: there can be no hierarchy with `instanceof` so the cases of interest would have to be enumerated.\n- The SDK puts relevant metadata in the SDK-specific payload. Problem: the SDK doesn't necessarily know what is relevant.\n- The runner groks the SDK-specific payload. Problem: not language independent, breaking abstraction that is allowed to change whenever. Total non-starter.\n\n**Good option**:\n- The UDF envelope has a place for resource/capability requirements, which are a standardized spec.\n- The SDK puts relevant metadata in the capability requirements. Same problem as above, but the capability requirement spec lists all the options. An I/O author must consult them, and propose new ones if needed.\n- The runner can then decide whether it is able to provide the required capabilities.\n\nAssuming the second choice, we have yet to nail down how such capability requirements should be expressed. It all comes down to the Fn envelope. Great example to work with.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234018005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234022405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/681#issuecomment-234022405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/681","id":234022405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDAyMjQwNQ==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T17:34:41Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T17:34:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234022405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234022802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/701#issuecomment-234022802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/701","id":234022802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDAyMjgwMg==","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T17:36:05Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T17:36:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Will

Intuitively it means \"no cluster needs to be set up\". I guess the important things would be:\n- No set up\n- No network needed (so a hermetic test that starts a real non-local cluster won't work)\n- No credentials\n\nIt applies not just to runners but also to tests. For example, KafkaIO can run an embedded Kafka, and that will work with local Flink & Spark. Whereas Dataflow doesn't have a local version since it is a hosted service.\n\nDoes this seem reasonable? If not, is there somewhere we can go with this idea?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234596975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/234599706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/710#issuecomment-234599706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/710","id":234599706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDU5OTcwNg==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T17:06:40Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T17:06:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Right.
