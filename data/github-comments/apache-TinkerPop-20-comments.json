My limited reading on the subject made it seem like there are difference between how it would be implemented in python 3.x and 2.x as well. note sure if @davebshow has a minute to shed any light on this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/257915744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/257919088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/478#issuecomment-257919088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/478","id":257919088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzkxOTA4OA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T16:29:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T16:29:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think that, instead of doing blocking calls like fn.apply() on a thread pool, we could expose a fully async API.

Internally, from a Java perspective anyway, `toListAsync()` does the same thing, doesn't it?\n\nBy fully async I meant asynchronous execution that doesn't block in any call and doesn't require a threadpool. All the way down, it would be based on futures / async operations. In java, it would mean no `CompletableFuture::get()` calls.\nThat translates into supporting higher levels of concurrency as there is no threadpool limiting the amount of calls in parallel.\n\nFor TinkerPop, it would require asynchronous strategies as currently the blocking calls are made in the `apply()` method. I've suggested an `applyAsync()` method for an async strategy interface that returns a `CompletableFuture`.\n\nFor other technologies, the same logic applies as we shouldn't care about the underlying framework / network library (Python tornado / libuv / ...) or thread pools.\nFor C#, it would be `Task` all the way down; for Python it could be async generators or futures all the way down; for Javascript, Promise or async callbacks; ...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/258090658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/258105341","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/474#issuecomment-258105341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/474","id":258105341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODEwNTM0MQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T10:16:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T10:16:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All tests pass with `docker/build.sh -t -n -i`\n\nVOTE +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/258105341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/258168660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/478#issuecomment-258168660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/478","id":258168660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODE2ODY2MA==","user":{"login":"newkek","id":3471564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3471564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek","html_url":"https://github.com/newkek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newkek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T15:03:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T16:23:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The issue with using a secondary thread pool that will start a new thread for each Traversal execution would be more important when the Traversal is backed by a RemoteConnection.

AFAIK `PathProcessor` is only used by strategies to easily identify traversals with \"special requirements\". Both, `SimpleStep` and `CyclicStep`, access the current `traverser.path()` and thus they **process** the **path**, which makes them `PathProcessor`s :).\n\nI can also rely on the result of `getRequirements()`, but this would make the strategy a bit slower and I really don't see why `SimplePath` and `CyclicPath` should not be `PathProcessor`s.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/259860387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/259860740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/486#issuecomment-259860740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/486","id":259860740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTg2MDc0MA==","user":{"login":"dkuppitz","id":572377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dkuppitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkuppitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T01:52:23Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T01:52:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You know what, I will revert the change and not implement `PathProcessor` in `SimplePathStep`.
