have been researching both superset and airflow for adoption at my enterprise (thanks mistercrunch for your open source contributions!) and I know airflow is also planning to use FAB for security.  I am just beginning to look at the security aspects and I have some similar thoughts/needs as shared by laranzu.\r\n\r\nThe gist code was very helpful to get me started but I may not be able to have a database at the backend, like FAB seems to presume.  \r\n\r\nI currently have a flask based application where I get a SamlToken from SSO provider which gives me user id, AD groups the user belongs to.  From the AD groups, I construct roles (that I persist in session/cookie) and use Flask Principal and provide role based access to routes.  I am hoping for a similar mechanism with a superset_config where I override the bare minimum classes.\r\n\r\nI hope I am at least making sense!
