Normally with jQuery it is possible to return false from `beforeSend` handle to cancel the request, however it's not a case with wicket's `bsh`. I could do something like this:\r\n```JavaScript\r\n            Wicket.Ajax.ajax({\r\n                u: myUrl,\r\n                m: 'POST',\r\n                mp: true,\r\n                bsh: [\r\n                    function (attributes, jqXHR, settings) {\r\n                        settings.xhr = function () {\r\n                            try {\r\n                                if (uploadContext.cancelled) {\r\n                                    // cancel upload\r\n                                    return null;\r\n                                }\r\n                                if (uploadContext.item) {\r\n                                    /* Add progress indicator */\r\n                                    xhr.upload.addEventListener(\"progress\", function (e) {\r\n                                        var progress = Math.round(e.loaded / e.total * 100);\r\n                                        onUploadProgress(uploadContext, attrs, progress);\r\n                                    });\r\n                                }\r\n                                return xhr;\r\n                            } catch (e) {\r\n                            }\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does the trick, however it will cause the jQuery.send to explode with `Cannot read property 'open' of null`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best way to do that, but probably `_executeHandlers` could return false if any of handlers returns false, something like this:\r\n```JavaScript\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * A helper function that executes an array of handlers (before, success, failure)\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * @param handlers {Array[Function]} - the handlers to execute\r\n\t\t * @private\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\t_executeHandlers: function (handlers) {\r\n\t\t\tif (jQuery.isArray(handlers)) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// cut the handlers argument\r\n\t\t\t\tvar args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).slice(1);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t// assumes that the Ajax attributes is always the first argument\r\n\t\t\t\tvar attrs = args[0];\r\n\t\t\t\tvar that = this._getTarget(attrs);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tfor (var i = 0;
