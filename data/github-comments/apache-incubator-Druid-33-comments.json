Priority should follow the convention for query priority, where higher numbers mean higher priority, and lower numbers mean lower priority.\n2. Priority of 0 or missing should mean use default.\n\nAs such, I think there are two issues here. One is about preemption at all, and the other is about preemption rules.\n\nAs per #1513 preemption at all seems to be something that is desired. So the question that is outstanding is how to define rules for preemption.\n\nThere are a few other task engines that have \"can I be preempted\" and \"what is my priority\" as two independent constructs, and I think that would make sense to consider here. In such a case, a lock can only be pre-empted if it is set to be ABLE to be preempted, and if the preempting task has a higher priority on the preemption scale. If a task is NOT flagged as preempt-able, OR is flagged as preempt-able but the other task is at a lower rank on the priority scale, then no preemption would occur.\n\nIf two tasks are vying for resources (be it a lock or an execution slot in the cluster) it would be nice if we had a unified \"priority\" that was independent of preemption.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/139008613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/139010118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1695#issuecomment-139010118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1695","id":139010118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAxMDExOA==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T19:01:28Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T19:01:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@himanshug

Just to recap, right now \"can I be preempted\" is a function of priority. So a task is preempt-able if higher priority task comes in except when the task is working in a critical section and has upgraded its lock to be non-preempt-able.\nNow what your are proposing here is to separate these concerns, so who decides whether the task can be preempted ? One way would be make all tasks preempt-able unless user specifically sets it to non-preempt-able in the task json.\nAs for the convention for priority number we can model it in the same way as query priority. I originally modeled priority number in same way as [nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_%28Unix%29) utility does.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/139024383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/139025084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1679#issuecomment-139025084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1679","id":139025084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAyNTA4NA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T19:43:05Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T19:43:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pjain1 to maintain current behavior, the default would be that a task is not preempt-able unless specified that it can be.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/139025084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/139037703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1679#issuecomment-139037703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1679","id":139037703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAzNzcwMw==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T20:33:12Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T20:33:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen changing the notion of what is high/low priority sounds good.\n\ndid you want \"can i be prempted\" check only for things to be backwards compatible?

How users are supposed to handle the different jclouds providers : https://jclouds.apache.org/reference/providers/ Having docs on which ones are supported and which ones are not and how to enable/use them should be mentioned either in docs or at a minimal in the pom.xml. \n4.

the reason behind introducing UnionTimelineLookup at the historical was to distribute the merging load on both historical and broker. \n\nIt seems the historical does not have enough information to work on multiple DataSources and figure out the correct one here. \nwe would either need to add the dataSource info to the MultipleSegmentSpec or revert back to the old way of letting the broker handle breaking the query into individual datasources and send query for individual datasources down to the historical nodes. \n\nI think we could revert back the breaking changes and let the broker send the query for individual DS down to the historical nodes. @fjy @gianm I will make a PR for reverting them if it sounds good to you ?
