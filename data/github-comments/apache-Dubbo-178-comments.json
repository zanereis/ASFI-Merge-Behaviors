I think this might be better；\r\n> For Examaple: directServiceImpl&group=test&interface=org.apache.dubbo.samples.direct.api.DirectService&version=0.1\r\n\r\nFor current design for Dubbo, it is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for users to register or refer a interface while therer have another interface have the same three attributes (interfaceClass, group, version). For provider and consumer sides, this will cause potential problem. So I think `group/interface:version` just enough and we can make it fast fail when users act such forbidden action in provider side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/818479999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/818481765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/5843#issuecomment-818481765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5843","id":818481765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODQ4MTc2NQ==","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T06:40:06Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T06:41:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@haiyang1985 Thanks for your contribution.\r\n\r\nSince for this pr has been existed for so long, I have create a pr to patch this. \r\n\r\nSee #7533","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/818481765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/818506628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/7534#issuecomment-818506628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7534","id":818506628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODUwNjYyOA==","user":{"login":"rockit-ba","id":53960157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTYwMTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53960157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba","html_url":"https://github.com/rockit-ba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockit-ba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T07:22:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T07:22:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Error: /home/runner/work/dubbo/dubbo/dubbo-common/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/annotation/Service.java:30:15: Unused import - org.apache.dubbo.common.constants.CommonConstants.DEFAULT_LOADBALANCE.
