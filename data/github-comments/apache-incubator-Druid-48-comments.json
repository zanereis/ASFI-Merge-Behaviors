I feel this is a very useful operational feature. I believe doing things manual has chance of fat-fingering interval or datasource and these steps generally don't go through the review process unlike code or config.\n\nI have couple suggestions to add as requirements, which also might help in reducing the risk of loosing data that we don't want to loose.\n\nSo, two suggestions:\n1. Making the retention configurable - saying N hours, N days, N weeks, N months, N years. This gives the ability to define the interval of data that's useful to the system (which might be reloaded when there's a need), whether those segments are being marked as used or not in the metadata system. It means that data is meaningless beyond this retention period.\n2. Making the datasources configurable - list of data sources to be considered for deletion. This gives you the ability to whiyelist the datasource that you want to consider for delete instead of taking all the datasources in the system.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166676568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166685375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1990#issuecomment-166685375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1990","id":166685375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjY4NTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T17:41:49Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T17:42:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen @fjy as per the discussion I had with one of our users @premc . He wants to be able to run kill tasks automatically in production as it saves him a lot of operational headache. So, this PR changes in following ways to make it safer in production.\n\n1) kill task schedule now has its own dataSource whitelist , kill task for a dataSource is sent if and only if the dataSource exists in the whitelist. (if whitelist is null then no kill tasks are sent)\n2) added support for a property called `druid.coordinator.kill.durationToRetain` (default 1 Year), so kill task interval is set to [0, currentTime - durationToRetain].\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166685375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/166688172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1990#issuecomment-166688172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1990","id":166688172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjY4ODE3Mg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T17:47:39Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T17:47:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If
