When getting the log, get the corresponding worker according to the workerId and then get the log.\r\n\r\nWhich solution is better?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n这个问题有2种解决方案：\r\n\r\n1. 任务结束时将日志发送至S3/HDFS等分布式存储，按taskInstance id存储。新增一个LoggerService实现从分布式存储获取已完成任务的日志。\r\n2. worker.properties增加worker.id配置，taskInstance新增workerId字段。获取日志时根据workerId得到对应的worker再获取日志。\r\n\r\n哪一种方案更好？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/752056941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/752105040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/4312#issuecomment-752105040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4312","id":752105040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjEwNTA0MA==","user":{"login":"c-f-cooper","id":25735549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzM1NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25735549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper","html_url":"https://github.com/c-f-cooper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c-f-cooper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-29T14:48:54Z","updated_at":"2020-12-29T14:48:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

This means that the next time I restart the service, the port will be occupied. When I use the Kill Command, the service is normal.\r\n你好，我发现这个问题是因为端口50051被占用。\r\n我是通过使用 stop-all.sh来停止服务的，但是我发现并不是每一次1234 5678 50051都会被释放，我查看了JPS，的确是服务停止了。有时候他们似乎还在被使用着。这导致了下一次启动的时候，端口被占用。我现在每次重启都会先检查这几个端口的情况。现在DS是正常的。谢谢","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/752300320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/752305135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/4345#issuecomment-752305135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4345","id":752305135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjMwNTEzNQ==","user":{"login":"CalvinKirs","id":16631152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjMxMTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16631152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinKirs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinKirs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-30T02:29:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T02:29:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi,
