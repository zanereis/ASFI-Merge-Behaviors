Thrift to me is not as simple to use as a map, and as such developers will think twice about making changes to it.  Also any changes to it will send up flags compared to adding in a new item in a map.

Could we not just have another implementation of `IBrokerReader` and `PartitionCoordinator`, which are fairly clean interfaces. I’ve definitely found the static partition configuration helpful when debugging.\n\nThe use of the marker interface is fairly localised (`KafkaUtils.makeBrokerReader` and `KafkaSpout.open`) so I don't think it's too big a problem.\n\nIf we want to get away from the `BrokerHosts` marker interface we could add something more explicit to the `KafkaConfig` (e.g. `config.partitionSource()` which could return STATIC/ZK/KAFKA) - I think this is more a question of style rather than complexity. \n\nWhy did you remove the configuration for the batch coordinator in trident? I’ve found that quite useful when debugging. I also think that mixing trident and non trident configuration can be a bit confusing, some parameters, e.g. `stateUpdateIntervalMs` do not have a meaning in trident.\n\nThanks again!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72336141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72349915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/387#issuecomment-72349915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/387","id":72349915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzQ5OTE1","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-01T03:41:59Z","updated_at":"2015-02-01T03:41:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the suggestions, I have tried to address all the concerns below.\n- I can create multiple jiras and separate the refactoring in two parts as you suggested.\n- I did not remove PartitionCoordinator, just moved it to a package called partition where I moved all the partition management stuff. \n- I removed IBrokerReader because I felt the recommended way to get the kafka broker host is the only way we should support, like a final method that can not be overridden. The users of this connector should not care how does the connector get internal kafka information like a topics' broker->partition mapping. If others are of the opinion that we should make this extensible I can keep the interface around I personally vote against doing this. \n- I have worked on few kafka connector issues and everytime I read the code the marker interfaces and alternate configs were actually the things that made reading/understanding the code harder. I could pass an instance of tridentConfig to non trident spout and nothing would work and no compile time errors/warnings will be issued. In my opinion we should not support 3 ways to get internal kafka details,  this does not just make the code harder to read but even the documentation to use the connector gets confusing with so many different ways to achieve something that should be internal to the connector code. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72349915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72356826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/403#issuecomment-72356826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/403","id":72356826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzU2ODI2","user":{"login":"Lewuathe","id":1713047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTMwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1713047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe","html_url":"https://github.com/Lewuathe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lewuathe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-01T08:50:46Z","updated_at":"2015-02-01T08:51:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems that there is no way to install `storm-maven-plugin` in local repository before compiling `storm-core` because with `compile` phase there is no jar files enough to install.

Which messages is it counting?<br/>\nIn general, I think a mixture of network and CPU load might be a better measure (e.g., messages + idle time).</p>\n\n<p>For short term spikes, I have a question.

@Parth-Brahmbhatt ,\n\nThank you for pointing me to this pull request. I see that my pull request  https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/406 shares part of ideas with your branch  Storm 631 and think it would be nice to join the ideas in one place.\nThe main point of intersection is isolating failure-related functionality in dedicated class.\n- The difference in my approach is that I see this class plugable since logic of failure handling can differ from topology to topology. For example, I implemented case when number of retries per message is restricted.  Of course, reasonable default should be provided.  If it is pluggable, the question is how to choose and configure it. I think two main possibilities are: either with extending of KafkaConfig class, or introducing registry that stores appropriate factory. Last  approach can be better in case we speak about choosing approach per topology that works with several KafkaSpouts, listening  to different topics.\n- One more (minor) point. I would move all fail() event handling to failure handler. Your implementation divides this logic to common part located in PartitionManager class and specific one - in failure handler. I don't see conceptual cause for this division. There is a technical issue related to access level of members in PartitionManager, but this might be changed by slight PartitionManager refactoring.\n\nI'd be glad to see your feedback to these points\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72505185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72506514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/407#issuecomment-72506514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/407","id":72506514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTA2NTE0","user":{"login":"ogorun","id":490692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/490692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun","html_url":"https://github.com/ogorun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ogorun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-02T18:09:35Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T18:09:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @wurstmeister,\n\nThere is my pull request https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/406 and corresponding comments in pull request https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/387 .

I took a first-pass at the code and tested it in cluster. Here are my thoughts and nitpicks :)\n1. nimbus.min.replication.count default should be 1 . Lets consider that leader nimbus is also a replica.\nAlso can we rename this as \"topology.replication.count\" . This config affects topology replicas and specifying \"min\" in the config indicates that minimum has to be reached for the success but in this even if the min.replication is not reached topology can be deployed.\n2. nimbus.max.replication.wait.time.sec this should be higher than 0 as default. Can be renamed to \"topology.max.replication.wait.time.secs\"\n3. needs doc on how to use nimbus.min.replication.count . Either user can specify as part of toplogy config? another way is to nimbus.min.replication.count via storm jar\nexample: ./bin/storm jar examples/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT.jar storm.starter.WordCountTopology wordcount3 -c \"nimbus.min.replication.count=0\"\nI am not sure if this value being validated anywhere i.e user can pass in -1 and the topology still gets uploaded.\n4. If a user kills a topology , topology jars are not being deleted from the non-leader replica.\n5. **Improvement** we can do this in a follow-up JIRA. If a user already uploads a topology and wants to increase its replication factor. Not sure if this is required, thought it would be helpful.\n6. **Improvement** follow-up JIRA .\nTopologySummary should also contain what its replication. Helpful for admin/users to check if a topology has enough replicas.\n7. renew-credentials should happen even if nimbus is leader or not . This make sures that a non-leader nimbus still have valid ticket. In a scenario where we don't renew ticket for non-leader nimbus and ticket expires. If the leader nimbus dies , this non-leader nimbus becomes leader which is running with a expired ticket.\n8. The above should also apply to cleanup-corrupt-topologies . This might be what causing the issue mentioned in 4.\n9. Mostly a question. From the code and doc it looks to me all the clients need to call zk-leader-elector to find the leader nimbus. This is ok for clojure or java code. There can be a usecase where users want to submit a topology without using StormSubmitter, is there a way to provide a thrift api or\nsome other mechanism to discover the leader nimbus by passing in zookeeper connect string.\n\nOverall the code looks great and tested the failure scenarios during topology deployment and topology opertaions. It looks good to me.  Great work @Parth-Brahmbhatt\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72519250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612504092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4369#issuecomment-2612504092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4369","id":2612504092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MDQwOTI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-02T20:14:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:13:53Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=zhangjinlong\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"zhangjinlong\">zhangjinlong</a>,</p>\n\n<p>Sorry this took so long to get in.

In the interest of improved communication and collaboration I'd like to create a parent/umbrella JIRA that would allow us to discuss and coordinate such efforts in a central location. Creating a feature branch in the main Storm repo is also an option if it would make collaboration easier/less painful.\n\nI think the first order of business is to define (at a high level) everything we hope to accomplish, then come up with a plan for implementation.\n\nIf we're all in agreement, I'll go ahead and create the parent JIRA and get the ball rolling. How does that sound?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72533983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72536213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/387#issuecomment-72536213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/387","id":72536213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTM2MjEz","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-02T20:57:50Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T20:57:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptgoetz  Makes sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72536213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72536306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/288#issuecomment-72536306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/288","id":72536306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNTM2MzA2","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-02T20:58:21Z","updated_at":"2015-02-02T20:58:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@BuDongDong I merged this in, but because your repo was deleted the pull request is not automatically recognizing that it was pulled in.

I didn't think about the scenario where users have topologies with different replication needs but I think its a good idea to give this option so modified both the name of the config and the code.\n2. nimbus.max.replication.wait.time.sec=0, again will change the name and code so this becomes a topology level config. Also for starters updating the default value to 60 seconds.\n3. I have documented the configs and meaning as part of nimbus-ha-design in the configuration section. I will update the section to indicate the changes made in point 1 and 2.\n4. That is a new bug and I will try to reproduce it locally. The local files from nimbuses are deleted via \"clean-inbox\" thread and that thread is scheduled for non leader nimbuses as well so not really sure why this would happen.\n5. By default all nimbuses will sync-code so even if user indicates he only wants replication of n, it is  just the lower bound and if cluster has m nimbuses where m > n , all m nimbuses will replicate topology code. If by dynamically modifying the replication count you mean some API like \"Deactivate my topology and reactivate only when this replication count is achieved\" then yes we can discuss it in separate jira but my initial thought is this won't be very useful as ideally the admin should investigate why all nimbuses don't have the topology replicated.\n6. Agreed, I can do this as part of this PR only.\n7. Renew credentials thread only renews creds per topology and stores the creds for that topology in zookeeper under /storm/credentials/storm-id. I don't think it is responsible for renewing nimbus's own credentials. Given a non leader nimbus process will never use a topology credentials for any purpose and should have its own TGT for nimbus operation I am not sure if we want to enable this thread.  You already know I don't understand the storm security part well :-).  can you explain why nimbus would need topology creds?\n8. cleanup-corrupt-topology thread lists local directory and diffs it with active storm-ids. It does not cleanup local state but instead deletes the zookeeper state for missing storm-ids. This means an out of sync nimbus host can delete a perfectly working topology. I think you mean to activate the clean-inbox thread which clears the local state and that thread is already activated for non leader nimbus.\n9. As mentioned in the design doc I think a thrift API is a great idea for nimbus discovery and I plan to add them. I felt the changes I have as part of this single PR are already too big for review and it might be better to do it as part of a follow up task. Given both you and @revans2 have asked for this I am going to create a child task and submit a PR against this branch.\n\nThanks for the vagrant setup, I tried and failed to have a working multi nimbus secure setup. With your secure vagrant multi nimbus setup I can now test nimbus HA in secure environment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72604552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612523313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4491#issuecomment-2612523313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4491","id":2612523313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MjMzMTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-03T09:02:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:23:42Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

,\nThank you for pointing me to https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/254  .\nIt is definitely progress in direction of failure handling functionality encapsulation. But there are two points that I'would solve another way. \n- I feel plugable failure handler (with reasonable default) is needed. For example, I'd rather have one point in topology (spout) that decides when to stop  reprocessing the same message (for example, after configurable number of retries) than checking all possible exceptions are handled properly in every bolt.\n- fail() event is divided into two parts: one part is handled in PartitionManager class and another one in FailedMsgRetryManager. I don't see cause for such division.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72620333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/72652704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/268#issuecomment-72652704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/268","id":72652704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjUyNzA0","user":{"login":"miguno","id":294849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno","html_url":"https://github.com/miguno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-03T13:48:39Z","updated_at":"2015-02-03T22:23:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Some additional feedback regarding Storm's behavior in the face of failures, with and without this patch.  This summary is slightly simplified to make it a shorter read.\n\n### Without this patch\n- Tested Storm versions: 0.9.2, 0.9.3, 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT\n- Configuration: default Storm settings (cf. `conf/defaults.yaml`)\n\nHere, we can confirm the cascading failure previously described in this pull request and the JIRA ticket.\n\nConsider a simple topology such as:\n\n```\n                +-----> bolt1 -----> bolt2\n                |\n     spout -----+\n                |\n                +-----> bolt3\n```\n- If the instances of `bolt2` die (say, because of a runtime exception), then `bolt1` instances will enter a reconnect-until-success-or-die loop.\n  - If Storm decides to place the restarted `bolt2` instances on different workers (read: machine+port pairs), then `bolt1` will eventually die.\n  - If Storm places the restarted `bolt2` instances on the same workers, then the `bolt1` instances will not die because one of their reconnection attempts will succeed, and normal operation will resume.\n- If `bolt1` died, too, then we enter the same reconnect-until-success-or-die loop in the `spout` instances.  Hence the cascading nature of the failure.\n\nOn top of that, we also noticed the following, later phases of this cascading failure to occur in larger clusters, where each phase is less likely to happen than the previous one:\n1. Other spouts/bolts of the same topology -- \"friends of friends\" and so on -- may enter such loops.  In the example above, `bolt3` may start to die, too.\n2. Eventually the full topology may become disfunctional, a zombie: not dead but not alive either.\n3. Other topologies in the cluster may then become zombies, too.\n4. The full Storm cluster may enter a zombie state.  This state even turn out to be unrecoverable without a full cluster restart.\n\n> Funny anecdote: Because of a race condition scenario you may even observe that Storm spouts/bolts will begin to talk to the wrong peers, e.g. `spout` will talk directly to `bolt2`, even though this violates the wiring of our topology.\n\n### With this patch\n- Tested Storm versions: We primarily tested a patched 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT version but also tested a patched 0.9.3 briefly.\n- Configuration: default Storm settings (cf. `conf/defaults.yaml`)\n\nHere, the behavior is different.  We didn't observe cascading failures anymore at the expense of \"silent data loss\" (see below).\n\nAgain, consider this example topology:\n\n```\n                +-----> bolt1 -----> bolt2\n                |\n     spout -----+\n                |\n                +-----> bolt3\n```\n\nWith the patch, when the instances of `bolt2` die then the instances of `bolt1` will continue to run; i.e. they will not enter a reconnect-until-success-or-die loop anymore (which, particularly the not-dying part, was the purpose of the patch).  However, the restarted `bolt2` instances would not process new input tuples until `52 mins` later, and we found `52 mins` to be a consistent value.  During this hour of inactivity there were no errors reported in the logs or in the UI/metrics, the only telling sign was that `bolt2` didn't report any processed tuples (read: `0` executed/acked/transferred) during these 52 minutes.\n\n**bolt2 behavior (the bolt that started the failure)**\n\nWe wrote a special-purpose \"storm-bolt-of-death\" topology that would consistently throw runtime exceptions in `bolt2` (aka the bolt of death) whenever it receives an input tuple.  The following example shows the timeline of `bolt2` crashing intentionally.  We observed that once the `bolt2` instances were restarted -- and Storm would typically restart the instances on the same workers (read: machine+port combinations) -- then they would not receive any new input tuples even though their upstream peer `bolt1` was up and running and constantly emitting output tuples.\n\nSummary of the `bolt2` log snippet below:\n- This `bolt2` instance died at `12:49:21`, followed by an immediate restart (here: on the same machine+port).\n- The `bolt2` instance was up and running again at `12:49:32`, but it would not process any new input tuple until `52 mins` later.\n  - In our testing we found that the restarted `bolt2` instances took a consistent `52 mins` (!) to receive their first, \"new\" input tuple from `bolt1`.\n\n```\n# New input tuple => let's crash!   Now the shutdown procedure begins.\n\n2015-02-03 12:49:21 c.v.s.t.s.b.BoltOfDeath [ERROR] Intentionally throwing this exception to trigger bolt failures\n2015-02-03 12:49:21 b.s.util [ERROR] Async

Here is an example log snippet of `bolt1` at the time when `bolt2` died (`ForwarderBolt` is `bolt1`).\n- `bolt1` complains about a failed connection to a `bolt2` instance (`supervisor3:6702`) at `12:52:24`, which is about `3 mins` after the `bolt2` instance died `12:49:21`.  Also, the restarted `bolt2` instance reported that it was up and running again at `12:49:32` on `supervisor3:6702`.\n  - `3 mins` might be due to the default TCP connection timeout on Linux.  The test machines were running kernel `2.6.32-358.2.1.el6.x86_64` (RHEL6.4), with a `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries` setting of `5`.  According to [this document](http://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7010211) the default timeout behavior was changed in kernel 2.6.32 from a static default timeout of 180s = 3mins to a formula-based timeout that results in ~23s.  So maybe the kernel on the test machines was actually still using the old timeout method, and the \"failed connection\" log entry was due to a TCP timeout.  If that assumption is true, then what we see here is that `bolt1`'s original TCP connection to `bolt2` (before the latter died) was timing out, and behind the scenes the restarted `bolt2` was waiting for new connections on the old TCP port.\n- `bolt1` subsequently reports it re-established a connection to `bolt2` at `12:52:24` (the log timestamp granularity is 1 second).\n  - `bolt1` reports 9 new output tuples but - if my understanding of the new patch is correct - this happens asynchronously now.\n- `bolt1` complains about another failed connection to `bolt2` at `12:52:25` on `supervisor3:6702` (and another connection failure to a second instance of `bolt2` at `12:52:26` on `supervisor4:6702`).\n- `bolt1` would then report new output tuples, but those would not reach the

Hence the cascading nature of the failure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    On top of that, we also noticed the following, later phases of this cascading failure to occur in larger clusters, where each phase is less likely to happen than the previous one:</p>\n\n<p>    1. Other spouts/bolts of the same topology &#8211; \"friends of friends\" and so on &#8211; may enter such loops.  In the example above, `bolt3` may start to die, too.<br/>\n    2. Eventually the full topology may become disfunctional, a zombie: not dead but not alive either.<br/>\n    3. Other topologies in the cluster may then become zombies, too.<br/>\n    4. The full Storm cluster may enter a zombie state.  This state even turn out to be unrecoverable without a full cluster restart.</p>\n\n<p>    > Funny anecdote: Because of a race condition scenario you may even observe that Storm spouts/bolts will begin to talk to the wrong peers, e.g. `spout` will talk directly to `bolt2`, even though this violates the wiring of our topology.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t<li>With this patch</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tested Storm versions: We primarily tested a patched 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT version but also tested a patched 0.9.3 briefly.</li>\n\t<li>Configuration: default Storm settings (cf. `conf/defaults.yaml`)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    Here, the behavior is different.  We didn't observe cascading failures anymore at the expense of \"silent data loss\" (see below).</p>\n\n<p>    Again, consider this example topology:</p>\n\n<p>    ```<br/>\n    +-----> bolt1 -----> bolt2</p>\n<div class='table-wrap'>\n<table class='confluenceTable'><tbody>\n<tr>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p> spout -----+</p>\n<div class='table-wrap'>\n<table class='confluenceTable'><tbody>\n<tr>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>    +-----> bolt3<br/>\n    ```</p>\n\n<p>    With the patch, when the instances of `bolt2` die then the instances of `bolt2` will continue to run; i.e. they will not enter a reconnect-until-success-or-die loop anymore (which, particularly the not-dying part, was the purpose of the patch).</p>\n\n<p>    *<b>bolt2 behavior</b>*</p>\n\n<p>    We wrote a special-purpose \"storm-bolt-of-death\" topology that would consistently throw runtime exceptions in `bolt2` (aka the bolt of death) whenever it receives an input tuple.  The following example shows the timeline of `bolt2` crashing intentionally.  We observed that once the `bolt2` instances were restarted &#8211; and Storm would typically restart the instances on the same workers (read: machine+port combinations) &#8211; then they would not receive any new input tuples even though their upstream peer `bolt2` was up and running and constantly emitting output tuples.</p>\n\n<p>    Summary of the `bolt2` log snippet below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This `bolt2` instance dies at `12:49:21`, followed by an immediate restart (here: on the same machine+port).</li>\n\t<li>The `bolt2` instance is up and running at `12:49:32`, but it would not process any new input tuple until `52 mins` later.</li>\n\t<li>In our testing we found that the restarted `bolt2` instances took a consistent `52 mins` <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/warning.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/> to receive their first, \"new\" input tuple from `bolt1`.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    ```</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>New input tuple => let's crash!   Now the shutdown procedure begins.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>    2015-02-03 12:49:21 c.v.s.t.s.b.BoltOfDeath <span class=\"error\">&#91;ERROR&#93;</span> Intentionally throwing this exception to trigger

the most part it looks OK.  I am concerned about a few of the APIs seem confusing to me and could use some better javadocs.  Also I am concerned with the performance of some of the sql involved.  We are regenerating a lot of the sql from text for each query.  I am not a sql expert, but I thought that the idea behind prepared statements was that it made it so the sql engine did not have to reparse and compile the query each time.  I'm not sure how each server does that internally, but the fact that we are doing string manipulation for each query instead of once when the bolt is prepared, seems problematic.\n\nAlso the Columns magic we are doing seems OK, but like I said I am not a SQL expert and it feels like just using a stored query would be a lot simpler then all of this.
