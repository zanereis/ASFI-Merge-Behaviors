We are already close to RC on 4.6(once 4.5.2 is done) and cannot afford regressions at this stage.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/133406706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/133407337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/689#issuecomment-133407337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/689","id":133407337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMzQwNzMzNw==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-21T12:21:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-21T12:21:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DaanHoogland in addition to failing to convey the intention of the action, the open then close pattern is incredibly expensive due to rapid, unnecessary churn on the connection pool.
