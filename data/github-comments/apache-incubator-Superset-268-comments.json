The advice of the @zhouyao1994 helped me. Actually, I was not doing anything else, other than applying the commands suggested by @zhouyao1994.\r\n\r\n* However, in my case by the very first installation of the VM I used not that much resources. My VM - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, installed via vagrant on Windows host. \r\n* Then I added more resources to the VM (RAM - 4 Gb, CPU - 2x), but still experienced the same problem. \r\n* Then I increased size of the swap to 1GB, as it was suggested [here](http://www.inanzzz.com/index.php/post/gz4x/preventing-composer-crash-in-vagrant-proc-open-fork-failed-cannot-allocate-memory). \r\n* But even after adding more resources, the installation didn't succeed. \r\n* Then I restarted VM, stopped all containers, and removed them via ```sudo docker system prune``` and made sure that all previous containers were removed.\r\n* Then navigated to the ```<YOUR-PATH>/incubator-superset/contrib/docker/``` and run ```sudo docker-compose run -e SUPERSET_LOAD_EXAMPLES=yes --rm superset ./docker-init.sh``` (as suggested by @zhouyao1994). And after waiting for a while and typing in admin login the installation was successfully completed!\r\n* As the last step, I run the containers manually via ```sudo docker-compose up``` \r\n\r\nI hope it helps you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/559146183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/559150990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8651#issuecomment-559150990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8651","id":559150990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTE1MDk5MA==","user":{"login":"tcopple","id":619743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTc0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/619743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple","html_url":"https://github.com/tcopple","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcopple/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T16:06:52Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T16:06:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yea, I pulled a previous tag and things were fine.

So we could have one role: **Company A**, who has the clause `company_id=12`\r\nAnd another role: **Last 30 days**, who has the clause `date_field > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)`\r\n\r\nAnd for a specific user of **Company A**, if they should only be able to see the last 30 days worth of data, apply both roles.\r\n\r\nSince a row level security filter's clause is arbitrary, it can also support multiple conditions: `client_id = 6 AND advertiser=\"foo\"`, etc.  You can throw whatever you want in there to define the subset of the table you want the role in question to have access to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/559903928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
