Our definition (the way I implemented it) expects the ranges to match the actual sizes of the matrices on the workers. And the actual size of the federated matrix goes from (0,0) to (max row, max col) given in the ranges, making it therefore not possible to get 0 rows and 0 cols after our ranges are finished.

Thanks.\r\n\r\ncurrently this pr is on a hold, because of multiple reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The intention was to implement a function and use it in the compression planning as well, so that we have more granularity in our estimations, and not relying only on the current compression sample estimators. Therefore i want to make the compression planning accurate first without estimations before coming back to these estimation algorithms.\r\n2. The accuracy achieved with the current implementation of KMV so far achieves worse estimates than the ShlosserJackKnifeestimator inside the compression.\r\n3.

overall this is great @Baunsgaard. During the merge, I just fixed a few typos, and minor warnings (generics, static methods).\r\n\r\nThanks @mboehm7  for the fixes :+1:, our editors detect different things, so I think it is a fine trade-off unless it required significant changes :smile:.\r\n\r\n> Additionally, you might want to consider moving the `ColGroupSizes` into the class hierarchy of column groups to avoid string-based dispatching (including abstract classes that could never be instantiated) and bring this closer to their implementation. \r\n\r\nYes I could move it back into the specific ColGroup classes, but the important thing is that they are static methods, not requiring you to construct an object of the ColGroup to calculate the sizes. Therefore I had some difficulties because static methods if can't be overwritten in java. Therefore I decided to have the logic separated into another class, instead of having \"Semi Random\" names for getting size of objects inside the individual classes. I hope you have a better suggestion, because I two do not like the ColGroupSizes class as it is now.\r\n\r\n>Also, please reconsider the unnecessary indirection of `AbstractCompressedMatrixBlock` and `CompressedMatrixBlockFactory`. Is there any intention behind them other than splitting `CompressedMatrixBlock` into smaller files?\r\n\r\nThe reason was that I wanted to make an LossyMatrixBlock object, that also pointed to the abstract CompressedMatrixBlock, such that we had the option to select compression also based on Object type. I did this before our discussion on keeping everything colocated inside CompressedMatrixBlock,  but while adding the lossy compression logic I will reconsider what could be smartest. That said, i 100% agree that the separation right now is unnecessary.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/619542266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/619546245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/892#issuecomment-619546245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/892","id":619546245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTU0NjI0NQ==","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-26T13:02:48Z","updated_at":"2020-04-26T13:02:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, Many thanks @juliale-15 :100:.\r\nAbsolutely great first addition!

Since (1) has already been introduced (see https://github.com/apache/systemml/commit/4a822a22c88b579e935a1b09051c1fe236e18a4b) and meanwhile we extended the list functionality to pass parameters easier along function call graphs, there is no more a real need for globals.

Similarly, I brought the read from federated frames into the same form as federated matrices. Finally, there were some minor issues such as code duplication (parsing of strings to value-type-specific objects), unnecessary imports, and missing static modifiers of methods which don't access class members.

Thanks for the patch @phaniarnab - I think this is a great direction.

Down the road, it would be good to further generalize the different eviction policies to better separate the different code paths (otherwise, it would get complex and convoluted very quickly) - I left a TODO in `makeSpace`.

Overall, this is a great start. During the merge, I fixes the licenses (wrong/missing) and did some minor cleanups. There some issues though.
