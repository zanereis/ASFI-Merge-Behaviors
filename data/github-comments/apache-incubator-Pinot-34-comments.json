It really helps. In our use cases, the client first wanted to use \"1 week\" as the bucket size or granularity. When they found out it did not work because 'week' is not supported, they switched to use 7 days (probably without understanding the semantics). So the ideal fix is to make **week** work as a legit bucket unit because alignment by calendar weeks is more intuitive to users. Is it possible to do it? Otherwise, we can spell out the plausible combinations of parameters in this UDF[doc](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/wiki/dateTimeConvert-UDF) -- I guess the users find 1:WEEKS there.  \r\n\r\nAs for fixing the issue with the granularity in terms of  **days**, I would say both (1) and (2) are fine as long as we define it clearly in the same UDF doc. As far as I know, there is no well known notion about how to align a general N days bucket: so most of users can accept a definition and decide if it works for them. (3) is not working for us in this case because our users do want to the Pinot feature to convert the time to a local timezone (e.g, Chicago).

In case of outputFormat in EPOCH, the bucketing can just be done in epoch weeks. But if output is in SDF, we have many options\r\n\r\n- If we start bucketing from epoch start, January 1st 1970 was a Thursday, so all buckets would be starting Thursday. \r\n- If we want a calendar alignment, should we start Monday/Sunday?\r\n- If we keep current behavior, days 1-7 would align with bucket yyyyMM01, days 8-14 with yyyyMM08 and so on. The number of week buckets in a year will not equal to 52 in this case, as we will have a half bucket created for every month's last few days.\r\n\r\nI prefer option 1, seems the most predictable and clean approach. We can also make all bucketing follow this. No resetting buckets at boundaries (DAYS should not reset at month, HOURS should not reset on days). But this would mean, you will not get a calendar alignment, and would have to offset your date if you need it aligned to the calendar.\r\n\r\n@kishoreg @mayankshriv please provide your suggestions if possible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/440402832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/440454749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/3515#issuecomment-440454749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3515","id":440454749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDQ1NDc0OQ==","user":{"login":"chenboat","id":2549137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2549137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat","html_url":"https://github.com/chenboat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenboat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T22:39:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T22:39:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @Jackie-Jiang and @snleee for the quick replies.

The per-partition checkpoint requirement could be satisfied, but the notion of an offset may be a problem.   How central is the notion of offset, could it be factored out as an implementation detail of the consumer?\r\n\r\nAlternatively one could target the high-level stream consumer interface.   I don't understand what the tradeoff would be.  I also don't understand how checkpoints work in the high-level API; does Pinot expect a global checkpoint or a per-indexer checkpoint?\r\n\r\nThanks for any insights!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/442703012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/442704522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/3528#issuecomment-442704522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3528","id":442704522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjcwNDUyMg==","user":{"login":"snleee","id":27253407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjUzNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27253407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee","html_url":"https://github.com/snleee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-29T04:42:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T04:44:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When I tried to limit the bloom filter size to 1MB (by computing max false positive using formale), I found that clear spring implementation does not behave as expected for the cases when we have high cardinality while Guava implementation is working as expected.
