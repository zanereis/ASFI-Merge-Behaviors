"> @KevinJohn-GH I'm sorry to say that it's difficult to get the process instance id immediately when you start a new process. Because the process instance id is asynchronously generated by the component of Master. Maybe you could get the last running process instance id through the api like 'http://localhost:3000/dolphinscheduler/projects/3655870219936/process-instances?pageNo=1&pageSize=10&processDefineCode=4940490003842'.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity，but thanks for your reply
