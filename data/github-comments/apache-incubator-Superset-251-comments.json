Is that not correct?\r\n\r\nAs is, this PR handles mixed GeoJSON polygon types (Polygon + MultiPolygon) dynamically and will determine the type of GeoJSON polygon before processing it. Any other GeoJSON types will simply not render -- I've tested Point, MultiPoint, LineString, and MultiLineString data to prove this out. Perhaps an error message pointing users to the GeoJSON chart type would be helpful if a user is trying to render Point/MultiPoint/LineString data in the polygon chart?\r\n\r\nI also tested `null` geometry values and they do not render as well. I will work on adding error handling for those as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/528550812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/528635022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8081#issuecomment-528635022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8081","id":528635022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODYzNTAyMg==","user":{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T23:04:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T23:04:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks

idea of `assert_viz_permission` in `SecurityManager` makes sense and I understand why you'd do that.\r\n\r\nThe only concern is whether the BaseViz interface is settled enough to expose externally through SecurityManager. `assert_query_context_permission` exposes less surface which is preferable. Taping into the viz object offers lots of flexibility, but little guarantee as to whether you hooks will still work after you upgrade...\r\n\r\nThere's another underlying issue I'd like to fix, it's the fact that `check_datasource_perms` is called from a decorator and recreates a BaseViz object that gets thrown away and recreated later on. Decorators are cool and all, but a clear shortcoming is how it gets ugly in cases like this (context need to be shared across decorator and function body). We need to de-decorate that function and do things right.\r\n\r\nAlso we should clarify if these security assertions call each other or, the view calls them individually/sequentially. It works either way, but what's important is having something super intuitive and readable. Currently there's quite a bit of indirection (the decorator with the callback + a complex method hierarchy) and it's hard to reason about and easy to eff this up and introduce some regression.\r\n\r\nKnowing all this, what we want to accomplish:\r\n* deprecate restricted metrics\r\n* de-decorate security assertions\r\n* have a set of comprehensive data access assertion in security manager (clear score and hierarchy, consistent naming, clarity on what is private/public), comments on places where interfaces may change (override at your own risk!)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to roll this out best, but a chain of small PRs is probably best. \r\n\r\nAbout restricted metrics, you could start partially deprecating here by not trying to migrate the code, idk how involved deprecating the feature will be, but shouldn't be too hard.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/529298194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/529300796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8175#issuecomment-529300796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8175","id":529300796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTMwMDc5Ng==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T05:03:17Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T05:03:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I was curious to give deprecation of restricted metrics a shot and it took me ~15 minutes to get to this draft: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8197","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/529300796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/529308750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7336#issuecomment-529308750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7336","id":529308750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTMwODc1MA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T05:45:21Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T05:45:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
