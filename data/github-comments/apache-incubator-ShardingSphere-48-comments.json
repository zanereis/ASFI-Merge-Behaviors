As you know the leaf generator needs zookeeper client to communicate with zookeeper server. So the way of initializing the zookeeper client is a little hard to decide. Although, initializing the client and the definition of the client has been implemented in 'package org.apache.shardingsphere.orchestration.reg'. But it is hard to use them directly,.Beacuse the key generator is in 'package org.apache.shardingsphere.core.strategy.keygen'. So I'm planning to write these part on my own to initialize the client and the related functions.\r\n\r\nI prefer the agree your point, because reg module is for orchestration only, not for sharding-core, so just copy some core codes to leaf plugin is fine.\r\n\r\n> 2. The property of the leaf segment generator, especially zookeeper client related.I'd like to use new parameter，this means orchestration register related parameter won't be used.\r\n\r\n Yes, it should use new parameters, and we can put them to properties to let leaf plugin to read them.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/492958293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/492958742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2391#issuecomment-492958742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2391","id":492958742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Mjk1ODc0Mg==","user":{"login":"haj8888888","id":15724396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzI0Mzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15724396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888","html_url":"https://github.com/haj8888888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haj8888888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T07:50:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T07:50:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I found the root cause is that the actual SQLs cross databases.

Sharding-Proxy\r\n\r\nExpect behavior:\r\nSharding-proxy should be compatible with mysql 5.6 legacy timestamp field .\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nrunning sharding-proxy with  mysql 5.6 legacy timestamp field (value = '0000-00-00 00:00:00') got follow error.\r\n Error:\r\n Value '0000-00-00 00:00:00' can not be represented as java.sql.Timestamp\r\n\r\nReason analyze\r\n  Mysql 5.6 allows timestamp field  with default value '0000-00-00 00:00:00', and it seems the proxy can not convert value '0000-00-00 00:00:00' to a java Timestamp.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE `tb_user_info_0` (\r\n  `USER_CODE` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n  `CREATE_TIME` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',\r\n  `UPDATE_TIME` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\r\n  `USER_NAME` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`USER_CODE`)\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE `tb_user_info_1` (\r\n  `USER_CODE` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n  `CREATE_TIME` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',\r\n  `UPDATE_TIME` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\r\n  `USER_NAME` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`USER_CODE`)\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO `tb_user_info_0` (`USER_CODE`, `CREATE_TIME`, `UPDATE_TIME`, `USER_NAME`)\r\nVALUES ('0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2019-05-16 15:11:02', 'Bob');\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO `tb_user_info_1` (`USER_CODE`, `CREATE_TIME`, `UPDATE_TIME`, `USER_NAME`)\r\nVALUES ('1', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2019-05-16 14:44:41', 'Alice');\r\n\r\n# config-sharding-test.yaml\r\nschemaName: test\r\n\r\ndataSources:\r\n  ds_0:\r\n    url: jdbc:mysql://172.16.4.253:3306/test?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false\r\n    username: aaa\r\n    password: bbb\r\n    connectionTimeoutMilliseconds: 30000\r\n    idleTimeoutMilliseconds: 60000\r\n    maxLifetimeMilliseconds: 1800000\r\n    maxPoolSize: 50\r\n\r\nshardingRule:\r\n  tables:\r\n    tb_user_info:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds_0.tb_user_info_${0..1}\r\n      tableStrategy:\r\n        inline:\r\n          shardingColumn: USER_CODE\r\n          algorithmExpression: tb_user_info_${Integer.parseInt(USER_CODE.substring(USER_CODE.length() - 1)) % 2}\r\n      keyGenerator:\r\n        type: SNOWFLAKE\r\n        column: USER_CODE\r\n  bindingTables:\r\n    - tb_user_info\r\n  defaultDatabaseStrategy:\r\n    none:\r\n  defaultTableStrategy:\r\n    none:\r\n\r\nSQL:\r\nselect * from tb_user_info;\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/492981111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/492982534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2389#issuecomment-492982534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2389","id":492982534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Mjk4MjUzNA==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T09:01:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T09:05:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"How do you execute the SQL(select * from tb_user_info;)?\r\nMySQL command line, MySQL GUI or JDBC?
