For example, it doesn't really make sense to allow \"custom IOPS\" and now we prevent that if you try to create a system offering as such.\n\n2) If you transition managed storage into maintenance mode and system VMs were running on that managed storage, the host-side clustered file systems (SRs on XenServer) were not removed. This is not a big issue since putting a managed storage like a SAN in maintenance mode is not too likely.\n\nI added a call to a method that removes these client-side file systems, if you're using managed storage. In the event of any failure here, I catch the exception, print an error message to the log, and allow the storage-cleanup thread to continue its tasks.\n\n3) I added an extensive set of tests with regards to system VMs on managed storage.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247892752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247913244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1643#issuecomment-247913244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1643","id":247913244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzkxMzI0NA==","user":{"login":"abhinandanprateek","id":12134381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM0Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12134381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek","html_url":"https://github.com/abhinandanprateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinandanprateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T05:24:23Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T05:24:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jburwell should i open a new PR for 4.8 branch ?

UI used dictionary, dictionary2 and index jsp files.\n\nThe dictionary jsp files simply added a dictionary (java script object or map) by reading through messages properties for various translations. Replacing them was easy, we added a python script (`tools/transifex/gen-l10n.py`) that would generate js files (at build time) by reading through the `messages` files such that the generated dictionary (object or map) would be exactly same as what the jsp files did.\n\nThe `index.jsp` file primarily did two things: (1) include dictionary, dictionary2 jsp files, (2) used them for translating strings. By replacing the dictionary jsp files with auto-generated translation js file based on a `lang` cookie exactly the same dictionary object was still accessible to the index.jsp file. All the translated strings in index.jsp were replaced with a new/custom `DOM` element `<translate key=\"some.key\">`, and some code was added that would process and add text to this new dom element based on the translation key set. Replacement of `<fmt:` code with `<translate>` was done with a search/replace operation. By adding a new custom `DOM` element, no CSS changes were required. The translation was done by this method: https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack/blob/26b591f225abbee8690c20af914f8e37103043ef/ui/index.html#L1746\n\nThe only exception were `select` dropdowns, where translation was done explicitly by getting the DOM element and injecting `options` as seen here:\nhttps://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack/blob/26b591f225abbee8690c20af914f8e37103043ef/ui/index.html#L1766\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247925126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247926237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1639#issuecomment-247926237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1639","id":247926237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzkyNjIzNw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T07:26:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T07:26:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@abhinandanprateek yes, click on `edit` on your PR you should be able to change the base branch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247926237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/247926860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1511#issuecomment-247926860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1511","id":247926860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzkyNjg2MA==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T07:30:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T07:30:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jburwell these are major changes so they need to go into master, targetting 4.10, or 4.11.
