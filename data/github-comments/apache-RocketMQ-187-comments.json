Hello @zergduan , please refer to: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/g_CUAXrzQ1TQhIDrhX-zkw\r\n\r\n感谢您的回复，我参考了您提供的内容找到了问题原因：\r\n\r\n问题1.\r\n当 mqadmin 客户端是 NameServer 和 Broker 时（非RocketMQ集群中的节点）, mqadmin listacl 可以正常返回结果；\r\n当 mqadmin 客户端不是 NameServer 和 Broker 时（非RocketMQ集群中的节点）, mqadmin listacl 返回报错 org.apache.rocketmq.acl.common.AclException: No acl config for rocketmq\r\n\r\n结论：\r\n因为我的Broker参数中同时启用了 ACL 1.0 和 ACL 2.0，如下：\r\naclEnable=true\r\nauthenticationEnabled = true\r\n并且ACL 1.0配置文件plain_acl.yml中将broker和nameserver节点设置到白名单中，且 rocketmq 这个用户并不存在于 plain_acl.yml中；目前测试已知当 ACL 1.0 和 2.0 同时启用时，有如下行为：\r\na. 认证过程同时参考 ACL 1.0 和 2.0 的配置，即：\r\n当mqadmin客户端在ACL 1.0 白名单中时，可以通过认证；当mqadmin客户端不在ACL 1.0的白名单且用户名不存在于ACL1.0的account中，但是用户名存在于在ACL 2.0配置中时，也可以完成认证。\r\nb. 鉴权过程优先使用 ACL 1.0，即：\r\n当访问用户名在ACL 2.0存在ACL配置，但是此用户名在 ACL 1.0 中不存在 ACL 配置时，此用户无法通过鉴权，会报错 No acl config for <用户名>；也就是说ACL 1.0的配置优先进行鉴权，当鉴权失败后，不会再进行ACL 2.0的鉴权。\r\n\r\n问题2.\r\ninitAuthenticationUser 和 innerClientAuthenticationCredentials 有什么区别？ 在使用上有什么不同？\r\n\r\n结论：\r\ninitAuthenticationUser 仅设置于 Broker中，它随Broker启动被创建，默认super类型（最高权限），即此配置为服务端配置；\r\ninnerClientAuthenticationCredentials 设置于 Broker 和 Proxy 中，即此配置为客户端配置，当 Broker 和 Proxy 访问集群中其它Broker时，将发送这个信息（AK/SK），访问Broker收到此信息后将与ACL配置中的用户对比来完成认证和鉴权。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2403826076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2404643103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/8806#issuecomment-2404643103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/8806","id":2404643103,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86PU_Ef","user":{"login":"humkum","id":50660789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjYwNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50660789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum","html_url":"https://github.com/humkum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/humkum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-10T10:00:18Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T10:00:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You

Did you check out this ? https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-nodejs/tree/master\n> \n> \n\nThank you, I hope to get your help live, I'll add what I know:\n\nI deployed rocketmq version 5.3.0 using docker-compose with NameServe, Broker and Rocketmq-Proxy for grpc protocol support.\n\nI used the client from the nodejs version of the client from Apache's official repository (rocketmq-client).\n\n\nI followed the documentation for the nodejs client to create a consumer persistence method and a production message method.\n\nAt first it was working fine and the persistence was running for about 2~3 minutes with this error I mentioned.\n\nI realized that the error is coming from the server side and not the client side, it seems to be an error message coming back from the broker/proxy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2408570819/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2408753190","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/5835#issuecomment-2408753190","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5835","id":2408753190,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86Pkqgm","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-13T00:10:41Z","updated_at":"2024-10-13T00:10:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

The performance loss is not related to prefetching. The schedule message deliver speed is 160/s because every time the iterator only returns 16 messages, and the deliver thread will sleep 100ms after iterate finish. See org.apache.rocketmq.broker.schedule.ScheduleMessageService.DeliverDelayedMessageTimerTask#executeOnTimeUp\r\n\r\n1. The original implementation uses one-shot(at most 16 results) multi-get to simulate iterator; The outcome iterator fails to return all results, thus, does not fit well for the mentioned use case;\r\n2. You change is to use lazy single get to iterate; and use potential pre-fetch to accelerate;\r\n3. A third option is to directly wrap RocksIterator with prefix;\r\n\r\nIt would be best to make further comparisons in terms of performance(why multi-get at present), code maintenance, ...\r\nAfter all pros and cons are clarified, we may finalize this pull request.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is option 2, aka, this pull request, changes original behavior.
