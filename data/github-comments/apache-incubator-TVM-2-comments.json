The main limits of your code come from 1) the shared memory you allocate per block is too much that leads to limited concurrent blocks, and 2) the memory access pattern is not efficient enough (load/store efficiency). The low efficiency may result from the fact that NCHW is not a good memory layout to do the convolution efficiently. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/312988635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/313161525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/219#issuecomment-313161525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/219","id":313161525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzE2MTUyNQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-05T16:51:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T16:51:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"need to build with llvm enabled, otherwise it will compile with stackvm and cannot be dumped","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/313161525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/313162263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/176#issuecomment-313162263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/176","id":313162263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzE2MjI2Mw==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-05T16:53:42Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T16:53:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"jar reduces to 570k for osx-cpu.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/313162263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/313404473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/197#issuecomment-313404473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/197","id":313404473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzQwNDQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-06T14:00:09Z","updated_at":"2017-07-06T14:00:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wetliu I try dividing large image into blcoks, e.g. 96x96 into 4 blocks of 48x48.

Use TVM to Generate Javascript Library\r\n\r\nThe general idea is to use TVM as normally and set target to be ```llvm -target=asmjs-unknown-emscripten -system-lib```.\r\n\r\nThe following code snippet from [tests/web/prepare_test_libs.py](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/tests/web/prepare_test_libs.py) demonstrate\r\nthe compilation process.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import emscripten\r\nimport os\r\ndef prepare_test_libs(base_path):\r\n    target = \"llvm -target=asmjs-unknown-emscripten -system-lib\"\r\n    if not tvm.module.enabled(target):\r\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Target %s is not enbaled\" % target)\r\n    n = tvm.var(\"n\")\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((n,), name='A')\r\n    B = tvm.compute(A.shape, lambda *i: A(*i) + 1.0, name='B')\r\n    s = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\n    fadd1 = tvm.build(s, [A, B], target, name=\"add_one\")\r\n    obj_path = os.path.join(base_path, \"test_add_one.bc\")\r\n    fadd1.save(obj_path)\r\n    emscripten.create_js(os.path.join(base_path, \"test_module.js\"), obj_path)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    curr_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser(__file__)))\r\n    prepare_test_libs(os.path.join(curr_path, \"../../lib\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this workflow, we use TVM to generate a ```.bc``` file and statically link\r\nthat with the  ```lib/libtvm_web_runtime.bc```(emscripten.create_js will help you do that).\r\nThe result js library is a library that contains both TVM runtime and the compiled function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Run the Generated Library\r\n\r\nThe following code snippet from [tests/web/test_module_load.js](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/tests/web/test_module_load.js) demonstrate\r\nhow to run the compiled library.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Load Emscripten Module, need to change path to root/lib\r\nconst path = require(\"path\");\r\nprocess.chdir(path.join(__dirname, \"../../lib\"));\r\nvar Module = require(\"../../lib/test_module.js\");\r\n// Bootstrap TVMruntime with emscripten module.\r\nconst tvm_runtime = require(\"../../web/tvm_runtime.js\");\r\nconst tvm = tvm_runtime.create(Module);\r\n\r\n// Load system library, the compiled functions is registered in sysLib.\r\nvar sysLib = tvm.systemLib();\r\n\r\nfunction randomArray(length, max) {\r\n  return Array.apply(null, Array(length)).map(function() {\r\n    return Math.random() * max;\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction testAddOne() {\r\n  // grab pre-loaded function\r\n  var faddOne = sysLib.getFunction(\"add_one\");\r\n  tvm.assert(tvm.isPackedFunc(faddOne));\r\n  var n = 124;\r\n  var A = tvm.empty(n).copyFrom(randomArray(n, 1));\r\n  var B = tvm.empty(n);\r\n  // call the function.\r\n  faddOne(A, B);\r\n  // verify\r\n  for (var i = 0; i < B.length; ++i) {\r\n    tvm.assert(B[i] == A[i] + 1);\r\n  }\r\n  faddOne.release();\r\n}\r\n\r\ntestAddOne();\r\nsysLib.release();\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/314293182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/315389972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/212#issuecomment-315389972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/212","id":315389972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTM4OTk3Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T15:31:03Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T15:31:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Remove

tried to visualize the output of ElemOffset https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/lang/buffer.cc#L38. I find that in some situations, we can optimize the index calculation. For example, the following three indexings are equivalent:\r\n```C++\r\n// Format0\r\nfor (i0, 0, m)\r\n   for (i1, 0, n * k)\r\n      ind = (i0 * n + i1 % n) * k + i1 / n\r\n// Equivalent Format1\r\nfor (i0, 0, m)\r\n   for (i1, 0, n * k)\r\n      ind = (i0 * n + i1 / k) * k + i1 % k\r\n// Equivalent Format2\r\nfor (i0, 0, m)\r\n   for (i1, 0, n * k)\r\n      ind = i0 * n * k + i1\r\n```\r\nConverting from Format1 to Format2 will be easier than converting from Format0 to Format2, because the latter conversion will require the knowledge of the range of the IterVal (n*k in the example).\r\n\r\nHowever, I find that the fusing will generate the indexing form of Format0. For example:\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nm = tvm.var('m')\r\nn = tvm.var('n')\r\nk = tvm.var('k')\r\nA = tvm.placeholder((m, n, k), name='A')\r\nT = tvm.compute((m, n, k), lambda *args: A[args], name='B')\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule(T.op)\r\nfused_nk = s[T].fuse(s[T].op.axis[2], s[T].op.axis[1])\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [A], simple_mode=True))\r\n```\r\nwill generate\r\n```log\r\nproduce B {\r\n  for (i0, 0, m) {\r\n    for (i1.i2.fused, 0, (k*n)) {\r\n      B[((((i0*n) + (i1.i2.fused % n))*k) + (i1.i2.fused/n))] = A[((((i0*n) + (i1.i2.fused % n))*k) + (i1.i2.fused/n))]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould we change it to generate the Format1 indexing in order to optimize?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/319072364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/319080470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/283#issuecomment-319080470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/283","id":319080470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTA4MDQ3MA==","user":{"login":"ezyang","id":13564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang","html_url":"https://github.com/ezyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T14:18:07Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T14:18:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there a way to get access to the Jenkins?
