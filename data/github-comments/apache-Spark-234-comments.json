In fact, user don't have any idea about expected executors in mesos mode (and standalone mode), they only expect CPU cores(<code>spark.cores.max</code>). So we need check total registered executors' cores and <code>spark.cores.max</code> to judge whether SchedulerBackend is ready, and modify <code>spark.scheduler.minRegisteredExecutorsRatio</code> to <code>spark.scheduler.minRegisteredResourcesRatio</code>.\nHow do you think about
