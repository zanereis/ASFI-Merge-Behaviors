what would you like to discuss? I'd like to understand more about the use cases of Parquet in the wild to decide whether the proposed API in this PR is the right API - is there any Parquet expert you can add also as a reviewer? Eg I suppose people might want to choose to read only a subset of columns, or use filter pushdown. Write might need to be configurable in some way too.\r\n\r\nOther notes to modernize this PR:\r\n\r\n- The read transform seems to be non-parallel and reads a single file. Is this intentional?\r\n- I would recommend to start right away with a readFiles() version, like in TextIO, so that this can be freely combined with FileIO.match() and FileIO.read(). Is it possible to read chunks of a single Parquet file in parallel? If yes, then might want to use ReadAllFiles and have a BlockBasedSource, but might also just start with a ReadFn (but on top of ReadableFile).\r\n- Likewise I would recommend to implement the write side just as a sink on top of s.apache.org/fileio-write when it is ready (which should be soon enough so I think it makes sense to wait).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/327888785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/327888882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3815#issuecomment-327888882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3815","id":327888882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzg4ODg4Mg==","user":{"login":"mariapython","id":7925361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjUzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7925361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython","html_url":"https://github.com/mariapython","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mariapython/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-07T18:44:00Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T18:44:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:

So on the general case of tuple unpacking in lambdas: that's just gone in Python 3 and its not coming back.\r\n\r\nIn different places in the code the auto converter has taken different approaches to work around this.\r\nIf it's a function we can do multi-line you see things like \"xxx_todo_renameme\" (or you did before they were renamed but if you look at the commit from running futurize you can see it there) which is then followed by an explicit tuple unpack. In lambdas though that isn't really an option so we do the tuple indexing with compound names.\r\n\r\nSome of the lambdas which were too long after auto convert were transformed into def functions and use tuple indexing. I can re-factor these ones to do the explicit tuple unpacking and avoid the indexing if you think it looks nicer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/327992766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/327995256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3819#issuecomment-327995256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3819","id":327995256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzk5NTI1Ng==","user":{"login":"bastiliu","id":7921256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEyNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu","html_url":"https://github.com/bastiliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bastiliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T04:22:17Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T04:22:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@peihe
