If your momentum is small, the moving_mean and moving_var can change a little bit fast. For inference, the batch_mean and batch_var are no longer calculated. Instead, it uses moving_mean and moving_var as kind of global statistics.

To only train newly added layers such as a fully connected layer with a number of classes different from that of the original network, the first stage trains a cloned network with BlockGrad added after the internal layers. The internal layers parameters are still updated for the reason in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1340#issuecomment-174166248. The second stage trains the cloned network with all the BlockGrad symbols removed.\n\nInspired by the following codes.\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/d717c42025eeb0259e1e3e63d47a84f67a3740d3/tools/accnn/utils.py\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/cb8300739de673ed81540192f5129a58ff5ba456/tools/accnn/acc_conv.py\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1538#issuecomment-196691988\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/196795826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/196797593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1567#issuecomment-196797593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1567","id":196797593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Njc5NzU5Mw==","user":{"login":"taoari","id":3815006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTUwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3815006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari","html_url":"https://github.com/taoari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-15T12:26:48Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T12:28:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@futurely My experiments show that two-stage training is not a good idea.

think your codes are right if `Copy` do the actually memory copy, rather than just pass the pointer.\n\nthe reason might due to the updater's overhead is not small. in sync_dist, there is only one update for each layer in a minibatch, while for async, there are 12 updates. copying `recved` decouples the updating on the same key and therefore improve the performance. \n\nhowever, your method might only improve the performance if that layer size is small, e.g. convolution layer. while for big layers such as fully connected, the extra memory copy might be pretty big. \n\na possible solution is, copy only if the recved size is `< bigarray_bound_`, which is defined at https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/src/kvstore/kvstore_local.h#L28\n\ncould you please do the following two things\n1. confirm that `.Copy` will do the actual memory copy\n2. propose a PR to enable your trick if `recved.size <
