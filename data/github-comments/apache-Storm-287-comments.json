If STORM_ZOOKEEPER_TOPOLOGY_AUTH_SCHEME is set to cluster configuration, ZookeeperAuthInfo uses this. That means, even if ZookeeperAuthInfo class is used from Daemon side, topology-wise configuration will be used first. (I feel this behavior could be misleading.) So it shouldn't be set to \"digest\" with no auth.\r\n\r\nLong story in short, javadoc comment is effectively right even though it is really tricky. I'm not an expert of ZK auth and wondering why cluster wise configuration and topology wise configuration co-exist, given that it connects to same ZK.

Could you clarify a bit how the changes fix the issue you were seeing, and maybe also which Storm version you were seeing the issue on?\r\n\r\nThe default setting for nimbus.seeds is [\"localhost\"] (https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/conf/defaults.yaml#L61), which works fine for me when I try it locally, so I don't think there's a problem specifying a single host. We assume the configuration is a String list here https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/Config.java#L1052.\r\n\r\nThe change in L118 is checking if the config is a String[], which I would assume doesn't work since it is usually a `List<String>`? If you need to be able to write `nimbus.seeds: \"host\"` instead of `nimbus.seeds: [\"host\"]`, I think you should update the Config with this annotation https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/Config.java#L1120.\r\n\r\nPlease also create an issue on JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira and update your commit message and this PR's title to reflect the issue number (see the other PRs for example of what this should look like).

The code is really confusing and overly complicated.  I comes from when we were adding in security to storm.  It is a long story where we ran into several bugs/limitations in ZK itself that prevented us from doing what we initial wanted to do.  It also comes from the really confusing way that ZK handles authentication.\r\n\r\nZK supports both SASL authentication which is per connection, and a special digest authentication with can be per command and can override the connection authentication if any.  (don't confuse this special built in ZK digest authentication with the SASL digest authentication which ZK also supports, as they are different) SASL authentication with ZK is handled through the jaas conf.  There is a \"Client\" section that says how you want to authenticate with the zookeeper servers.  Using kerberos for this is the recommended way to authenticate ZK as it very secure.  STORM_ZOOKEEPER_AUTH_SCHEME allows you to use the built in ZK digest auth scheme in the daemons.  This is really only there for testing purposes.  Although it could work in production if you wanted it to, it just will be no where near as secure as kerberos is.\r\n\r\nOne of the issues we ran into with allowing the workers to communicate with ZK was that the workers needed some way to authenticate with ZK that didn't expire.  We could force everyone to send a TGT to the worker and then use that to authenticate with ZK, but TGTs expire and so users would have to push a new one periodically.  So we made the decision that we would use the built in ZK digest like a ticket.  We would randomly generate a 128 bit number as the secret, and then let nimbus setup the ACLs in ZK to only allow a user with that 128 bit secret to access the data.\r\n\r\nThat is how it currently works.  We didn't really like that and wanted to leave open the possibility of using a different auth scheme with ZK in the future.  That is why we have the configs as a string and not a boolean.  If we want to update the documentation for the cofnigs we can.  But I would say for now just mark them as being internal configs relating to security that the end user should not actually set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/316493611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/316500353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2204#issuecomment-316500353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2204","id":316500353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjUwMDM1Mw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T20:03:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T20:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Moreover I guess we would want to replace the old metrics (in storm internal) eventually.\r\n\r\nFor worker there's no more task-level metrics, only (worker, component)-level is available, and it only tracks emit, ack and fail. All metrics regarding latency are dropped. Netty metrics are dropped too. Some built-in metrics might not be able to be injected by users, so also need to consider about this when dropping metrics. Maybe would want to turn on and off recording part of metrics as Bobby suggested if they impact performance.\r\n\r\nAll of disruptor queue metrics are taken, but there are many disruptor queues in worker but metrics are worker-level, and it's gauge (not aggregation) so one of queue metrics would always overwrite.\r\n\r\nSo would like to see some explanations that which metrics are selected, how they're aggregated in worker, how decision has been made, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/316756346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/316790445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2228#issuecomment-316790445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2228","id":316790445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc5MDQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T18:28:30Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T18:28:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The patch right now looks fine to me, but I don't think it fixes your issue with flux.

@liu-zhaokun . I was just thinking that adding some instructions on [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/SECURITY.md#drpc-1) about DRPC is better than adding one more file in the _conf_ directory.  It would make me nervous to see some many configuration files if I'm just a user. People don't even need to care about DRPC configuration if they are not using it.
