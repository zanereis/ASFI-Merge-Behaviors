The OpenCypher team released a Neo4J-style driver that uses Gremlin behind the scenes. It appears to be API-compatible with the official Neo4J driver.\r\n\r\nWhat we'd probably want to do first is look at both drivers and see if the interfaces are 100% fungible. I believe they are, but that needs to be verified.\r\n\r\nIf they are, we should be able to write three controller services: one that implements a generic API for CRUD against Neo4J-style APIs and two that provide connection pooling against the backend to that service.\r\n\r\nThe processor would then defer most of its processing logic to the main controller service like a lot of processor families (ex. HBase and Mongo) do.\r\n\r\nGraph is a big open question, so for 1.9 we can punt on making the Neo4J capabilities set in stone so you/we can refactor while giving users a chance to play with it--with the understanding that it is an unstable feature set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/451783633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/451911945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3246#issuecomment-451911945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3246","id":451911945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTkxMTk0NQ==","user":{"login":"vkcelik","id":3533390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzMzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3533390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik","html_url":"https://github.com/vkcelik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkcelik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-07T11:54:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T11:54:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Requesting review.
