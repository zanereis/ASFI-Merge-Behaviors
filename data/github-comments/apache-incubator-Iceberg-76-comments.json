We can reassign all IDs from one file to the next and as long as they are internally consistent we are okay. The IDs are not embedded in separate files that might get improperly used.\r\n\r\nBut, the Nessie comment you pointed to is a good one to think about. I think it is still okay because Nessie merges would either be fast-forward, or would re-apply changes and create entirely new metadata files. So the internal consistency argument still holds.\r\n\r\n> Do we want to assign special schema IDs to metadata tables, to avoid potential collision on schema IDs?\r\n\r\nI don't think so.\r\n\r\n> Do we want to add snapshot-id to only history entries, or Snapshot interface?\r\n\r\nI would add it to Snapshot, not just History. Snapshot is what will be used for time travel queries. I would avoid adding too much metadata to history.\r\n\r\n> I think currently when replacing a table, earlier history entries/snapshotLog will be reset to empty (second to last argument in here). Is this expected? do we want to fix this as a separate issue?\r\n\r\nI think we should follow up and keep the history. I think the reason for this is because we previously didn't have any compatibility across schemas (IDs were completely reassigned, so time travel would be incorrect). But that's fixed now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/770291719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/770327766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2110#issuecomment-770327766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2110","id":770327766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDMyNzc2Ng==","user":{"login":"rdsr","id":129474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr","html_url":"https://github.com/rdsr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-31T05:10:36Z","updated_at":"2021-01-31T05:10:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Great to see this!

I am not sure I got it.\r\n\r\nBy my understanding the relevant change in #1875 is [this](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/commit/6731211eaf746c6a4abfe71386ef53172a3fc137#diff-e3082ef0c407c6d7644f453cd24a426eedc21fcdcb1fc501beeffb07b3070135L141-R138):\r\n```\r\n-      HiveCatalog hiveCatalog = HiveCatalogs.loadCatalog(conf);\r\n-      TableIdentifier tableIdentifier = TableIdentifier.parse(path.get());\r\n-      return hiveCatalog.loadTable(tableIdentifier);\r\n+      return CustomCatalogs.table(lazySparkSession(), path.get());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I right when assuming that this change replaces `HiveCatalogs.loadCatalog(conf)` with `CatalogUtil.buildIcebergCatalog(name, options, conf)`, which ultimately calls `CatalogUtil.loadCatalog(catalogImpl, name, options, conf)`?\r\n\r\nOne important difference between the 2 methods is that `HiveCatalogs.loadCatalog(conf)` comes with a `CATALOG_CACHE`, so if you call loadCatalog with the same thrift uri then we reuse the previously created HiveCatalog instance. This is good as this reuses the HiveClientPool instance in that catalog, and also could be problematic since if there is any difference in the configuration then it will not be applied to the new pool. OTOH `CatalogUtil` always creates a new HiveCatalog instance and with it a HiveClientPool instance.\r\n\r\nMy assumption was that the tests are creating multiple Catalog instances or they are not closing the Catalog instances correctly and this is the problem which causes the exhaustion of the Metastore thread pool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/770687222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/770747783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2163#issuecomment-770747783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2163","id":770747783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDc0Nzc4Mw==","user":{"login":"marton-bod","id":19599214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTk5MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19599214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod","html_url":"https://github.com/marton-bod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marton-bod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T10:23:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T10:23:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@pvary @lcspinter could you please review when you get the chance?

The fixes are available on the apache repos but they are not present on any of the releases ATM. Releasing both components would be a slow process because of the dependencies, and would greatly delay adding code here.

I ingested the data using the datastream Flink CDC api. I then used the FlinkSink in Iceberg to write to the Iceberg table. However, I can't seem to figure out this behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe application reads all the rows in the source db, but then doesn't write to the Iceberg table until I cancel the job (it's as if the data gets committed and shows up in S3 once I cancel the job). I checked if there was any backpressure in the job and there was none.\r\n\r\nFrom reading into the IcebergFilesCommitter, it seems that Iceberg writes the files on checkpoints ? (please correct me if I'm wrong, I didn't go through the entire implementation). I then enabled checkpoints at an interval of 30seconds and still same result. Will FlinkSink wait until it reaches the 128Mb default parquet files size in Iceberg before it writes out the file ?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771296624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771320010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2096#issuecomment-771320010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2096","id":771320010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTMyMDAxMA==","user":{"login":"yyanyy","id":71906210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTA2MjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71906210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy","html_url":"https://github.com/yyanyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyanyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T03:10:34Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T03:10:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Do we want to add a last-assigned-schema-id to table metadata?\r\n> \r\n> My initial thought was no because the schema IDs are completely local to a metadata file.

If no partition stats are updated for partition spec in new snapshot, we will point it to older partition stats file for that partition_stats_file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771579446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771605789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2180#issuecomment-771605789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2180","id":771605789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTYwNTc4OQ==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T12:36:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T12:36:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n> That said, I think we should fix `HiveCatalog` constructor that just accepts a Hadoop conf. \r\n\r\nagreed, will take a look at that\r\n\r\n> Also, I would remove the constructor from `HiveClientPool` that does not accept the pool size (it is package private and only used in one place I am suggesting to update). \r\n\r\nalso agreed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771605789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771611181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2180#issuecomment-771611181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2180","id":771611181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTYxMTE4MQ==","user":{"login":"rymurr","id":2022305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2022305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr","html_url":"https://github.com/rymurr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rymurr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T12:46:59Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T12:46:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe this question is for a new issue but: What do people think about the `HiveCatalog` lifecycle in general?

I've looked into a more formal resource ownership model but it breaks a lot of unit tests as the lifetime of `HiveCatalog` isn't consistent across tests.

There is one exception, when `iceberg.catalog=location_based_table`.

This method expects the mandatory catalog specific properties. In order to assemble this collection, I would need to know what properties are required, but since we are talking about a custom catalog, basically this can be anything. In the end, I decided the remove the support of custom catalog configuration through the `iceberg.mr.catalog.loader.class` property.\r\nOf course, it is still possible to configure custom catalogs, but only through the `iceberg.catalog` table property. This way I know that all the catalog specific parameters are prefixed, and I can pass them to the CatalogUtil.buildIcebergCatalog().\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771698156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771712074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2195#issuecomment-771712074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2195","id":771712074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTcxMjA3NA==","user":{"login":"Stephen-Robin","id":77377842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mzc3ODQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77377842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin","html_url":"https://github.com/Stephen-Robin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen-Robin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T15:23:46Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T15:24:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> That does seem pretty dangerous although I haven't seen this happen before.

For example, a file size is 8M, and the default value of the open file cost is 4M. After bin pack, the 8M files are in a package. The line code is to filter out. In this case, redundant writing is avoided, but files that exceed the split target size will have problems in the issue.\r\nI have tried to fix the problem and can view it¬†https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2196/commits.\r\nIf you need some data during my test, I will provide it at any time\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771712074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771713658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2195#issuecomment-771713658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2195","id":771713658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTcxMzY1OA==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T15:26:04Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T15:26:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not sure how the above line would cause data loss, it looks like it just there to determine which files to be re-written.

But the whole 'large file' will be deleted because it is in the currentDataFiles.\r\n\r\nUsing the example mentioned in the issue, file part A (10M) is not in currentFile,  file part B (1M) is in currentFile, but file A (10M) is not in addedFile.But after commit, the manifest status corresponding to the initial 11M file will be set to deleted\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771725145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/771779923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2047#issuecomment-771779923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2047","id":771779923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTc3OTkyMw==","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T16:49:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T22:46:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx yes, please help review this unit test refactoring next.

What is the underlying use case you're trying to solve with number of files and number of rows?\r\n\r\nWould it also make sense to add partition-level stats like column lower/upper bounds, value counts, null counts, and NaN counts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/772044013/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/772052442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2182#issuecomment-772052442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2182","id":772052442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjA1MjQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T22:27:40Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T22:27:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also think that we need to have a concrete plan for how these files are created and updated.\r\n\r\nThe number of partitions in a table could easily be a few million.
