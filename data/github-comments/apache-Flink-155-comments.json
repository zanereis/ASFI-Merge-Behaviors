The pull request changes many things together. Some can work, and for others I would suggest to do it differently.\r\nLet me know what you think about this:\r\n\r\n## Changing the `StateDescriptor`\r\n\r\nThis is probably a good cleanup. It does currently break the backwards compatibility, because Flink 1.1 wrote the state descriptors into the checkpoints. Flink 1.2 and 1.3 do not do that any more, but currently rely on the unchanged StateDescriptor classes for resuming Flink-1.1-savepoints.\r\n\r\nWe added a way to define \"migration\" classes, meaning we can store the old StateDescriptor classes in a migration package where they are dynamically loaded only as proxies when resuming a Flink-1.1 savepoint. That way we can change the classes and maintain backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Removing `clear()` from`State`\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to keep `clear()` on the base `State` interface. Can you explain why you want to remove it? In my opinion, every state needs to be able to clear, so it makes sense to have this on the case interface.\r\n\r\nIf this is in preparation for the `MapState`, then the `MapState` can simply override the `clear()` method with different logic. \r\n  - I think that the MapState needs to support clear as well, where it deletes the sub-map for the current key.\r\n  - On the HeapStateBackend, this is quite easy, when we assume that each (key/namespace) has a map as the value (and the complete map can be dropped)\r\n  - For the RocksDBStateBackend, it is a bit more expensive, and would correspond to a range-iteration-and-deletes.\r\n\r\nIf an application decides that the MapState clear() is to expensive, it can decide to not call it.

So, I added these CSS classes to it \".hidden-xs .hidden-sm .hidden-md\" the behavior of which is described on http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities I am not sure what width @uce used for the \"wide\" screenshots, but it probably was less than 1200px, otherwise it would show up. I can remove the \".hidden-md\" class if you want it to show up in the 992px to 1200px range, too... however it does make it more likely for the other more job-specific elements (start/end, duration) to wrap & get lost. Perhaps it would be a good idea to reorder the elements? Put start/end & duration first, and overall job stats last so that it's the first one to wrap?

re-clarification about backwards compatibility for state type change:\r\nCurrently, one limitation for compatible applications across savepoint restore is that you can't change the type of state otherwise state restore will fail, therefore not compatible. The only work around, is to have another field as the new state with the new type, and somehow try to \"encode\" / \"decode\" the watermark state into / from the original `Tuple2<KafkaTopicPartition, Long>`. I don't think this is easily possible ...\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there was recent discussion about letting the window operators also checkpoint watermarks. So perhaps we might not need to let the Kafka sources checkpoint watermarks in the end, if the window operators already take care of restoring the previous event time.\r\nWhat I'm curious about right now is whether or not in the future, redistributions of Kafka partition states across source subtasks will work well with the checkpointed watermarks in the downstream window operators. I don't think there should be a problem, i.e. late elements should still be dropped by the window operators in that case.\r\n\r\n@aljoscha can you perhaps help clarify this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275333683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275335026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2361#issuecomment-275335026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2361","id":275335026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTMzNTAyNg==","user":{"login":"mushketyk","id":592286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjI4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/592286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk","html_url":"https://github.com/mushketyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mushketyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-26T08:43:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T08:43:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @kl0u,\r\n\r\nYes you are right.

Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\nThe problem is in the `NFACompiler` and more specifically the way the pattern is compiled. I have not come up with a concrete solution yet but I would say that:\r\n\r\ni) there should be another `StateType` as well, sth like `PotentialFinal` (or a better name) and in the case that the final pattern is optional, then it gets assigned this `StateType`. This also propagates backwards in the pattern graph in the case that the final pattern is optional (0 to sth times). \r\n\r\nii) the `addTransitions()` should also be extended to account for quantifiers  at the end and at the start of the pattern when \"unrolling\" or expanding the original pattern, e.g. the `expandRepeatingPattern()` should not always assign `State.StateType.Normal` to the unrolled patterns as they may be at the end or the start.\r\n\r\niii) the `NFA` should also be modified to account for the new `PotentialFinal` state. In this case, when we see such a pattern, a flag should be set, and for example in the one-to-many case the pattern should be matched when the next non-matching element comes.\r\n\r\nAgain these are some initial thoughts. We can discuss more on the design if you want, as this seems to be a bigger change than expected ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275349182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/275349757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3127#issuecomment-275349757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3127","id":275349757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTM0OTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-26T09:58:43Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T09:58:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would also be fine with `StreamExecutionEnvironment.fromCollection(rows, type)`.

So if the pattern says sth like `'a'.oneOrMany`, the `a` will be `PotentiallyFinal` with a self-loop. So when the `NFA` receives the first `a`, it will have to set a flag, e.g. `canTerminate` to `true`. Then another `a`, still valid, so the `NFA` will accept it, and then a `b`.

And `${project.build.directory}/tmp` will be clean up when executing `mvn clean`.  IMO, `${project.build.directory}` target dir can avoid multiple users building projects to share the same directory `/tmp` problem thoroughly. \r\n\r\nIn another word, I think project building's boundary is its target directory. Beyond target dir  should be not reasonable.
