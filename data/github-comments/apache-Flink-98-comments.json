just wanted to echo @StephanEwen 's sentiment.  \n\nFlink's management of offsets seems to supersede the Kafka concept of committed offsets (whether to ZK or an 0.9 broker) leaving me to think there are only 2 scenarios where offset commitment is useful in the context of flink :\n- coordinating delivery with consumers outside the flink ecosystem (which seems conceptually dubious)\n- reporting to monitoring software that understands 0.8- zookeeper stored offsets or 0.9+ broker stored offsets\n\nI would consider both of these to be optional features and not required features. \n\nFor my particular use case, we are on Kafka 0.8 and requiring write access to the zookeeper cluster that is coordinating kafka in order to access read-only message data is problematic.

Running the `Graph500` example on an AWS c4.8xlarge (with 36 'virtual cores') generated a billion edges (scale 26, edge factor 16) in 25.8s wall time (23.4s execution time). When simplifying the graph with 'clip-and-flip' the runtime was 2m33s wall time (2m31s execution time) and when performing a full flip (thus doubling the number of edges) the runtime was 5m00s wall time (4m58s execution time).\n\nMany algorithms require edges to be sorted so that cost is already accounted for. Edge generation should scale beautifully.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/207546079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/207547199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1220#issuecomment-207547199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1220","id":207547199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzU0NzE5OQ==","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T18:26:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T18:26:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danielblazevski : Sorry, but could you help rebase the conflicts for this PR?
