for the SDK core part, this is a great improvement.\r\nOne thing to consider for the future is that we are trying to encapsulate (shade is a part of this) most IOs to avoid leaking deps that produce dependency conflicts like guava or protobuf, but the GCP IOs seem to be the hardest to isolate since the main API of some of the IOs exposes guava or protobuf, it would be nice to consider to do this too for those IOs in the future, users running their own cluster can get into these problems when trying to integrate with the GCP IOs if we don't isolate this correctly, so maybe worth considering.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/294338446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/294340469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2548#issuecomment-294340469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2548","id":294340469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDM0MDQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-16T08:35:41Z","updated_at":"2017-04-16T08:35:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
