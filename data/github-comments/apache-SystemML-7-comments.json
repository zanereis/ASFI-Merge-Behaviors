The corresponding test scripts were adapted from functions.misc.FunctionInliningTest except functions foo1 and foo2 were refactored into separate script files.  Manually checked under Eclipse debugger that StatementBlock.rIsInlineableFunction returned false (at reject control flow blocks).\n\n2) Added verification of no parser error output to console (similar to what was done in functions.misc.SetWorkingDirTest of [SYSTEMML-611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-611).  This ensures test fails when parse issues displayed to console.\n\nAlso investigated circular references between separate scripts and reproduced stack overflow issue [SYSTEMML-625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-625).

After setting up a recent Flink 1.0.1, I gave it a try on LinearRegDS.dml and a 80GB scenario (10M x 1k, dense w/ binary inputs) in hybrid_flink execution mode. Unfortunately, it was failing during lops construction due to the missing integration of matrix multiply operator selection (in AggBinaryOp). I would recommend to focus on the common distributed operations first: in hybrid execution mode and with moderately large data, we would only run tsmm and mapmm (both compiled from AggBinaryOp) as Flink operations, while all other operations are compiled as pure in-memory CP operations. You have already added all required instructions - that's great, so it would just take some additional wiring in AggBinaryOp and the related lops. \n\nFurthermore, here are also some additional comments on the actual implementation:\n\n1) APIs and interfaces: Unfortunately, you've put already effort into API extensions. I would recommend to remove the modifications of MLOutput and MLContext because MLOutput is not maintained and MLContext is about to get a major refactoring. Let's use the command line interface for now and extend the APIs once the backend is ready.\n\n2) Isolation of Flink dependencies: We need to be very careful about introducing Flink API dependencies into shared classes in order to ensure that Spark and Flink backends can be used without dependency on the other. For example, there are (1) references to Flink in runtime/controlprogram/Program, and (2) references to the SparkExecutionContext in Flink execution modes. Could you please systematically go over shared classes and double check for isolation?\n\n3) Bufferpool integration: I agree that the duplication of RDDObject and DataSetObject creates unnecessary redundancy in a core place like our bufferpool (CacheableData and ExecutionContext). Let's abstract this to something like DistDataObject with two implementations RDDObject and DataSetObject. Just let me know, I'd be happy to prepare this for you guys.\n\n4) Broadcast memory budget: Currently, the broadcast memory budget is obtained from the SparkExecutionContext. It would be good to automatically obtain this size (e.g., size for user objects) to remove the dependency and because it is really important for operator selection.\n\n5) Checkpointing: I see a CheckpointFLInstruction which always does a pass-through. Let's remove this instruction (until Flink supports distributed caching) and simply do not apply the rewrites for injecting these checkpoints (RewriteInjectSparkLoopCheckpointing, RewriteInjectSparkPReadCheckpointing).  \n\n6) Instructions w/ broadcasts: There seem to be some inconsistencies wrt when and how we broadcast data (e.g., join vs join w/ hint vs withBroadcastSet). I understand that Flink offers optimization capabilities in that regard. However, from a SystemML perspective I would recommend to stick to physical operator semantics (e.g., MAPMM with broadcast, CPMM/RMM with join). If experiments show that Flink actually does better than our operator selection, we could simply compile earlier (for smaller data sizes) CPMM/RMM. Btw, is there a way to pin the broadcast in distributed memory and reuse it across multiple invocations? \n\n7) Advanced operations: You already added compiler support for advanced operations like weighted squared loss and cumulative aggregates. Let's put these aside for now and get a narrow prototype running well first before we broaden the scope.\n\n8) Tests: It would be good if we could add a few tests for flink mapmm and tsmm to ensure they are producing correct results as this is the precondition for any experiments. Please have a look into FullMatrixMultiplicationTransposeSelfTest and FullDistributedMatrixMultiplicationTest.\n\n9) Exception handling: There are a couple of instances where exceptions are simply put to stderr. Could you please double check that all caught exceptions are rethrown in order to simplify debugging. Also, please replace the assertions for dimensions mismatch checks with exceptions as these checks need to happen even if assertions are disabled (by default).\n\n10) Formatting: Well, we don't have a style guide defined yet but the project-wide convention is to use tabs instead of spaces (e.g., issues in DMLScript). Furthermore, you've also done some code cleanups of formatting existing code. Could we separate these changes out of this PR to simplify the review? Feel free to submit them as an individual PR though.  \n\nFinally, as a next step after this PR I would recommend to extend the scenario to LinearRegCG.dml as an iterative algorithm with similar core operations. I would find an investigation of Flink's iteration features very interesting. One direction could be to automatically compile this iteration construct for while loops via rewrites.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/211207187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/211211586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/120#issuecomment-211211586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/120","id":211211586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTIxMTU4Ng==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-18T05:37:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T05:38:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"4) Please also consider to implement it as matrix to string cast (with special handling of 1x1 matrices) which would resolve the previously discussed issue of print(\"result = \"+X[1,1]) as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/211211586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/211213844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/118#issuecomment-211213844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/118","id":211213844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTIxMzg0NA==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-18T05:46:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T05:46:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM -

It's actually probably hard to do without introducing something like a printMatrix function. For instance, I could see situations where those bounding boxes are nice (view in console), and I could also see where simple comma-separated values would be nice (copy/paste into Excel). There can be situations where conciseness is nice (and have only a single number to the right of the decimal), and other situations where precision is nice (show lots of numbers to the right of the decimal). Also, it might even be nice to have a dense/sparse option (as Wenpei mentioned), where sparse displays something like i,j,v format rather than a dense 'spreadsheet' look.\n\nHowever, it's great to be able to display any kind of matrix representation via print(), since currently this has not been possible.

I like Matthias's idea of implicitly introducing indexing op, which performs following logic (but at hop level):\n\n``` python\nrlen = nrow(X)\nif(nrow(X) > rowThreshold) {\n   rlen = rowThreshold\n}\nclen = ncol(X)\nif(ncol(X) > colThreshold) {\n   clen = colThreshold\n}\nprint(toString(X[1:rlen, 1:clen], ...))\n```\n\nThe next question is why not do implicit conversion instead of toString() method. I like implicit conversion iff we can handle following DML code:\n\n``` python\ny = \" \" + X\nX1 = y * X\n```\n\nAlso, I would like to point out that at language level we have a string representation of matrix, i.e. `matrix(\"1 2 3 4\", rows=2 ,cols=2)`. By having a pretty printing builtin function like toString(), we don't have to worry about incorrect implicit conversions. \n\nThough I don't have a strong opinion about format type, I would suggest sticking to format that we expose in read/write methods (i.e. \"csv\" for dense and \"text\" for sparse) rather than call then as dense or sparse OR we can add the new pretty printed matrix format into read/write as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/212022956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/212202419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/116#issuecomment-212202419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/116","id":212202419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjIwMjQxOQ==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T01:33:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T01:33:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/212202419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/212203361","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/117#issuecomment-212203361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/117","id":212203361,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjIwMzM2MQ==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T01:34:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T01:34:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's deal with the code formatting later.

on the discussion here, offline discussion with @niketanpansare and some thought, IMHO, here are a two of ways of printing matrices:\n\n### 1. Introduce DML functions - `as.string, castAsString`\n\n```\nX = rand(rows=1000, cols=1000, min=0, max=4, pdf=\"uniform\", sparsity=0.2)\nZ = as.string(X[1:10,1:10])\nprint(Z)\n```\n\nThe `as.string` can have additional arguments that @Wenpei suggested (i.e. maxRows, maxCols, dense & decimel with default values for each)\n\n```\nY = as.string(X, maxRows=10, maxCols=20, decimel=4)\nprint(\"The matrix is \" + Y)\n```\n\nThis method has the problem of explicitly converting matrices to strings before passing them to the print statement.\nSince the entire system assumes that any binary operation with a matrix yields a matrix, checks for that would not have to be modified throughout the system.\nAlso `as.string` would extend to frames and other data structures as they come along.\n\n### 2. Support it directly from the print statement (as is done in this PR)\n\nThis code would work directly because the builtin print function would know how to handle matrices.\n\n```\nX = rand(rows=1000, cols=1000, min=0, max=4, pdf=\"uniform\", sparsity=0.2)\nZ = X[1:10,1:10]\nprint(Z)\n```\n\nAdditional arguments can be passed to the print statement like so\n\n```\nprint (Z, maxRows=10, maxCols=5, dense=true)\n```\n\nThis method would have the problem of changing the underlying systems assumption that any binary operation with a matrix yields a matrix. \nThe advantage is that it would \"feel\" more natural.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/213157381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/213160249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/120#issuecomment-213160249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/120","id":213160249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzE2MDI0OQ==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T23:37:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T23:37:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"from my side a +1 for option one - this allows much more flexibility. \n\nHowever, in terms of language-level integration, we need to think about better alternatives because as.logical / as.integer / as.double and the proposed as.string are pure value-type casts whereas the proposed functionality covers both value-type and data-type cast, i.e., double - matrix into string - scalar.

please keep this as simple as possible at the language level, and not _force_ usage in DML of anything like `as.string(...)` with a multitude of parameters just for simply printing a matrix (which

It's already annoying enough for users to have to convert a 1x1 matrix `X` to a scalar with `as.scalar(X)` every time we want to print it or assign it to a scalar variable (i.e. when performing a full right index `X[1,5]`).

The wording `per-task basis` is changed to `per SystemML-task basis`. As for how the configs were propagated, it looks from the server side logs that they were just passed to all MR jobs generated by SystemML.

I just partially addressed your comments in the commit 49b0858, but still left the task to create consistency between the names of arguments. I want to hear your opinion for the left task. My opinion is that `maxiter` in m-svm.dml (or l2-svm.dml) is inconsistent, because other scripts(e.g. LinearRegDS, Kmeans.dml) use `maxi` as name of the same meaning argument. I think `maxiter` (or `maxi`) should be `maxi` (or `maxiter`), but `moi` should be not changed because `moi` includes meaning outer-iterations. Is it correct as understanding following comment.\n\n> That reminds me, it would be also useful to create consistency between the names of these arguments  across all dml scripts. \n\nThank you. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/214222249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/214488223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/125#issuecomment-214488223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/125","id":214488223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDQ4ODIyMw==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T19:19:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T19:19:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/214488223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/214505335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/114#issuecomment-214505335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/114","id":214505335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDUwNTMzNQ==","user":{"login":"bertholdreinwald","id":10200727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAwNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10200727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald","html_url":"https://github.com/bertholdreinwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T20:13:05Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T20:13:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @nishi-t .

Could you please find another builtin name that conveys the meaning better. How about R's cat or toString (please have a look at the docs)? We should only introduce custom functions if there is a real good argument for it. Also, in relation to existing functions like read, write and transformmeta it would be good to use 'sep' instead of 'separator'.\n\n2) ExecType selection: Please fix the execution type selection (independent of memory, see transformmeta). Right now the compilation would crash for large matrices or in forced exec type hadoop/spark. \n\n3) String conversion: Please move the print out of core data structures like MatrixBlock, SparseBlock and all its implementations. This functionality is not performance critical\nand should be implemented against basic sparse iterators or get.
