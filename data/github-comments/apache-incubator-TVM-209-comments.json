@Laurawly \r\nI am quite confused about the test data used in `test_non_max_suppression` from `tests/python/relay/test_op_level5.py`.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, a `get_valid_count`, a `non_max_suppression` and a `strided_slice` are used together as a `non_max_suppression` operator according to `def _nms()` from `frontend/tensorflow.py`. The `get_valid_counts` of the `cuda` version does not move valid boxes to the top of input data, while the `get_valid_counts` of the `cpu` version does the job.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it seems to make more sense if we use different test data for the `test_non_max_suppression`\r\nFor example\r\n``` python\r\nthe original data before get_valid_counts\r\n\r\nnp_data = np.array([[[0, 0.8, 1, 20, 25, 45], \r\n                     [1, 0.7, 30, 60, 50, 80],\r\n                     [0, 0.4, 4, 21, 19, 40], \r\n                     [2, 0.9, 35, 61, 52, 79],\r\n                     [1, 0.5, 100, 60, 70, 110]]]).astype(\"float32\")\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncpu test data after get_valid_counts\r\n\r\nnp_data = np.array([[[0, 0.8, 1, 20, 25, 45], \r\n                     [1, 0.7, 1, 20, 25, 45],\r\n                     [2, 0.9, 35, 61, 52, 79],\r\n                     [1, 0.5, 100, 60, 70, 110], \r\n                     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]]).astype(\"float32\")\r\n\r\nnp_indices = np.array([[0, 1, 3, 4, -1]]).astype(\"int32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncuda test data after get_valid_counts\r\n\r\nnp_data = np.array([[[0, 0.8, 1, 20, 25, 45], \r\n                     [1, 0.7, 2, 21, 26, 45],\r\n                     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1], \r\n                     [2, 0.9, 35, 61, 52, 79],\r\n                     [1, 0.5, 100, 60, 70, 110]]]).astype(\"float32\")\r\n\r\nnp_indices = np.array([[0, 1, -1, 3, 4]]).astype(\"int32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/683385549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/683544704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6238#issuecomment-683544704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6238","id":683544704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzU0NDcwNA==","user":{"login":"ANSHUMAN87","id":32511895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTExODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32511895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87","html_url":"https://github.com/ANSHUMAN87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ANSHUMAN87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-31T04:39:31Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T04:39:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Gentle ping @MarisaKirisame !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/683544704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/683642300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6238#issuecomment-683642300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6238","id":683642300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzY0MjMwMA==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-31T08:27:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T08:27:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ANSHUMAN87 sorry!
