I think that it's actually _easier_ to audit the fortanix implementation since it's all in Rust and not spread across two completely separate codebases. Indeed, the usercalls are exactly equivalent to ocalls but are more observable (moreso since a user can't create their own usercalls as they could ocalls).\r\n\r\n> depending on untrusted Mutex\r\n\r\nRight, but all the untrusted OS can do is not provide threads. That only compromises availability, and the untrusted system is always able to harm availability simply by not running the enclave. Correctness is not affected.\r\n\r\n>  LibOS-like Rust-SGX environment without any ability to control/audit the usercalls \r\n\r\nThis is a fair point. Allowing a supposedly secure enclave to trivially access untrusted functions like `fs`, `net`, and `time` is not a good model for users who don't understand the security implications of doing so. The approach of r-s-s which makes these modules private is certainly the more explicit approach. For experienced users and library authors, however, usercalls offer greater usability.\r\n\r\n>  pwasm-std\r\n\r\nFWIW, without wasi, `fs` doesn't compile under `wasm32-unknown-*`. (sys|user)calls aside, pwasm-std unnecessarily limits itself by not including the standard library. Their focus is not security, but rather ensuring that consensus succeeds. Disallowing structures like `HashMap` is an oversight since serialization is, in fact, canonical. Similarly with their disallowing floats: it's totally possible to do flops if one \"simply\" canonicalizes the Wasm NaN representation. Of course, pwasm is unrelated to the matter at hand :)\r\n\r\nAs another point in favor of the fortanix edp, there's substantially lower overhead from ecalls/ocalls since it transparently implements switchless.\r\n\r\nOverall, if the TVM runtime using more than just `std::thread` and those threads _weren't_ embarrassingly parallel, I'd be more concerned about security. The main boons of switching are maintainability and usability.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480180856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480183779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2932#issuecomment-480183779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2932","id":480183779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDE4Mzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T07:57:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T07:57:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The problem with unscheduled scalars on GPU is, the host code initialize the scalar tensor directly, instead of finding the tensor in `params` dict as for non-scalar constant cases.

The main question is the naming convention to make sure we are not confusing the users.

However, our past experiences suggest that the automatic wrapper generation is never perfect. Think about how can we support keyword arguments, good pythonic style docstring and so on. It is also harder for developers to find the actual implementation of the \"generated API\" since some of them are generated at runtime. Eventually, we find that it is simpler to just do a manual wrapping, which gives us all the good native features, docs, and keep PackedFunc simple (by only support positional arguments without any meta-data).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480633428/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480636335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2981#issuecomment-480636335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2981","id":480636335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDYzNjMzNQ==","user":{"login":"nhynes","id":2353785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes","html_url":"https://github.com/nhynes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-07T22:43:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-07T22:43:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This idea actually comes a lot :P https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2328#issuecomment-450001679\r\n\r\nI know, for sure, that we could get good docs with _really good_ codegen like that offered by Rust macros, but I also know for sure that we're not about to rewrite TVM in Rust :)\r\n\r\nI think that the boilerplate really does bother new (advanced) users who want to use TVM as a tool.

The main challenge is to keep most of the data structures purely in C(so we can get ABI compatibility across languages).  We do also want to keep some of the node base class and the possibility to declare node inside c++ for some private temp node. Which does not enjoy the cross-lang features but can make easy use of any language-specific data structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480687154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480688085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2982#issuecomment-480688085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2982","id":480688085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDY4ODA4NQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T05:25:06Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T05:25:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is merged.
