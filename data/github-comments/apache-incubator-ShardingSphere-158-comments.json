for our next discussion.\r\n> * [x]  Coding work to modify the configuration handling of `YAML`, `Java-based` for `ShardingJDBC` and `ShardingProxy`\r\n> * [ ]  Coding work to modify the configuration handling of `SpringNameSpace`, `SpringBoot` for `ShardingJDBC`\r\n> * [ ]  The similar changes for `ShardingSphere example module`\r\n> * [ ]   The API doc\r\n> \r\n> This is just a crude plan for this issue. However, you are the exact person responsible for it on-site, so follow your pace!\r\n> One concern for me is that you had better make one PR **not so large**.\r\n> If you need any help, please be free to ping me. :-)\r\n\r\nThanks for your trust.

Welcome your review.\r\n\r\n- `dataSourceTemplates`\r\nThis configuration seems clear, so I suppose we can first start with it. As you know, ShardingSphere is an extensive map needing more effort for you to explore so that we could start this journey by this work first. Otherwise, you have to face a considerable challenge. **One tip I need to emphasize** that I wish this item is optional, i.e., if there are no many data sources, users could configure the whole props for data sources one by one.\r\n\r\n- `tables`-1\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nrules:\r\n- !SHARDING\r\n  shardingTables:\r\n    - #Sample1: all tables Sharding by item_id should be under this group\r\n      tables: t_order, t_order_item\r\n```\r\nI prefer to group tables having the same configuration! However, our 5.x release is coming soon, and it looks your changes will have a significant impact on the API. I am concerned that it will confuse users a lot. Hence, do you think we could have slightly smaller changes for them? But please take it easy. We could first consider the change for `dataSources` and put off this one later.\r\n\r\n- `table`-1\r\n```yaml\r\nrules:\r\n- !SHARDING\r\n  tables:\r\n    template_item_id:\r\n    t_order:\r\n```\r\nIMO, this example will confuse users, since `template_item_id ` differ from `t_order`, doesn't it?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/699755861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/699761077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637#issuecomment-699761077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7637","id":699761077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5OTc2MTA3Nw==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-28T04:21:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T04:21:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7637](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/commit/9d7ade09b68d8c043df44f438ffd2e17c472ce39?el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=ZvlXpWa7so)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##             master    #7637   +/-   ##\n=========================================\n  Coverage     75.52%   75.52%           \n  Complexity      509      509           \n=========================================\n  Files          1397     1397           \n  Lines         22222    22222           \n  Branches       3960     3960           \n=========================================\n  Hits          16784    16784           \n  Misses         4369     4369           \n  Partials       1069     1069           \n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7637?src=pr&el=footer).
