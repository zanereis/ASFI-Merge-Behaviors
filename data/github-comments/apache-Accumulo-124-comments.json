A couple of nice things about this (with or without the per-table subdirectory), is that you could lower the replication on the tmp files or change the erasure-coding configuration on the tmp directory. The downside with that though is I think you would have to copy the files to their destination instead of moving them. If the directory was configurable, you could store the temp files on a totally different volume, which would also require a copy.\r\n\r\nEdit: An interesting side-effect of the configurable tmp directory and copy to final destination, is that you could set the tmp directory to `file:///` and write the temporary compaction output to a local directory which would be faster and lower the usage of the backing distributed filesystem (HDFS, S3, etc.). The copy would be done as part of bringing the major compaction online. In this case, writing local to the Compactor, this changes how tmp files are cleaned up, as they would be cleaned up by the Compactor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1815365636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1815449744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3953#issuecomment-1815449744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3953","id":1815449744,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5sNZCQ","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-16T23:01:35Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T23:01:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is already super trivial to do the modifyProperties command with jshell, I'm not sure it makes sense to add complexity to the shell to offer a second way of doing it.

Is that what you mean?\r\n\r\nMetrics, logging, some pluggable interface to collect state, it doesn't really matter to me. I was mostly describing the general idea of shifting away from focusing on providing a specific end-to-end solution to providing the bits for users to create their own end-to-end solution. So, instead of us tracking the last write/compaction, or the last assignment, in our metadata and providing specific config knobs for that behavior, and then wiring that up for users as an option to a pre-provisioned balancer, we should maybe focus our implementations on providing insights (metrics is one way) to users, and pluggable interfaces for users to make their own choices about how to use those insights. This is just a better overall strategy, because it gives users more flexibility to support a variety of use cases we haven't thought of in advance, rather than constraining user imagination by locking them in on our specific thoughts. It also has the potential to dramatically reduce baked-in complexity and code size that we need to maintain.\r\n\r\nHow this idea comes into play here: don't bother changing the property options and behavior... just deprecate it and create an emitter (metrics, or whatever) that users can collect information from, that records things like details on assignment activity or details on compaction activity. Then, leave it to users to wire that information in to their own custom balancer, or wherever else they want to use it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1816611392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1816658764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3926#issuecomment-1816658764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3926","id":1816658764,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5sSANM","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-17T15:43:27Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T15:43:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So, I understand your approach here, but I think I'll need you to elaborate on your idea from an implementation perspective.

Or a plugin could have no configuration options for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1816658764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1816787095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3856#issuecomment-1816787095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3856","id":1816787095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5sSfiX","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-17T17:06:45Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T17:06:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @keith-turner @ctubbsii - I think this issue pre-dates the change regarding online/offline vs enabled/disabled for table states. So my question, should a user be able to alter a table that is disabled? If not, then we can close this (and probably open an issue to enforce this).\r\n> \r\n> Edit: [This](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3851#issuecomment-1766507126) comment implies that it might be useful to change the state when disabled.\r\n\r\nFor a disabled table, I think the critical part is that the structure of the table can't be changed... you can't add or delete data, or merge tablets, or add split points, or change its files, etc. Also, we won't make it available for reads or other operations that require resources to be actively put to use, like creating a scanner. You should still be able to do non-destructive backup-type operations, like export table and clone. For metadata/config operations, I'm not so sure. I think there's value, for surgical/administrative/repair purposes, in being able to alter configuration and doing certain surgical operations to tablet state in the metadata, but I'm not sure if we want to open that floodgate to any of those types of operations, because if we do, then we might want to start allowing metadata-only operations like adding splits and merges, and there's good reasons to not allow that.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could restrict these metadata/config alterations to only surgical use with an admin/surgery tool, but they are disallowed via the public API? I'm not sure. You can already do these kinds of surgical operations manually by editing the metadata table and ZK directly... so, I think this is really a question of what the permission checks are for doing it through the public API or if we provide any particular tooling for it (which is really two separate questions).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1816787095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1816857435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3956#issuecomment-1816857435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3956","id":1816857435,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5sSwtb","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-17T17:56:54Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T17:56:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you show what it looks like when processed / rendered?

Is that what you mean?\r\n> \r\n> Metrics, logging, some pluggable interface to collect state, it doesn't really matter to me. I was mostly describing the general idea of shifting away from focusing on providing a specific end-to-end solution to providing the bits for users to create their own end-to-end solution. So, instead of us tracking the last write/compaction, or the last assignment, in our metadata and providing specific config knobs for that behavior, and then wiring that up for users as an option to a pre-provisioned balancer, we should maybe focus our implementations on providing insights (metrics is one way) to users, and pluggable interfaces for users to make their own choices about how to use those insights. This is just a better overall strategy, because it gives users more flexibility to support a variety of use cases we haven't thought of in advance, rather than constraining user imagination by locking them in on our specific thoughts. It also has the potential to dramatically reduce baked-in complexity and code size that we need to maintain.\r\n> \r\n> How this idea comes into play here: don't bother changing the property options and behavior... just deprecate it and create an emitter (metrics, or whatever) that users can collect information from, that records things like details on assignment activity or details on compaction activity. Then, leave it to users to wire that information in to their own custom balancer, or wherever else they want to use it.\r\n\r\nThe last known location is provided to the balancer SPI in [AssignmentParameters.unassignedTablets](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/spi/balancer/TabletBalancer.java#L61).

We have been moving code that is specific to TGW from the manager class into TGW as we have changed functionality.  Would like to continue this migration of code out of the manager into the  functional components it runs.  Hoping eventually the manager can have little code other than creating functional components like TGW, compaction coordinator, fate, etc and wiring them together.  Hoping the partition data concept can help with this as how different component parition their work/data will be different.

With the algorithm in this method different manager processes may see different counts for the same tables at different times and end up partitioning tables into different buckets. This could lead to overlap in the partitions or in the worst case a table that no manager processes. We could start with a deterministic hash partitioning of tables and open a follow in issue to improve. One possible way to improve would be to have a single manager process run this algorithm and publish the partitioning information, with all other manager just using it.\r\n\r\n> This would be a follow on issue, thinking we could distribute the compaction coordinator by having it hash parition queue names. among manager processes. TGW could make an RPC to add a job to a remote queue. Compaction coordinators could hash the name to find the manager process to ask for work.\r\n\r\n> We may need to make the EventCoordinator use the same partitioning as the TGW and send events to other manager processes via a new async RPC. Need to analyze the EventCoordinator, may make sense to pull it in to the TGW conceptually. Every manager uses it local TGW instance to signal events and internally the TGW code knows how to route that in the cluster to other TGW instances.\r\n\r\nI'm now concerned that this is going to be overly complex - lot's of moving parts with the potential for multiple managers to claim ownership of the same object, or using some external process (ZK) to coordinate which Manager is responsible for a specific object. The Multiple Manager implementation in this PR is based off [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACCUMULO/Elasticity+Design+Notes+-+March+2023) design, which has multiple managers try to manage everything. \r\n\r\nI think there may be a simpler way as we have already introduced a natural partitioning mechanism - resource groups. I went back and looked in the wiki and you (@keith-turner ) had a very similar idea at the bottom of [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACCUMULO/Implementing+multiple+managers+via+independant+distributed+services) page. So, instead of having a single set of Managers try to manage everything, you would have a single Manager manage tablets, compactions, and Fate for all of the tables that map to a specific resource group. We could continue to have the active/backup Manager feature that we have today, but per resource group. This also solves the Monitor problem. If we look at this using the `cluster.yaml` file it would go from what we have today:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmanager:\r\n  - localhost\r\n\r\nmonitor:\r\n  - localhost\r\n\r\ngc:\r\n  - localhost\r\n\r\ntserver:\r\n  default:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  group1:\r\n    - localhost\r\n\r\ncompactor:\r\n  accumulo_meta:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  user_small:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  user_large:\r\n    - localhost\r\n\r\nsserver:\r\n  default:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  group1:\r\n    - localhost    \r\n```\r\n\r\nto something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefault:\r\n  manager:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  monitor:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  gc:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  tserver:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  compactor:\r\n    accumulo_meta:\r\n      - localhost\r\n    user_small:\r\n      - localhost\r\n    user_large:\r\n      - localhost\r\n  sserver:\r\n    default:\r\n      - localhost\r\n      \r\ngroup1:\r\n  manager:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  monitor:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  gc:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  tserver:\r\n    - localhost\r\n  compactor:\r\n    accumulo_meta:\r\n      - localhost\r\n    user_small:\r\n      - localhost\r\n    user_large:\r\n      - localhost\r\n  sserver:\r\n    default:\r\n      - localhost\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1829805334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1830417485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3990#issuecomment-1830417485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3990","id":1830417485,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5tGfRN","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-28T18:12:25Z","updated_at":"2023-11-28T18:12:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> What test were you running that was failing prior to this change?\r\n\r\nI noticed that BadCompactionServiceConfigIT.testUsingMisconfiguredService was failing and looked into the cause and found this issue.

I was thinking that it would make sense to promote the  `table.custom.assignment.group` property to a fixed property. Users would set this property on a table and would need to define a resource group with the same name so that the Manager could manage its tablets. Clients that connect to the Manager to perform table operations or initiate user Fate transactions would need to use the table property to determine which Manager to connect to (using the Resource Group name). The resource group name is already part of the ServiceLock object, so for example, we would modify `ClientContext.getManagerLocations` to iterate over the Managers in ZooKeeper and return the one with the correct resource group. Another option, if resource groups are a first class citizen, is to put the resource group name in the ZK path although that could lead to needing cleanup if a resource group was created and then removed.
