Explore_json should take in the full form_data and if someone in the future wants that feature they should add another endpoint that's similar to explore_json but calls `get_form_data(use_slice_data=True)`.\r\n\r\nI tried to only use the request.url when deciding whether to include the slice params but that breaks saving because the url is `/explore/` but `use_slice_data` should be False. This didn't break the tests so I added an additional check to make sure `assert slc.viz.form_data == form_data`.\r\n\r\nI updated the tests so they don't use overrides with explore_json calls, and instead make calls with full form_data. In your change Max, slc.form_data adds datasource to the form_data before returning it, but slc.viz.form_data does not contain datasource because we just set it to the slice params. So also changed tests to use slc.form_data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/401466199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/401472953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5265#issuecomment-401472953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5265","id":401472953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTQ3Mjk1Mw==","user":{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T21:01:15Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T21:01:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch, isn't [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/d483ed121ca0fc5b90eac65f5e39cd6cc9359331/superset/assets/src/explore/visTypes.js#L266) enough?
