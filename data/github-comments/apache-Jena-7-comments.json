It's what's in it. There are specific headers in an OSGi version of MANIFEST.MF that support the sophisticated module-dependency management that OSGi does. For example, there are headers that explain what packages are exported from the module in question, and which are imported. If you don't need them (because you aren't using OSGi), no problem. You just ignore them, and most of us do, most of the time. But OSGi needs those headers to use the JAR as a module. As to whether all of our dependencies have it, I don't know, but it honestly wouldn't surprise me. It's so easy to include these days (autogenerated) that many, many projects do it by default. On the other hand, since `jena-osgi` is packaging up some dependencies internally, than it doesn't matter whether those guys do, because OSGi is not managing those guys. And those dependencies that `jena-osgi` is not packaging up internally certainly _do_ have the metadata (e.g. `httpcore-osgi`).\nSo one thing we could do here would be to have `jena-osgi` shade in the Dexx library the way it currently shades in, e.g. `xercesImpl`. But that's kind of hacky. I think the right thing to do here is work upstream and help Dexx get that little bit of metadata packed in, and then the job is done cleanly and forever.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/206433254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/206447863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/135#issuecomment-206447863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/135","id":206447863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjQ0Nzg2Mw==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-06T16:19:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T16:33:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"DISREGARD: SEE NEXT COMMENT.\n\nThis PR would pull in Kotlin's runtime to the dependencies, because Dexx Collections has moved to Kotlin for current versions.

We might think of providing different distributions in the future each one defined by own feature. It has been reused to define the bundle set for the integration test:\n\n```\n              ... features(maven().groupId(\"org.apache.jena\")\n            .artifactId(\"jena-osgi-features\").type(\"xml\")\n            .classifier(\"features\")\n            .version(\"3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"), \"jena\") ...\n```\n\nWhile testing I was reminded harshly why I removed xerces from the bundle earlier: Apache Karaf (3\\* and 4*) ships with endorsed xerces 2.11.0 and exports it per default to any installed bundle via boot delegation. The bundle cant's suppress (not import) these classes, resulting in 2 versions available and tests failing with: \n\n```\nCaused by: java.lang.VerifyError: (class: org/apache/xerces/impl/dv/xs/AbstractDateTimeDV, method: <clinit> signature: ()V) Bad type in putfield/putstatic\n    at org.apache.xerces.impl.dv.xs.XSSimpleTypeDecl.<clinit>(Unknown Source)[:]\n    at org.apache.xerces.impl.dv.xs.SchemaDVFactoryImpl.createBuiltInTypes(Unknown Source)[:]\n    at org.apache.xerces.impl.dv.xs.SchemaDVFactoryImpl.<clinit>(Unknown Source)[:]\n    at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)[:1.8.0_05]\n    at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:62)[:1.8.0_05]\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)[:1.8.0_05]\n    at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:408)[:1.8.0_05]\n    at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:433)[:1.8.0_05]\n    at org.apache.xerces.impl.dv.ObjectFactory.newInstance(Unknown Source)[:]\n\n```\n\nAs expected, these configurations were proved to work:\n1.

This could be done with an iterator wrapper that copies what it sees. This could also help with the fact that there is no control on the results - e.g. if the results are very long, it all gets cached.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages:\n1. +ve : If the same query with made with a different \"Accept\" header, there is no cache hit and the query results are cached twice.\n2. +ve : The copying iterator can have some policy controls like limiting caching results to N,000 rows. For robustness reasons, we probably want some limits here so as not to cache the dataset by accident.\n3. -ve : the results are serialized each time.  Talking to Jetty at all is going to be slower than Vanish and this adds to that. \n4. +ve : A bonus is that LIMIT/OFFSET can be done (a later feature) if the full results are executed.  If the query is LIMIT/OFFSET+ORDER (to get stablity - a common idiom), the exact query isn't being repeated but it is an expensive query.  Note this is alreay optimized by a TopN query so the interactions here are complicated but if a repeat results iterator is available, different LIMIT/OFFSET can be done.\n\nQuestions and specific points on this PR:\n1.

There are cheaper ways to get \"rewindable-ity\", such as have been mentioned (`ResultSetMem implements ResultSetRewindable` could be used, although the threading issues would need some work and it might be better to work from some fresh interface).

When the query is executed first time then resultset iterator is obtained and stored as value in the cacheEntry. Once the resultset is iterated and written in OutputStream the data stored as value in cacheEntry.In case of badly behaving client if one OutputStream is closed the behaviour need to be tested for other OutputStream.\n2. SPARQL_Query_Cache checks if cacheEntry is present and if it contain data then set operation as READ_CACHE and ResponseResultSet writes the cache value in OutputStream. If cacheEntry is null then it delegates the responsibility of creation of cacheEntry to SPARQL_Query. SPARQL_Query executes the query, generates the cache key and initializes the cacheEntry with key as query key and value as resultSet.\n\nRegards\nSaikat \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/212563381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/212574093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-212574093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":212574093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjU3NDA5Mw==","user":{"login":"samaitra","id":369459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/369459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra","html_url":"https://github.com/samaitra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-20T19:40:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T19:40:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@osma \n\nHi Osma\n\nInitially I had implemented the caching mechanism based on storing the resultSet in cache but the challenge was once the resultSet is exhausted then it will be closed and then when the cache hit happens the resultSet was no longer iterable as it was closed.\n\nGuava cache do not provide limit over cache size in terms of memory but on number of entries or a relative weight of entry that can be cached.

This became quite an experiment and I'm reporting the results here.\n\nFirst of all I needed a realistic dataset and sets of queries. I decided to use four of the SKOS datasets we serve at Finto.fi, together with SPARQL queries performed by the Skosmos application. I used the Skosmos [performance test suite](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos/tree/master/tests/performance) to generate a set of 36k SPARQL queries that do not involve the jena-text index (for simplicity), of which 22% are CONSTRUCT queries and the remainder are SELECTs. There are 24k unique SPARQL queries in that set and they should be a fairly realistic approximation of queries that we actually encounter.\n\nTo give caching a chance, I considered each query twice and then took a random sample of 20k of the resulting 72k queries. This revised set has 14k unique queries, i.e. 30% of the queries are repetitions of previously seen queries. This is a rather difficult data set for caching, since there is so much variation - enough to completely fill the cache of 10000 query results. An ideal cache that stored everything and served requests with zero overhead would be able to obtain a 30% hit rate and a corresponding 30% decrease in average query time.\n\nI loaded the four SKOS datasets into named graphs of a TDB, as we usually do with Skosmos. I gave Fuseki 6GB of memory (`export JVM_ARGS=-Xmx6G`). I ran the tests on a Core i3-2330M laptop with 8GB RAM and an SSD running Ubuntu 14.04 64bit and OpenJDK 8. I tested four different Fuseki2 configurations:\n- vanilla: current 2.4.0-SNAPSHOT\n- jena-626: current snapshot after applying this PR\n- jena-626-1k: same as above, but reducing the cache size to 1000\n- varnish: same as vanilla, but with a 256MB in-memory, gzip-compressing Varnish cache in front\n- jena-626-varnish: same as jena-626, but with Varnish cache as above\n\nI ran the 20000 queries using a test script that prints out status information after every 1000 queries. This includes the average query response time in the previous 1000 requests and the current Fuseki memory usage, as indicated by the RSS value in `top` command output.\n\nThe results are in a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JY-vNW-iEmiGGVWl-D6It9lWHR65CkkdN2mQyWycWO8/edit?usp=sharing) and summarized in this diagram:\n![chart](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1132830/14738105/76d9ae42-0888-11e6-8920-b7c81428d053.png)\nThick lines indicate memory usage, thin lines response time. Unfortunately I couldn't get the diagram to show legends for all the setups - blue is vanilla, yellow is jena-626, purple is jena-626-1k, green is varnish, red is jena-626-varnish.\n\nOne immediate finding is that Fuseki memory usage fluctuates a lot, so it is very difficult to measure accurately. I didn't have the patience to run this multiple times, so the values are very rough estimates. For comparison figures, I used the average memory usage of the 10 final measurements (i.e. when the 10000 item cache should be full, or nearly so). Response time measurements are much more consistent.\n\nCompared to vanilla, the other configurations have\n- jena-626: 22% better performance, memory usage +480MB\n- jena-626-1k: 9% better performance, memory usage +110MB\n- varnish: 30% better performance, memory usage unchanged (but Varnish used 100MB at the end)\n- jena-626-varnish: 27% better performance, memory usage +130MB (plus Varnish 100MB)\n\nObservations:\n- Long-term memory consumption may increase by hundreds of megabytes with this patch. **I think that the current cache size of 10000 items is too high.** A default size of 1000 would bring almost half the performance benefits with much lower memory usage.\n- Varnish is very close to the ideal cache here. It beats this query cache hands down. Also it appears that a 256MB cache using gzip compression could fit at least 30000 query results.\n- For setups which already use Varnish, this query cache only increases memory consumption, with no improvement in performance. **It should be possible to turn this cache off.**\n\nOther thoughts:\n- I'm quite often optimizing SPARQL queries, and when doing that I'm interested in worst-case (cold cache) performance. A cache like this would make this very dificult, as sometimes cached responses would be served very fast. I think that the cache should respect the `Pragma: no-cache` HTTP header as well as similar HTTP 1.1 `Cache-control` headers so that it is possible to avoid caching for specific queries.\n\nI put the scripts, queries and data in a [tarball](http://tester-os-kktest.lib.helsinki.fi/jena-626-performance.tar.gz) (100MB) in case someone wants to play around with the test suite. If the implementation of this cache is changed to e.g. store ResultSets instead of serializations, then the tests can be run again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213367009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213467383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-213467383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":213467383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzQ2NzM4Mw==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T15:10:27Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T15:10:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@osma - really great analysis and very insightful.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213467383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213468612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-213468612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":213468612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzQ2ODYxMg==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T15:14:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T15:14:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1: @osma++\nPart of the takeaway here for me is that when it comes to caching bits, we're unlikely ever to do as well as specialist tools that have been carefully worked on and optimized.

No configurability.\n\nThe classes changed are: `HttpAction`, `ResultsCache`, and `SPARQL_Query` to use the cache. `SPARQL_Query` has operations `processViaCache`, `prepareForCache`, `insertIntoCache`. \n\n1:: It deals with two concurrent attempts to set the by letting them both run (it's the same answer right?!) and set the cache.\n\n2:: The cache is invalided when `HttpAction.beginWrite` is called so all update routes are caught (SPARQL Update, GSP and the Uploader). I don't like that - it seems asymmetric that `beginWrite` is used and it assumes MR+SW.\n\nCache actions are logged `** Cache`.  The actual implementation of `ResultsCache` is just some code to do something.\n\n**Space**\n\nIf the query result (not the serialization) is stored, I would expect the memory footprint will be less because of sharing nodes with the original dataset.  Any graph pattern matching variable ends up with the node-by-reference.  Calculated expressions are fresh nodes. Long literals are shared.\n\nLiterals from the data are not extra cost in memory. Let's assume that calculated nodes are small.  This is usually true - but they may be a lot of them.\n\nThe calculation of the memory cost, is now approximated by the total number of cells in the results, i.e approximate with \"num of rows \\* num of columns\" and it can be calculated while capturing the `ResutlSet` copy.  We could put limits on the size of results sets cached and on total number of cells.\n\nSerialized results can easily sized.  They do not share space though.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nWe need some configuration control, both server-wide on the `fuseki:Server` object in config.ttl and on each service.  Or use \"Context\" - caching is import so my suggestion is have properties to cl;early set values.  \n\nThe server-wide case is, I think, less important. I suggest putting the configuration on service, not the dataset, so you can have two different policies, like cached and not-cached, on the same data. \n\nThe default should be \"no caching\".\n\nThe having two services addresses the \"cold cache/development\" use case.\n\nWe should still obey `Pragma: no-cache` and `Cache-control` but there are quite a lot of options and details so it might be wise to not aim to have everything for a first release, especially if caching is default off.\n\n**Other**\n\nRelated-but-different observation: supporting conditional-GETs would be very good.  Just keep an epoxy number/timestamp for each dataset.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213496231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213500724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-213500724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":213500724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzUwMDcyNA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T16:33:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T16:33:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On the question of conditional-GET, there has been some [discussion](https://pony-poc.apache.org/thread.html/Zdrf49p8jphmwje) about ETags in this connection that might be helpful.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213500724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/213564399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-213564399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":213564399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzU2NDM5OQ==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T19:40:05Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T19:40:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ajs6f said:\n\n> If Jena is going to do really useful caching, it's going to be caching something other than bits, something specific to what Jena does, like node-tuples or result rows or the like.\n\nThere are indeed some things a Jena-specific cache can do better than a general purpose cache such as Varnish. Many have already been mentioned, but to recap:\n1. The cache can be aware of changes in the underlying data and keep responses \"forever\", but invalidate them immediately when data changes. An external cache has to be manually purged. (Supporting ETag, Last-Modified, conditional GETs etc. would help automatically invalidate an external cache though)\n2. If the cache is on a ResultSet level, things like providing different serializations for the same result and paging become possible.\n3. The cache can be aware of the cost of executing the query. Holding on to a result that can be recalculated from the data in 5ms is basically a waste of memory. Perhaps the cache, when it has to evict older results, could prefer keeping results that took a long time to generate. Or there could be a threshold that determines what to cache - e.g. don't keep anything that was generated in less than 10ms.\n4. An external cache is always more infrastructure to set up and maintain, and configuring a general purpose HTTP proxy is not exactly trivial. Even if I intend to use Varnish in production, this kind of integrated cache could be very useful in development and testing.

for the PR!\n\nThe code looks good, as you say it's following the pattern established by JENA-1134.\n\nYou are right about the unit tests - the inheritance hierarchy of analyzer-related unit tests is rather messy. There is a very long inheritance chain and e.g. TestDatasetWithAnalyzingQueryParser  indirectly inherits from TestDatasetWithKeywordAnalyzer. There is actually a sort of logic here, because the tests specified in TestDatasetWithKeywordAnalyzer will also be run on the subclasses, as the analyzer configurations are compatible. This gives us some unit tests \"for free\".\n\nI did some reorganizing of the test classes, namely, I abstracted out AbstractTestDatasetWithAnalyzer from TestDatasetWithKeywordAnalyzer (see https://github.com/apache/jena/commit/8a20f238ffc5aed23648b038132fe74cbca2c85c). Unless I'm missing ssomething, you should now be able to inherit from AbstractTestDatasetWithAnalyzer and avoid doing the full makeSpec in your test class. Would you mind switching over to that?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/219381471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/219598981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/146#issuecomment-219598981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/146","id":219598981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTU5ODk4MQ==","user":{"login":"adolby","id":6783975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODM5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6783975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby","html_url":"https://github.com/adolby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adolby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T01:51:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T01:51:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for working on that refactoring!

RDF is used to drive the UI for HTTP/HTML requests. This means we get a lot of small calls into the database for every single HTTP request. Going off machine for each call does not work.  Getting larger parts of the RDF (i.e. a few large remote calls) only gets us into having a local graph and many calls to that.\n\nWe can of course add our own caching because we control the whole stack but it suggests a design whereby caching is done by the `QueryExecution` and not as part of Fuseki HTTP request handling, either specific to Fuseki or as a general feature in ARQ.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/231579500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/231580613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/139#issuecomment-231580613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/139","id":231580613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTU4MDYxMw==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-10T09:57:55Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T09:57:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"JIRA created to track this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-1208\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/231580613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/231586741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/151#issuecomment-231586741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/151","id":231586741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTU4Njc0MQ==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-10T12:33:29Z","updated_at":"2016-07-10T12:33:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm imagining a bag of new methods in `HttpOp` similar to what's there now, with the additional `HttpContext` param, and the methods that are now there would call through those new methods with `null` in that slot, much like what happens now with many of the other params.

I'm not sure what to do about this short of trying to take `HttpOp` completely internal, which seems like a massive overreaction.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/231833691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232129945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/150#issuecomment-232129945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/150","id":232129945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjEyOTk0NQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T18:06:28Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T18:06:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ping @der\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232129945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232133906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/153#issuecomment-232133906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/153","id":232133906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjEzMzkwNg==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T18:19:56Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T18:19:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Merged but this code always benefits from ongoing code review!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232133906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232150266","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/149#issuecomment-232150266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/149","id":232150266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjE1MDI2Ng==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-12T19:17:02Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T19:17:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I don't have any strong feelings - I'm just following the current pattern (for better or worse).\n\nI doubt we will have name clashes (independent vocabs - not versions).\n\nThe minor downside of classifying by package is implicit domain.
