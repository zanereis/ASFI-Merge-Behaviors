What is quite confusing, is that this actually **disables** `syncAsSparkDataSourceTable`, since the default value is true. It basically just toggles the default (described here: https://github.com/cbeust/jcommander/issues/378). Maybe better to define an arity 1 for booleans so that you explicitly have to specify the value when you provide the flag (cf. https://jcommander.org/)? \r\n\r\nSo if I sync with `syncAsSparkDataSourceTable` I can't query my hive tables with spark sql. When can this then be used? Since it's on by default and queries like in the examples on the hudi website didn't work like that I feel like I missed some documentation.\r\n\r\nOther assumption: since the `syncAsSparkDataSourceTable` does not work, I still need to provide `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet=false`, right?

May be we can start with MOR table type and you can schedule multi-table deltastreamer once every 5 or 10 mins. Should achieve what you are looking for. In the mean time, we can try to see how to add continuous mode support in multi-table deltastreamer.\r\n\r\nEventhough MOR is selected in MultitablesDeltastreamer , output written is COW type. We have the similar use case ingesting 1000 tables with MOR .Submitting 1000 spark jobs in continuous run mode through Deltastreamer should not be a ideal solution . Capacity of cluster is the question here .

Hi @codope Thanks for your review and sorry for the delay response.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Do you think we can add a time-based config to retry last clustering only if some configurable amount of time has passed?\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Sorry I didn't get it. Is that means we can let users to set a retry clustering instant time?\r\n\r\n@zhangyue19921010 My point of view is that inflight clustering could mean that clustering is still in progress and taking some time. So, if users have setup clustering job as a cron with retry mode then could it be possible that even before clustering completes, retry is triggered and the job is repeatedly retrying. So, that's why I thought of having some config which will trigger retry only after some time has passed since last pending clustering. \r\n\r\nI believe most users execute this job manually and not as cron so it's not a blocker. But, let me know your thoughts about this.

Is this a limitation of the metadata table schema or of the way virtual key support is implemented?\r\n\r\nThe metadata table records are very small in size so the overhead of the hudi metadata columns is very high. Hence, virtual keys support would greatly reduce the size of the metadata table.

from `blocked-on-user` and marking as a `release blocker`. This has been reported in slack as well https://apache-hudi.slack.com/archives/C4D716NPQ/p1635490536147600. Although I haven't tried reproducing it, but my hunch is that this is because on underlying parquet issue https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/pull/560. So, after the initial write, when you later perform upsert, it fails while trying to read the original file because if the above issue. Based on the slack conversation, it seems to be reproducible when simply using `list of structs` which should be a fairly simple use-case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n |-- item_pairs: array (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- element: struct (containsNull = true)\r\n |    |    |-- additional_attributes: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- mapping_state: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- to_item_version: long (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- to_item_attributes: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- to_region_id: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- to_marketplace_id: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- to_item_id: string (nullable = true)\r\n |    |    |-- to_website_id: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is true, then we might have to upgrade the parquet version to 1.11 or 1.12 to get this fix. I will try to reproduce this on my side next week and file a jira as needed. cc @vinothchandar
