With 'ptr.getLength() > 0' is enough.\r\nAt the begining I thought that only 'o' should be checked.\r\nLater I added ptr.lenght (it was necesary for default values) without cheking if 'o != null' could be removed.\r\nFinally, as you sugest, I tested  with only  'ptr.getLength() > 0'.\r\nAnd, of course, if there is not something that I do not see, It can be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the test, in my enviroment, I tested the changes sereval times. the results are:\r\ndefault-test -> never fails\r\nParallelStatsEnabledTest ->  never fails\r\nParallelStatsDisabledTest -> never fails\r\nNeedTheirOwnClusterTests -> randon failures\r\n\r\nThose random test are not allways the same failures.\r\n\r\n for example, in my last test, the failure is in: 'PermissionNSEnabledWithCustomAccessControllerIT>BasePermissionsIT.testSystemTablePermissions:1027->BasePermissionsIT.verifyAllowed:894->BasePermissionsIT.verifyAllowed:901 » UndeclaredThrowable'.\r\n\r\nBut other time, I have 'PhoenixMetricsIT.testGlobalPhoenixMetricsForQueries:199' (now I don't know if that error was with jdk8 or jdk11)\r\n\r\nAnother time I had:\r\n'MaxConcurrentConnectionsIT.testDeleteRuntimeFailureClosesConnections:124 Found 1 connections still open. expected:<0> but was:<1>'\r\nand 'LogicalTableNameIT.testUpdatePhysicalIndexTableName_runScrutiny:215->LogicalTableNameBaseIT.test_IndexTableChange:187 » SnapshotCreation'.\r\n\r\nSumming up, in 'NeedTheirOwnClusterTests', I can't give a fault pattern, but I think the faults I have have nothing to do with the change I am proposing.\r\n\r\nFinally, when maven is going to build the report with jacoco, it allways fails (in my enviroment).\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project phoenix-core: Execution report of goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report failed: Incompatible execution data for class org/apache/hadoop/hbase/regionserver/MetricsRegionAggregateSourceImpl with id 2687434e0753a2bc. -> [Help 1]\r\n\r\n(I drop the screen log of my last execution).\r\n\r\n[PHOENIX-6583-SCREEN-LOG-IN-BUILDING.txt](https://github.com/apache/phoenix/files/7507090/PHOENIX-6583-SCREEN-LOG-IN-BUILDING.txt)\r\n\r\nI wanted to point out that, regarding test, I had lots of problems and fails when using 'openjdk version \"11.0.12\" 2021-07-20' with semi-random test failures. So I decided to change all to 'java version \"1.8.0_202\"'.\r\nSince them, I only have random failures in NeedTheirOwnClusterTests . I followed the instruction in https://github.com/apache/phoenix/blob/master/BUILDING.md . so I sugest, if it is necesary a specific jvm to compile and test, it is advisable to indicate it that file.\r\n\r\nBesides, when you ask to 'Please also fix the remaining spaces at the end of lines.', I thing that there is some king of cache with file 'phoenix-core/src/it/java/org/apache/phoenix/end2end/BinaryTypeIT.java' beacuse it was removed from the branch in the commit eae4b11.

This led to wrong results due to phoenix's explicit assumption on the salted boundaries.  Maybe a better approach for this worry is to check during create table that the table is split sanely if its salted etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/972552271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/975682009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1357#issuecomment-975682009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1357","id":975682009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs46J7nZ","user":{"login":"gjacoby126","id":5717906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTc5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5717906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126","html_url":"https://github.com/gjacoby126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-22T16:10:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T16:10:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stoty - code looks fine, but it looks like there's a build error in IndexBuildTimestampIT","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/975682009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/975690490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1356#issuecomment-975690490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1356","id":975690490,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs46J9r6","user":{"login":"gjacoby126","id":5717906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTc5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5717906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126","html_url":"https://github.com/gjacoby126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-22T16:19:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T16:19:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ArkenKiran - Looks like there are test failures (an NPE) with PhoenixIndexRpcSchedulerTest.
