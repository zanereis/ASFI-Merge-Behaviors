Finally got the unit test passed (The remaining one failure is irrelevant).\n\nActually the test failure is caused by several bugs of `SparkInterpreter`.  Here's the steps to reproduce the first issue.\n1. Use Spark2.0 and make SparkInterpeter as scoped\n2. Open note1 and run sample code  to start `SparkInterperer`, then Open note2 and run sample code to start another `SparkInterpreter`, then you will hit the following issue.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/18614389/4887684c-7dc0-11e6-9898-18fa8274be6d.png)\n\nThe root cause of this issue is that the `outputDir` should be unique otherwise the second `SparkInterpreter` instance can not find the class in the `outputDir` of previous `SparkInterpeter`.\n\nThe second bug is that we should also set `sparkSession` as null. Otherwise it won't be created in the next second `SparkInterperter`. \n\nThe  third bug is that we should disable `HiveContext` in `AbstractTestRestApi`, otherwise we will hit the issue of multiple derby instances running.

Sorry for my late response and thanks for the kind reminder.\nI tested again and checked the below issues I mentioned are gone :D\n\n> (edit interpreter -> add `one:two:1.1.1` to the dependency table -> save )\n> Two things are different with master branch. \n> 1. Only Spark interpreter throw the ng-toast error message.\n> 2. The other interpreters' status circle is looping infinitely. It need to be reload to turn to red and also don't show the ng-toast error message. \n\nBut I found another issues in the latest update. \n1. edit Alluxio interpreter -> add `aaa:bbb:1.1.1`  to the dependency field ->  go to another page like \"Credential\" or \"Configuration\" -> \n   The `ng-toast` error message is still shown as @astroshim said in the above comment. How about adding some timeout property to the message?\n2. edit Alluxio -> add `aaa:111:1.1.1` & `bbb:111.2.2.2` to the dependency field -> save \n   I think the number of errors and reasons need to be same. Currently, while the number of errors keeps increasing whenever I save the change, the only one reason \"Could not find artifact aaa:111:jar:1.1.1 in central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)\" is shown. Need to show \"Could not find artifact bbb:111.2.2.2 in central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)\" as well if we want to show the number of errors. \n\n<img width=\"1263\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-09-18 at 9 37 55 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/18615730/026b5b42-7de9-11e6-9294-c8a88687f896.png\">\n\nThe number of error should be 2 in the above case I guess.

I just found that the issue of ZEPPELIN-1458 doesn't exist in branch-0.6.  But found another issue, @jongyoul It seems creating new interpreter breaks in branch-0.6. I created a new interpreter called spark2, but will hit the following error.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/18655316/66bc48d6-7f1a-11e6-84a5-0208036e5278.png)\n\nIt looks like in branch-0.6, we still load interpreter from Interpreter.registeredInterpreters rather than InterpereterSetting. (NoteInterpreterLoader.java)\n\n```\nInterpreter.RegisteredInterpreter registeredInterpreter = Interpreter.registeredInterpreters\n          .get(group + \".\" + name);\n      if (registeredInterpreter == null\n          || registeredInterpreter.getClassName() == null) {\n        throw new InterpreterException(replName + \" interpreter not found\");\n      }\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/248182822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/248201741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1440#issuecomment-248201741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1440","id":248201741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODIwMTc0MQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T04:58:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T04:58:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Leemoonsoo  Please help review, I will add system test after #1404 is merged\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/248201741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/248204721","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1437#issuecomment-248204721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1437","id":248204721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODIwNDcyMQ==","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T05:25:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T05:25:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@randerzander can you explain a bit more, how do you think this is related.
