There are more details around this in the [release notes](https://hudi.apache.org/releases/release-0.11.0#slim-utilities-bundle) of 0.11.0.\r\n\r\nThis is due to some of the dependencies including Avro which are targeted for different versions in Spark 3.1 vs 3.2.

If you build the slim bundle jar using Spark 3.2 profile in mvn, that should work with Spark 3.2 and hudi-spark3.2-bundle.

If you still haven't figured out the right configs, [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/Tuning+Guide) is a more detailed tuning guide for upserts.

Yet tunning the memory and fraction should still make it work with small files.\r\n\r\n> compaction and cleanup: if these are heavy operations that need lots of memory then perhaps they can be tweaked\r\n\r\nTo start with, you may disable async compaction and clean services so that they don't interfere with the ingestion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1169413106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1169417122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5985#issuecomment-1169417122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5985","id":1169417122,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Fs-Oi","user":{"login":"phillycoder","id":349460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/349460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder","html_url":"https://github.com/phillycoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phillycoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-29T00:40:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T00:41:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We didn't use any older version for this project, so I am not sure if this worked with older version. we only started using version 0.10.1 version recently for our new project since it's been supported by EMR 6.6.0.
