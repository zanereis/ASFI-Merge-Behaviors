After I know how to fix it, I strange whether we still need the code of mul mod merging, because as you said know the simplifiers of analyzer is very strong, so I have a doubt that we need the code of mul mod merging because we haven't the strong simplifier at that time.\r\nFinally I simple delete the code of mul mod merging and want use official CI to see which case will fail, sorry for that because our internal CI haven't be set up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/845192858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/845215331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8092#issuecomment-845215331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8092","id":845215331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NTIxNTMzMQ==","user":{"login":"vegaluisjose","id":2478335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzgzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2478335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose","html_url":"https://github.com/vegaluisjose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vegaluisjose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-20T15:20:45Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T15:20:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi Leandro,\r\n\r\nYou are right, when I was refactoring the code I missed adding the `skip_test()` function back.

When using the graph executor this temporary area is then copied to the user real output, but in AOT that *is* the real output. \r\n\r\nWhy is this a problem? Because GMP can expand temporaries to that they can be shared. Thinking the output is a temporary it expands the output as well, but the output is not expandable in AOT (since it is provided by the user). \r\n\r\nWe were able to reproduce this with mobilenet quantized. The fix we come up with in #8096 is to remove the dependency from the GMP and use the TIR StorageRewrite pass on the runner function, which does not suffer of this problem. \r\n\r\nThe memory foot print is the same, so we basically got two birds with one stone.

So I suspect there may be something wrong with shared memory.\r\n\r\nI also translated TVM generated spv code to glsl code with spirv-cross, but the glsl code could not be compiled back to spv because that the type definitions of shared variables were missed. Then I corrected the glsl code and compiled it to spv. \r\n\r\nSo I got two spv files, one from TVM and the other from valid glsl. I compared their spirv IR, especially parts related to shared memory (workgroup variable). Conclusively, glsl-generated code lacks the `Block` decoration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Vulkan, so I'm not sure if this patch is good enough. @masahi  do you have any

Everything else good to me.  Fantastic debugging, and thank you very much!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral notes from reading over changes, and re-reading documentation for similar issues:\r\n\r\n* Do issues arise if the same struct is declared both as an interface and as a non-interface?  No, since you added the `interface_block` to the cache lookup, they would be treated as separate types.\r\n\r\n* Are there any other uses of `DecorationBlock` or `DecorationBufferBlock` that should be removed?  No, the only other use is in `DeclareStorageType`, which is only used when declaring I/O by push constants or uniform buffers, so it is fine.  That said, in the future we might want to rename `DeclareStorageType` to `DeclareIOStruct`, or add the same `interface_block` argument to it, to avoid implying that it could be used to declare a struct that isn't used for IO.\r\n\r\n* Are there any other decorations that should only be used conditionally?  Yes, `DecorationArrayStride`.\r\n  * DecorationArrayStride - Looks like if an array contains a structure decorated by `Buffer` or `BufferBlock`, then the `ArrayStride` decoration must be omitted ([ref](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/specs/unified1/SPIRV.html#_a_id_shadervalidation_a_validation_rules_for_shader_a_href_capability_capabilities_a)).  Therefore, in `GetStructArrayType`, the `DecorationArrayStride` and  should only be applied if `interface_block` is false.\r\n  * DecorationOffset - Should be used for each structure member, whether or not it is an interface type, no issues.\r\n  * DecorationDescriptorSet, DecorationBinding - Used for buffer inputs/outputs, no issues.\r\n  * DecorationBuiltIn - Used for accessing WorkgroupId and LocalInvocationId, no issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/846041537/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/846086073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8101#issuecomment-846086073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8101","id":846086073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0NjA4NjA3Mw==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-21T16:30:12Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T16:30:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
