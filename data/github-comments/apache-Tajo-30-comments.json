Also, I pushed several travis CI trigger and same failure was not appeared.\n(On the other hand, Another failure was appeared in https://travis-ci.org/apache/tajo/builds/103794425. )\nThis PR has no modification about these failured test's code. Condition difference in build-by-build has no relation about this PR, I guess. It means, I find no evidence yet about this problem. Can I get some advice or tip to resolve it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/173780673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/173803616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/910#issuecomment-173803616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/910","id":173803616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzgwMzYxNg==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T04:34:52Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T04:34:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, that's why I placed the test in TestHbaseTable.

You can get the query id from ResultSet which is actually the TajoResultSetBase. Once you get the query id, you can get TableDesc of the query result which includes the stat information. Here is an example.\n\n```\nResultSet res = executeQuery();\nQueryId qid = ((TajoResultSetBase)res).getQueryId();\nQueryInfo queryInfo = testingCluster.getMaster().getContext().getQueryJobManager().getFinishedQuery(qid);\nTableDesc desc = queryInfo.getResultDesc();\nSystem.out.println(desc.getStats().getNumRows());\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/192067428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/192078866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/968#issuecomment-192078866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/968","id":192078866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjA3ODg2Ng==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T03:19:19Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T03:19:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/192078866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/192083382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/965#issuecomment-192083382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/965","id":192083382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjA4MzM4Mg==","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T03:46:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T03:46:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @jihoonson ,\n\nThat's a good point.

Currently, Tajo provides a SQL grammar file as following:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/tajo/blob/master/tajo-sql-parser/src/main/antlr4/org/apache/tajo/parser/sql/SQLLexer.g4\n\nBut if we have existing grammar file and `SQLKeywords`, when other contributors add new grammar, they must add it to above two files. I think that it is a little inefficient for maintaing codes. Even though it may be trouble, if you use `SQLLexer.g4`, this patch will be better. For reference, there are some unnecessary keywords to `SQLLexter.g4` on tsql. So you need to filter theme at `TajoCli::getKeywords`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/193593546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/193639700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/965#issuecomment-193639700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/965","id":193639700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzYzOTcwMA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T07:18:10Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T07:18:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.
