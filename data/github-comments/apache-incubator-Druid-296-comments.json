The design of Druid's Kafka indexing doesn't use Kafka consumer groups (Druid manages offsets itself). So the thinking was that it shouldn't matter what the `group.id` was set to.\r\n> \r\n> If it matters for some reason, then yeah, switching those lines would be useful. Or maybe splitting the properties such that a user can override some but not others (for example, overriding `enable.auto.commit` would I think always be a bad idea).\r\n\r\nOur kafka platform must be accessed with an assigned  group.id. So I think this place may be better if \r\nhaving  more

Thanks, that was a good  read.\r\n\r\nFrom that reading, my understanding of your use case is that you could have multiple dataSources which have same set of dimension columns but different  metrics columns. I wonder how difficult \r\n was it to improve \"union query\" handling so that it could accommodate this use case. \r\nI see that you noticed that current union query handling couldn't  work with dataSources of  different schema. Did you try to improve union query handling to make that work and encountered a technical difficulty and led to conclude that namespace feature was simpler to do?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598335522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598343132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9496#issuecomment-598343132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9496","id":598343132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODM0MzEzMg==","user":{"login":"ceastman-ibm","id":25593207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTkzMjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25593207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm","html_url":"https://github.com/ceastman-ibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ceastman-ibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T18:11:40Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T18:11:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@himanshug currently i have pointing to a kubernetes service front ending a number of zookeeper pods:\r\n./_common/common.runtime.properties:druid.zk.service.host=zookeeper\r\n\r\nim not sure how having individual zookeepers listed would make those urls above work thou.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598343132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598346730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9463#issuecomment-598346730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9463","id":598346730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODM0NjczMA==","user":{"login":"JulianJaffePinterest","id":46732276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzMyMjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46732276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest","html_url":"https://github.com/JulianJaffePinterest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianJaffePinterest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T18:19:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T18:19:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We have both differing dimension and differing metrics between the namespaces. I investigated modifying union datasources as well, but there were a number of problems:\r\n\r\n1.  At the time (and perhaps still), union data sources were queried in serial, not parallel. This is obviously fixable.\r\n2. Implementing this feature with unioned data sources required implementing query logic to handle disjoin schemata, which namespacing did not.\r\n3. We've scaled this from a handful of namespaces per data source (where union data sources probably could work) to hundreds for a few (I'm not sure how easy managing 100+ data sources in a cluster would be, but this may not be a major concern)\r\n\r\nSince more changes were required for making this work with union datasources, we went with namespacing (and it was fairly simple to implement the changes described above). I see merit in both approaches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598346730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/598355639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9496#issuecomment-598355639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9496","id":598355639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODM1NTYzOQ==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T18:40:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T17:48:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"you can't point to service, druid(actually zookeeper client) needs to have all of zookeeper hosts individually listed like it is done in non-k8s deployments as well.
