Just a little more info. I noticed after opening the PR that when the processor is [listing a local directory](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/a63c3594c9dbbbbd1afcb0844b7ab0e1c3e6f171/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/ListFile.java#L135), it may work on multiple nodes while it is guaranteed that the local directory contains different files on each node. In that situation, the state is stored locally, so it doesn't matter whether the primary node changes. If I'm right, this pr is not acceptable. Instead, we could update the description accordingly and add a validation (of possible) that prevents using the processor on all nodes when the `Input Directory Location` is set to `Local`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1436033324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1436096396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6965#issuecomment-1436096396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6965","id":1436096396,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5VmReM","user":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-19T21:18:42Z","updated_at":"2023-02-19T21:18:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Lehel44 The CI build fails with Checkstyle violation in `GetShopifyIT`.

The answer may depend on the environment in which NiFi is deployed. This pull request follows through with the deprecation.

However, it makes me wonder, what is the real purpose of this property? Why is it not needed when KerberosKeyTabUserService is used? Afaik, as an alternative, it is possible to specify it in the principal property like that: `<serviceName>/<hostname>@KerberosRealmName`. Is it equivalent to having `serviceName=\"<serviceName>\" principal=\"<hostname>@KerberosRealmName\"` in the JAAS config?

Since this PR is finalized, I've opened its counterpart (https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6990) against support/nifi-1.x to add deprecation logging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1446331630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1447152658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6969#issuecomment-1447152658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6969","id":1447152658,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5WQcwS","user":{"login":"nandorsoma","id":11146937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2OTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11146937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma","html_url":"https://github.com/nandorsoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-27T21:49:26Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T21:49:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this as it became clear to me that only the description of the processor is obsolete, and it is a valid use-case to use this processor on a multi-node env with `Local` Input Directory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1447152658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1447325477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5135#issuecomment-1447325477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5135","id":1447325477,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5WRG8l","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-28T00:16:34Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T00:16:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Automated review is marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past four months.

I agree that there's utility in discussing some of the changes being made herein, it was the main driver for raising a Draft PR (rather than pushing through with more updates), so glad you noticed and thanks for commenting.\r\n\r\nI agree that an instance-based loading mechanism would make more sense and I'd been considering that as I took forward the (Docker Image-focussed, but not strictly limited) current env var approach, however I didn't want to go through making such changes without some discussion as I think there needs to be agreement on a common approach of how to load properties and what order of precedence is to be used (i.e. properties file vs. env var vs. defaults in property loader code, etc.) - this seems like it's worth a ticket in its own right (whether that's NIFI-7060 that's re-shaped *or* a new ticket to be raised).\r\n\r\nOther things that have been covered in this PR so far that we may/not want to retain:\r\n- [ ] address `shellcheck` errors/warnings in the Docker Image start scripts\r\n- [ ] load (sensitive) properties from files\r\n  - do we keep this as a Docker Image-focussed approach or look to generalise this for other deployments too (I'm not sure how much sense it makes as likely any such files are just as readable as the `nifi/-registry.properties` files themselves on such systems, but in Docker/k8s the injection of a sensitive value as a file does make things a little more secure as the values can't be seen by a simple inspection of the running container's env)\r\n- [ ] update `maven-antrun-plugin` for `dockermaven` builds\r\n- [ ] refactor the Docker Image start scripts for `nifi-registry`\r\n  - this fixed a few bugs/inconsistencies between the current `dockermaven` and `dockerhub` scripts currently on `main`, including:\r\n    - missing `needClientAuth` settings\r\n    - inability to configure the `database` for the Registry Flow Provider\r\n    - missing LDAP `Referral Strategy` config\r\n    - invalid OIDC properties (copied from `nifi`, so missing the `.registry` part of the property name *and* some properties are missing/present when unused)\r\n\r\nI'm not precious about keeping this PR open (after the discussion) and/or linking it to a different Jira ticket in future to cover the points we want to keep from this existing work vs. raising/reshaping remaining changes in NIFI-7060/a new

I could see that as either an incremental improvement, or part of a more generalized adjustment to property loading. The work around Sensitive Property Providers for loading values from secrets managers introduced some abstractions for NiFiProperties, which may need to be evaluated as part of the approach.\r\n\r\nOne of the short-comings of the current Docker container is the need to define environment variables and map them to properties in the script. This requires manual updates to support additional properties. One the major advantages of moving environment variable loading into the application would be supporting convention-based mapping. This is a standard feature of Spring Boot, and provides a good pattern. With bootstrap.conf, it should be possible to select the property sources, perhaps the default is the current file properties, but the Docker image would set the value use convention-based environment variables. NiFi Registry is the only application component that uses Spring Boot, so I'm not suggesting we need to move in that direction, just that we should able to follow the same basic idea of convention-based environment variable mapping.\r\n\r\nThose are my initial thoughts. I'm sure others like @kevdoran have some ideas along these lines.\r\n\r\nWith that, if you're interested in carving out some of these things, I think that would be useful, and we should put some thought into a new Jira issue that encompasses the goals of NIFI-7060.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1449258278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1449698876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6941#issuecomment-1449698876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6941","id":1449698876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5WaKY8","user":{"login":"nandorsoma","id":11146937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2OTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11146937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma","html_url":"https://github.com/nandorsoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nandorsoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-01T09:36:08Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T09:36:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will
