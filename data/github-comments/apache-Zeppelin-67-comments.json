Thanks for the feedback.\nI totally agree that showing `Connected` message for non-logged user can be confusing.\nI made several changes based on your opinion.\n- show user name as `anonymous` when shiro is configured as anonymous mode.(suggested by @bzz in [previous comment](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1013#issuecomment-227034217))\n- move websocket connected/disconnected text to tooltip.\n- merge two dropdown menu to one. I am also skeptical about having one more dropdown menu only for logout action. I believe with caret icon, users will easily know where to click if they wants to do some action like change settings, logout, etc.\n\n**anonymous**\n<img width=\"189\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-22 at 7 17 45 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/16289950/82191274-38ae-11e6-9209-48d058137173.png\">\n<img width=\"190\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-22 at 7 17 21 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/16289959/904a542a-38ae-11e6-8220-d2bc89feea27.png\">\n\n**authc**\n<img width=\"149\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-22 at 7 16 29 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/16289943/7aa104fc-38ae-11e6-8d26-6cb7efed09bf.png\">\n<img width=\"191\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-22 at 7 16 34 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/16289947/7eb50a0c-38ae-11e6-9aa0-fb99916b91bc.png\">\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/227934175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/227935905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1013#issuecomment-227935905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1013","id":227935905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzkzNTkwNQ==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T02:49:12Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T02:49:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@khalidhuseynov Right.
