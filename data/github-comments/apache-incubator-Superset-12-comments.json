some digging in it seems that it is indeed to the realtime server issue/bug.\nThere's a piece of code that will not extract the metadata for segments less than 24 hours.  \nAfter a day, i was able to refresh the metadata and was able to see data.\n\nWe don't use realtime, but we do a lot of small batches and then one big daily batch.  \nIt seems to be working now, but perhaps it should be documented somewhere that new data sources will not be scannable for 24 hours.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/216301714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/216302588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/423#issuecomment-216302588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/423","id":216302588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjMwMjU4OA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T17:27:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T17:27:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage
