The issue I am concerned about is what happens if the node is temporarily down and will come back up.  Before this would cause the worker to restart until it was back up (not ideal but would work).  With this patch we will end up never having the spout connect to that drpc server.\r\n\r\nI think the proper fix is actually here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/liu-zhaokun/storm/blob/d92f1a9c8d7442d4959fec57813fc5de42b179a9/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/drpc/DRPCInvocationsClient.java#L44\r\n\r\nIf instead of letting the Exception bubble up and be handled by the Spout we instead will catch/log it and set the AtomicReference to null.  This will allow the spout to do its reconnect logic periodically to try and recover, but will still keep the spout up and running if a node is completely removed.\r\n\r\nLonger term it might be interesting to try and replace the config with a location in zookeeper where the DRPC servers can register, so we can add/remove DRPC servers as needed and the system automatically adjusts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/335829958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612874163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5395#issuecomment-2612874163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5395","id":2612874163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4NzQxNjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-11T14:57:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:03:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=saurav689\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"saurav689\">Saurav Suman</a>,</p>\n\n<p>In 1.1.1 The only time that \"Giving up to schedule\" is thrown, is when the netty client is closing.

At that point you got an exception while we were closing the client. </p>\n\n<p>The later logs for Netty-server-localhost-6702-worker-1 indicate that a worker that was connected to this worker broke the connection.

The number of spouts, splitters and counters are all equal to the number of workers for simplicity.  Repeat three times.\r\nThe table below shows the average of all the experiments (except for the experiments with 8workers and 20000rate because they all failed)\r\n\r\n| Experiment | rate(tuple/s) | mean(ms) | 99%ile(ms) | 99.9%ile(ms) | cores | mem(MB) |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|\r\n| ORIGINAL | 10862.78696 | 11.12642261 | 16.76319565 | 25.67112174 | 2.1671 | 416.8698696 |\r\n|SHUFFLE | 10625.18 | 11.15462583 | 16.94839583 | 25.39703333 | 2.174539167 | 369.2407083 |\r\n|STORM-2686  | 10626.52542 | 10.40140958 | 15.68085 | 29.86079583 | 2.15822 | 378.7717542|\r\n|STORM-2686-H70L30| 10624.41 | 10.51196542 | 15.7350125 | 26.97664583 | 2.136774583 | 411.7942958|\r\n\r\nIt seems that from the result this patch did bring some benefits especially about overall 6.6% less on mean latency.  If you look at the single experiment results, this patch seems to do a better job than the original storm. \r\n\r\nSince I didn't change the critical functions, the performance of `choose a Task` should remain the same.\r\n\r\nEdit: I should have mentioned that the results in first 2 mins on every experiment are excluded from the calculation\r\n\r\nEdit again: Sadly I found there is a bug related to acker.  I ran topologies using  `storm jar xxx.jar xxx -c topology.workers=N` .  The config is not populated to `topology.acker.executors`.  So every experiment has only 1 acker no matter how many workers were running.   This influences the performance a lot.   I need to re-run all the experiments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/336592572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/336604240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2366#issuecomment-336604240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2366","id":336604240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjYwNDI0MA==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-14T02:40:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-14T02:40:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ethanlm \r\nWhen you don't set topology.acker.executors anywhere it will take default value which is same as worker count.
