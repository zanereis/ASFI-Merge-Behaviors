Feel free to add a `.md` in your plugin rood folder to do better explanation.\r\n\r\nI will take your suggesiton, and to summarize what i will do next:\r\n1. Fix `ContextHolderFactory`\r\n    For the current implentation of `ContextHolderFactory`,   if server calls another rpc, for example  A ->B(serverB) ->C(serverC),  there will have context pollution in serverB. I will test this and fix.\r\n2. Fix the failure of appveyor\r\n     Looks likedto it caused by scala codes.  First, I will try to replace these codes with java, if not, I will try to find the compatible version for related components.\r\n3. Improve comments.\r\n4.

Python is required by node-gyp. We supply a bunch of precompiled binaries with out releases so you don't have to compile them yourself.\r\n> \r\n> During the npm install process a binary is downloaded for your system. If you're on a system we haven't pre-compiled binaries for then npm will try to compile it for you, which is where python comes in.\r\n> \r\n> Since you're one linux there should be a binary for you. This likely means you're running very old version of node-sass. You should always update to the latest version of a package. Please open a new issue if you continue to encounter errors with node-sass@4.5.0.\r\n\r\nIf you live in China and your vpn is not powerful enough, npm will fail to download some precompiled binaries for dependency `node-sass` , then it will compile them itself. That's why python2 is needed.\r\n\r\nI will post an PR to guide people with network problems how to overcome this. Maybe skywalking shouldn't really care about it, but if this thing can be clarified, same kind of failure can be avoided.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/596330021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/596332576","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4465#issuecomment-596332576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4465","id":596332576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjMzMjU3Ng==","user":{"login":"tomatofrommars","id":16113120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTEzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16113120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars","html_url":"https://github.com/tomatofrommars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomatofrommars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T05:01:52Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T05:01:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> The demo commit id [8e1530d](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/commit/8e1530d4fcde5f281a5e41c5e3830ebefbf0a51a).

1. Only `ReceiverGRPCHandlerRegister` should support only server-side receiver. You could read the codes, only it has the `#addFilter` for `AuthenticationInterceptor`.\r\n\r\nDon't get your point.`ReceiverGRPCHandlerRegister` intends to add `interceptor` or `service` to `NettyServerBuilder` by invoking its `addService` method. But SSL should invoke `NettyServerBuilder#sslContext`. I don't find any link between them. Do I miss something? feel free to correct me.\r\n\r\n> 2. If we talk about the core module, you have to implement the client side TLS inside `GRPCRemoteClient`, in oder to make sure it matches the core configuration. And this TLS should be used for internal only.\r\n\r\nmake sense. I should enable client ssl at the same time. There's also a scenario for `sharing-server`, if we want to enable external SSL and disable internal SSL, client ssl needs to read config from `sharing-server` instead of `core`, right?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/596585337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/596588437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4470#issuecomment-596588437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4470","id":596588437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjU4ODQzNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T15:07:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T15:07:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"SSL for outside only could active when sharing server activated.
