Note that in python 3.8 default mode for the new process is spawn as forking on MacOS might cause crashes because threads are not safe for forking and some system libraries on MacOS run threads.

So with your change it would now do \"Executor -> Task -> Rawtask -> New Process\"? I.e. it hasn't become part of the executor I assume (that would be a no go). Just verifying.\r\n\r\nNot quite. The existing flow is:\r\n\r\nExecutor -> exec to spawn new python to run Task \"watcher\" -> spawn new python to run actual Task\r\n\r\nMy PR changes this to:\r\n\r\nExecutor -> exec to spawn new python to run Task \"watcher\" -> fork to run actual Task\r\n\r\nThe number of processes in use remains the same -- the only difference is how we create the processes, and wether we have to reload all of python and the airflow modules or not. I am happy that the same semantics and isolation is maintained.\r\n\r\nWe could also look at merging the \"watcher\" in to the executor -- the main thing the watcher does is set the task to failed if it errors, or kills it if the TaskInstance state is changed externally (i.e. the watcher is what is responsible for sending a term/kill signal to the task when you clear it in the UI).\r\n\r\nAnd yes, longer term I also want to stop the workers accessing the DB directly.\r\n\r\n(Once this is merged/working I plan to fix the Local and Celerey executors to tackle the exec vs fork  there too.)\r\n\r\nI'll try using multiprocessing to do this, \r\n\r\n> Note that in python 3.8 default mode for the new process is spawn as forking on MacOS might cause crashes because threads are not safe for forking and some system libraries on MacOS run threads\r\n\r\nSad panda. Interestingly the bug report seems to say it's been a problem since OSX 10.13, but I haven't noticed a problem on 1.014 with this

Why were the Task Handler not updated?  In my opinion, we should check the existence of the ``download_logs`` key in the implementation of the handler logic and then disable the pagination mechanism. Now the abstraction of code is running away and it is possible that we are breaking other handlers because they expected different behavior.\r\n\r\nI am working on documentation for this class and if we revert this change we will be able to do it as follows.  In my opinion this is the original behavior of this code.\r\n```python\r\nclass TaskHandler(logging.Handler, ABC):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Handler that allows you to write and read information about a specific task.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    @abstractmethod\r\n    def read(\r\n        self, task_instance: TaskInstance, try_number: Optional[int] = None, metadata: Optional[Dict] = None\r\n    ) -> Tuple[List[str], List[Dict]]:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Read logs of given task instance.\r\n\r\n        It supports log pagination. To do this, the first call to this function contains an empty metadata\r\n        object. As a result, list of logs and list of metadata should be returned. The resulting\r\n        metadata should contain the key ``end_of_logs``, which determines whether pagination should be\r\n        continued. It is possible to return more metadata objects, but only the first is used, so\r\n        you should always return a list with one item.\r\n\r\n        The remaining keys in the dictionary are sent back to the method without changes, which means that\r\n        if you add an additional key with a token or page number, you can expect that the key will be\r\n        available in the next request for logs.\r\n\r\n        If the metadata in the call contains the ``download_logs'' key, then full logs should be\r\n        returned without pagination.\r\n\r\n        :param task_instance: task instance object\r\n        :param try_number: task instance try_number to read logs from. If None\r\n           it returns all logs separated by try_number\r\n        :param metadata: log metadata,\r\n            can be used for steaming log reading and auto-tailing.\r\n        :return: a list of logs and list of metadata objects.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    @abstractmethod\r\n    def set_context(self, task_instance: TaskInstance) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Provide task_instance context to airflow task handler.\r\n\r\n        Different implementations provide different behavior. Examples of behavior are:\r\n\r\n        * in the case of handlers writing to a file, it may start writing to another file;\r\n        * for remote services, it can start adding labels to logs.\r\n\r\n        This allows us to later search for logs for a single task\r\n\r\n        :param task_instance: task instance object\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that in this PR there is a duplicate mechanism of handling the case when try_numbers is empty, i.e. the log for all try numbers is downloaded.\r\n\r\nPreviously it was part of the file_task_handler handler, and now it has been copied a second time to another place despite the es_task_handler extended from this handler.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/utils/log/file_task_handler.py#L155-L164\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/utils/log/es_task_handler.py#L36\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/www/views.py#L595-L599","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/557788417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/557797774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4935#issuecomment-557797774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4935","id":557797774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzc5Nzc3NA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T13:24:36Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T13:24:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
