we don't have any benchmarks in place. I once tried to get JMH working, but it gave a lot of issues in Eclipse. In this case, the scenario isn't that complicated: create a component with about 10000 children and remove them again. You'll notice the difference in performance. Removing all components is not a very common operation, but removing (or replacing) a few is. It's very unfortunate that LinkedHashMap does not expose methods for bidirectional traversal. It does maintain a double linked list, but the 'before' reference is internal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1004354514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1008655176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/488#issuecomment-1008655176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/488","id":1008655176,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM48HttI","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-10T08:49:18Z","updated_at":"2022-01-10T08:49:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also,

I have such a module on a branch, but had problems with the enforcer plugin complaining about the plugins I added to run the benchmarks from the command line. I need to play around with the plugin definitions and will create a separate PR if I can get it working. The main advantage is that you can checkout the sources on a (cloud) server and run the benchmarks there. For some performance optimizations in Kryo, I had benchmarks running for hours over night, to get the error rates as low as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1027257846/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1027297383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/497#issuecomment-1027297383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/497","id":1027297383,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM49O1Bn","user":{"login":"theigl","id":661800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTgwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/661800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl","html_url":"https://github.com/theigl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-01T21:18:39Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T21:18:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-6952","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1027297383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1027300865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/497#issuecomment-1027300865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/497","id":1027300865,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM49O14B","user":{"login":"theigl","id":661800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTgwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/661800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl","html_url":"https://github.com/theigl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theigl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-01T21:22:44Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T21:22:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\nBenchmark

I was going to make this a 2nd pull request, but it can go here too.\r\n\r\nThis 2nd commit greatly reduces the overhead of hashCode() computation in the rendering cycle as well.    These hashcode computations, which make calls to Objects.hash() create a temporary Object[] array, autobox the boolean and integer values, and are expensive due to this overhead.     I ran some tests on JDK17 and JDK19 using JMH and these Object[] creations are not elided in after inlining and after Escape Analysis.    One of our simplest Ajax callbacks results in 140 hashcode calls to the Abstract class.   In total, these changes avoid the creation of about 11KB of garbage memory in the server _per_mouse_click.     This code also runs in ~1ns, compared to ~15ns for the original code (on a M1 Ultra Macbook, JDK19).     On older JDKs, like JDK11, the original code is much more expensive by comparison.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1102823621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/1102826557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/512#issuecomment-1102826557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/512","id":1102826557,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM5Bu8w9","user":{"login":"astange1","id":11482072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDgyMDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11482072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1","html_url":"https://github.com/astange1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astange1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T16:01:35Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T16:01:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@theigl I just saw your note.
