They also exist as a place to store metadata which can scale.\r\n\r\nokay. if system topic is to store metadata, isn't it overlapped with the goal of building table service for metadata storage. if you just use a pure log to store metadata, we still have too much to build and most of the work is overlapped with the goal of table service. \r\n\r\nso I think we should first target system topic as a changelog of what's happening within namespace, rather than making it to replace zookeeper to store metadata.\r\n\r\n> So then it was suggested to use a system topic in pulsar. I'm questioning whether we should use a topic for policies on topics. What happens if the topic that contains the policy so has a topic policy? Maybe we need to prevent system topics from having topic level policies.\r\n\r\ngood point. I see it now.\r\n\r\n> Otherwise, we put the \"system topics\" a lower layer and we wouldn't even have this problem. I suggested managed ledger, but dlog would also work here if we want notifications.\r\n\r\nI think we should just consolidate managed ledger and dlog into one library and use it across the place. The storage layer already provide tailing as notifications, which pulsar should leverage for \"system topics\" here, maybe \"readonly broker\" in future, and even the sql segment reader optimization.

how about passing it?\r\n\r\nI read a few other code and realized that there is no other places that create `MessageId` with a topic name like this. So we don't need to worry about other places. However, this doesn't mean we are allowed to do anything here.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't have great ideas. I'd make pretty big changes If I had to cleanup.  A compromise would be introducing `fromByteArrayWithTopic` or adding `Object context` parameter to `fromByteArray`. Then you can pass `topic` and do the similar thing in it. Adding context parameter is more generic but it would require `instanceof`. I'm not sure this cost is acceptable here.\r\n\r\nProblems on current change I think are:\r\n\r\n1) Dependency for MessageId#toString()\r\nSince the format is not documented, there is no guarantee of the format. Only place where we can do this *parse* safely is inside `MessageIdImpl` class, MessageIdImpl have the raw values though. Other places should not depend on the format. Because of this reason I'd say current change is fragile. Also it requires many string operations.\r\n\r\n2) Use of Impl class\r\nAlthough you can find many places that use SomethingImpl class, depending on concrete classes is not a good idea in general. Since `ConsumerHandler` uses a build to create a consumer, it should not know what type of MessageId is required by the consumer exactly. Use of concrete classes makes changes difficult in long term.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/433059934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/433126202","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2841#issuecomment-433126202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2841","id":433126202,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzEyNjIwMg==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T16:52:30Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T16:52:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng

\r\n\r\n> Official pulsar helm chart request 15GB memory for bookeeper,zookeeper and broker\r\n\r\nthe helm chart was contributed from a production deployment in google cloud. so those values are set to pretty high. I think we can improve it by introducing 3 different groups of settings, e.g. small, medium and large. so people can choose the proper settings to deploy to their environment. I am wondering if you are interested in contributing a change to this helm chart :)\r\n\r\n> The manifest(bookie.yaml) deploy bookeeper as daemonset, why not statefulset with persistent volume claim?\r\n\r\nI think helm chart deploys bookkeeper as statefulset. https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/deployment/kubernetes/helm/pulsar/templates/bookkeeper-statefulset.yaml\r\n\r\nYou mean the kubernetes manifest here: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/deployment/kubernetes/generic/bookie.yaml#L33\r\n\r\nThe reason why it is using daemonset for generic deployment is following: as a generic deployment, people might not enable any persistent volumes enabled in their k8s environment. so for they to tryout pulsar quickly, daemonset is an easy solution to start.\r\n\r\nIn cloud environment, for example, aws and google cloud, we are recommending people deploying using statefulset.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/deployment/kubernetes/aws/bookkeeper.yaml#L67\r\n\r\nbut since k8s is now supporting local volume claim, I think we can change generic deployment to use statefulset with local volume claim. wondering if you are interested in contributing to this as well?\r\n\r\nHope this answer your question?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/433592171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/433592430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/2792#issuecomment-433592430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2792","id":433592430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzU5MjQzMA==","user":{"login":"skyrocknroll","id":426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll","html_url":"https://github.com/skyrocknroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-27T05:25:09Z","updated_at":"2018-10-27T05:25:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ivankelly https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newconsumerconfigs .
