Compared with a formal PR, it is more like a POC now. Looking forward to your suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Why this change was been made\r\nAs I commented on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6363, predicate inference is not available in VolcanoPlanner currently, so this PR tries to propose a temporary solution to help implement predicate inference.\r\n\r\n### Main changes\r\n1. Introduce a new method in RelOptUtil to implement predicate inference, which basically copies RelMdPredicates.JoinConditionBasedPredicateInference, but makes some simplifications as follows:\r\n  1.1 Because the predicate is passed directly from the join, rather than pulled up from the filter node after the predicate is pushed down, there is no need to convert RexInputRef\r\n  1.2 FilterJoinRule will classify the generated predicates, so the new method does not need to classify the predicates, and just returns the generated predicates directly\r\n2. Call this method in FilterJoinRule, just after simplifying Outer Joins\r\n3. Introduced a new configuration item in FilterJoinRule to determine whether to enable predicate inference, and turned it off by default\r\n4. Added some unit tests\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n1. Predicate inference is turned off by default, so it has no impact on the current logic\r\n2. Applicable to Inner Join, Outer Join and Semi-Anti Join","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2233314707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2233396122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3861#issuecomment-2233396122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3861","id":2233396122,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM6FHuua","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-17T13:58:07Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T13:58:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available).

@asolimando , I have seen (https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3864/commits/5165fab9438c073fef26e699f58a0ed8c8474325) that you are trying to change the heap size only for Sonar but I don't think its necessary. The 0.5g increase is very modest and I feel that it will be a positive thing overall. My previous comment was just for clarity not for requesting changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2255558085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
