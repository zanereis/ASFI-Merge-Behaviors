It would be interesting to see some support for RDF*.\r\n\r\nComments in two areas : the parser and about RDF*.\r\n\r\n**Turtle parser**\r\n\r\nThe Turtle parser in jena-core only exists for legacy and support some\r\ntests. It isn't the normal Turtle parser, and isn't spec compliant.\r\n\r\nParsing happens in RIOT org.apache.jena.riot.lang.LangTurtle. It is a\r\ncustom (hand written parser) with its own tokenizer for speed.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, we can add the tokens for RDF*, it takes some care\r\nbecause this is the same tokenizer as used for N-Triples and so\r\nspeed-critical. We may need o split of an N-Triples/N-quads tokenizer\r\nbut that wouldn't be such a bad thing anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is an example of plumbing in a new language in [ExRIOT5.java](https://github.com/apache/jena/blob/master/jena-arq/src-examples/arq/examples/riot/ExRIOT_5.java).\r\n\r\n**RDF\\* and RDF**\r\n\r\nRDF* has the notion of a triple id: each triple has a unique id which makes it different to reification. An RDF* grah can be written in RDF and the result and back in again by using exactly one for a\r\ntriple and the process can be reversed.  This equates to the triple id of RDF* with information in the\r\nstrict RDF graph.  It's not a general RDF graph.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to RDF-merge to such graphs - that would end up with two bnode-reificiations and statements in one graph about the triple will not RDF*-merge with the statements in the other graph (which is the whole point of RDF reification).\r\n\r\nMerging needs to respect the additional RDF* data model.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n<< :s :p :o >> :addedBy \"Alice\" .\r\n<< :s :p :o >> :addedBy \"Bob\" .\r\n```\r\nMy understanding of RDF* is that this is one triple `td = :s :p :o` with two\r\ntriples with the same subject. `td :addedBy \"Alice\" . td :addedBy \"Bob\" .`.\r\n\r\n**SPARQL**\r\n\r\nThe `<< >>` syntax has a long history - it was first used in early SPARQL discussions but never made it to the final stages. It may only existed on the mailing list; teh WG decided not to have reification syntax.  However, there are some remains in the SPARQL grammar in ARQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/342616665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/343582583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/299#issuecomment-343582583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/299","id":343582583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzU4MjU4Mw==","user":{"login":"hartig","id":584467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDQ2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/584467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig","html_url":"https://github.com/hartig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-10T20:51:50Z","updated_at":"2017-11-10T20:51:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mschroeder-github for taking the initiative of writing an RDF* parser for Jena!\r\n\r\n@afs Before responding to some of your comments, I should mentioned that I am still actively working on RDF* and SPARQL* even if I am having hardly any time for writing code in my new position. Anyways, I have recently published [a paper with formal results about RDF*/SPARQL*](http://olafhartig.de/files/Hartig_AMW2017_RDFStar.pdf). Additionally, two weeks ago I presented the approach as a poster in ISWC 2017 and won the \"peoples' choice best poster award\" for it. Now, to your comments:\r\n\r\nYou are right, an RDF* graph is not an RDF graph, but it can be transformed into an RDF graph (by applying the RDF reification vocabulary or some other pure-RDF approach such as singleton properties or single-triple named graphs). The aforementioned paper provides the formal mappings for such transformations and shows that these mappings have desirable properties (they are information preserving and query result preserving).\r\n\r\nHowever, you are not right when you write that \"RDF* has the notion of a triple id.\" There is no such notion in RDF* (unless you consider the triples themselves as triple identifiers).\r\n\r\nRegarding your example that you introduce when you write about merging, you are right: these are two RDF* triples that have the same subject and this subject happens to be the triple (`:s`,`:p`,`:o`).\r\n\r\nIn your comment related to SPARQL you write that the `<< >>` syntax has been discussed in the SPARQL WG. Was this discussion related to reification or was the idea of the `<< >>` syntax in this discussion for something else?\r\n\r\nIn general, I understand your response to this PR as a positive attitude towards supporting RDF* syntax (and SPARQL* syntax?) in Jena, plus a suggestion to implement this support as part of RIOT instead of the jena-core Turtle parser.
