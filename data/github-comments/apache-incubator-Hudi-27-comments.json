I see we have pretty much copied over the english content onto the .cn.md files here.. In relation to chinese docs, do you plan to rewrite these .md files one by one? whats the plan here? If not, I am wondering if there is a simpler way to provide chinese nav bars alone\r\n\r\nThis plugin needs the naming style of `xxx.cn.md` if we need to provide a Chinese doc version for `xxx.md`. IMO, it's a good way to decouple the other language doc with the English doc. It's a good choice, Apache Flink and Kylin also chose it. Trust me, I will try my best to maintain the Chinese doc. The plan is described in issue HUDI-211. When we start the translation, one document one subtask. I will help to translate and review those docs.\r\n\r\n> The theme changes look good - removing github-pages etc.. On `include` , does it mean we no longer have the ability to include html files ? I was actually hoping to use them to redo parts of the demo page.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I have tried to figure out why it does not allow `include` grammar in `.md` files. But I am not a Jekyll and ruby expert, I can not find the reason. Coincidentally, I also do not find `include` grammar been used in the `.md` file of Flink docs. However, we still can use this grammar in `.html` file. \r\n\r\nIMO, it's not a serious question, we can find a good solution to reuse the partial page. In addition, I will also try to refactor the structure of the document with one menu one folder, I think it's a better way to host more and more docs.

Actually, with cleanups to pom from @thesuperzapper and me already merged to master, its good time to start on this, if anyone has cycles. \r\n\r\nI am trying to redo the bundles, further thin them out (e.g: hive-jdbc standalone jar brings in a ton of classes into utilities-bundle) and make parquet/avro to be picked up from spark and not from hudi. After that, this is next on my plate - test across spark versions 2.1 - 2.4 and ensure things still work.

I think I know the reason why you are not seeing the issue. If you could kindly include partition in your setup, you should see the issue too. As I suggested in the initial report, this issue is only reproduced if there is a partitioned hive table involved. \r\n\r\nSteps: (Let the schema be: id, name, team)\r\n\r\n1. Insert data into certain partition (eg: p1) -> (1, kabeer, hudi | 2, vinoth, hudi)\r\n2. Delete record (1, kabeer, hudi)\r\n3. Upsert a new record: (3, balaji, hudi)\r\n\r\nPlease treat the partition column as team column and kindly ensure that the hive table partition path in which all the 3 records should be <base_path_of_table>/team. \r\n\r\nNow when you query the table. You should expect to see the records vinoth and balaji. But you would only see balaji. \r\n\r\nSome additional information based on your setup:\r\nI have repeated the above test setup by making partition column as id column - i.e. all the records land in their own partition columns based on their ID - so kabeer lands in partition 1, vinoth in 2 and balaji in partition 3. \r\nSince the record that gets deleted is kabeer, I am successfully able to see Vinoth and Balaji. So I am now convinced that for a table in a given partition, an upsert followed by delete will cause all previous records to vanish away. \r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nThe upsert routine that I use after insert and delete is the same. I can confirm that upserts after insert land me with expected behaviour which goes on to indicate that I am not doing savemode.overwrite It is only after delete that there is an issue. \r\n\r\nHopefully when you extend your setup with partition information of the table, we can confirm that the issue exists. I am very grateful to you for all  your support. Eagerly looking forward to see your further findings.

Could you give that a quick shot? \r\n\r\n> Configure spark.jars property in to the jars /../hudi-spark-bundle-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar,/../spark-avro_2.11-4.0.0.jar\r\n\r\nIs dropping jars into spark's own jars folder the recommended way of installing datasources? On the flip side, what are the downsides to configuring `spark.jars` for the EMR spark installation? That seems like a cleaner approach. Is the problem that when user jobs do `--jars` this setting gets overridden? \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/527257031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/527316262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/859#issuecomment-527316262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/859","id":527316262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzMxNjI2Mg==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T06:00:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T06:00:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the detailed explanation.
