@byungwok . This does not appear to be an Accumulo issue. It may be related to Cloudera CDH or Geowave, but this is not the right forum to get support for either of those (I suspect both of those have their own community forums for support, but I don't know what they are). Also, please note that Accumulo 1.7.x is not an actively maintained version of Accumulo. You should probably upgrade to the latest, 1.9.2, unless you are receiving support for the earlier version from your vendor.\r\n\r\nFrom the exception, it looks like either 1) the jar file is corrupt, 2) you don't have the appropriate unzip library installed on your system to unpack the jar, or 3) the file system permissions to do not permit your accumulo process to read the jar. It's also possible that the issue was fixed in commons-vfs2-2.1, which I know has some bug fixes in it, and you may be able to put on your class path in place of commons-vfs2-2.0, but I can't be certain it will fix this specific issue.\r\n\r\nHopefully the above suggestions will help. However, I'm closing this issue, since it does not appear to be a problem with Accumulo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/430199549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/430285731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/691#issuecomment-430285731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/691","id":430285731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDI4NTczMQ==","user":{"login":"adamjshook","id":1372828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzI4Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook","html_url":"https://github.com/adamjshook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjshook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-16T15:35:44Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T15:35:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dlmarion Could you take a look at this as well?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/430285731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/430297263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/701#issuecomment-430297263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/701","id":430297263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDI5NzI2Mw==","user":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-16T16:06:17Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T16:06:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The error message is wrong.

Copy back the MapReduce code from the new client-mapreduce module back into core.client to preserve backwards compatibility of core.\r\n2. Rename the new client-mapreduce packages to avoid conflicting with the old ones\r\n3. Remove the dependency for client-mapreduce from test pom since test is now using the old ones again.  This commit also had sorting and formatting cleanup for the new package names.\r\n\r\nThis will build on the work already done without breaking things.
