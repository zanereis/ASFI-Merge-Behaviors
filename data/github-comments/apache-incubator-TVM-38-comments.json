This means we can choose ordering according to different criteria, and apply AutoTVM style techniques to explore pass ordering, and fusion settings. \r\n\r\nMy observation from talking with of users is that fusion decisions have a huge effect on end-to-end performance of the system, and is something we probably want fine grained control over for tuning programs for specific platforms. \r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to apply fusion multiple times.

I have a PR at #1548 which adds another stage of fusion. Since I didn't modify existing fusion algorithm at all, it can be implemented as a separate function/pass on graph. It should be cleaner that way. If later someone comes up with another fusion rule, we don't want to add another big block of code after existing one.\r\n\r\nMy fusion rule assumes that the existing fusion algorithm has already been applied, so it introduces dependency between fusion rules there.\r\n\r\nI am also interested in applying fusion multiple times. My fusion rule has a restriction that, children nodes which branch from a single parent node cannot have multiple child nodes (or branch). I think I can get around this problem by some kind of iterative, or progressive fusion strategy, where first round fuses the children nodes at depth 2 and the second round fuses the children nodes at depth 1 and a group of nodes fused by the first round , etc. ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/410503780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/410520795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1541#issuecomment-410520795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1541","id":410520795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDUyMDc5NQ==","user":{"login":"sanallen","id":7547607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDc2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7547607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen","html_url":"https://github.com/sanallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-05T13:38:06Z","updated_at":"2018-08-05T13:38:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen I understand your question, hope @eqy can give me some suggest","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/410520795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/410579417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1378#issuecomment-410579417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1378","id":410579417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDU3OTQxNw==","user":{"login":"siju-samuel","id":15828974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODI4OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15828974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel","html_url":"https://github.com/siju-samuel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T03:33:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T03:33:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the support.
