Also looking at the Blogs they suggest a fixed Threadpool instead of a ForkJoin Threadpool (which the \"standard\" Scala thread pool is) for blocking I/O code.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, looking at your PR, you are importing the standard Scala execution context in the methods that still use blocking via Await.result. What about using a separate Threadpool there whose size is either configurable or you pass it as a parameter. Passing as a parameter though is breaking the current contract and is a little bit strange since the method does not return an async instance (e.g. Future) which I would expect from a scala method which needs an ExecutionContext param.\r\n\r\nVery interested what you think!

With \"nearly\" I mean that an engine implementor has to add \"override\" to its implementation of predictBase() / predict(), when he recompiles/changes his engine. Because in this suggestion I implement it with a default NotImplementedError stating that the method is deprecated. But this should only be necessary when the engine developer recompiles his engine. With that \"override\" hint he then also gets a good hint to move on to the new async implementation. Already compiled engines should still work as the simply override the new default impl. of predict/predictBase. predictBaseAsync and predictAsync simply delegate to the old methods and wrapping a blocking block around it to tell the standard scala execution context to execute them in a second, much bigger threadpool. See chapter \"Blocking\" from https://www.beyondthelines.net/computing/scala-future-and-execution-context/\r\n\r\nIf you want we could just drop this default implementation of BaseAlgorithm.predictBase / Subclass.predict and would have 100% compatibility but then even a new async implementation would have to implement these old method signatures with a dummy.\r\n\r\nOther solution I did think of were using some runtime information (things like checking dynamically if a method is present or not) but I decided not to use that, because these kind of lookups are usually very slow and IMHO breaks type saftey.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/437362562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/438855500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/499#issuecomment-438855500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/499","id":438855500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODg1NTUwMA==","user":{"login":"Wei-1","id":10698262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjk4MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10698262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1","html_url":"https://github.com/Wei-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wei-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-14T23:18:06Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T23:18:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
