To me, this contradicts the general semantics of Java...\n- But anyhow in that case, transient fields end up `null` so I had to make the types non-transient.\n- But even though `TypeDescriptor` is serializable, `TypeVariable` is not (this is why they were transient in the first place). And this fix is _specifically_ for cases where both the input type and output type contain type variables.\n- So I \"swapped the polarity\" on whether the underlying transform stashes a `SimpleFunction` or a `SerializableFunction` plus type descriptors.\n- That broke display data for a minute, since it looked directly at the classes, and in the process of fixing that, I just added display data to the functions. The fix didn't actually require this latter bit.\n\nSo this is my best approach to getting a good `TypeDescriptor` for both input and output without every having to serialize them.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/236092057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/236092146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/757#issuecomment-236092146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/757","id":236092146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjA5MjE0Ng==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T04:30:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T04:30:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"R: @bjchambers AND @swegner \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/236092146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/236092453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/699#issuecomment-236092453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/699","id":236092453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjA5MjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T04:33:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T04:33:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It passed for a second :-)\n\nBut it had conflicts.

It seems like you pulled from `master` and `python-sdk` branches at different times. Could you clean up your change a little bit?
