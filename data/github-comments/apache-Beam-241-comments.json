@aaltay\r\n\r\nHey @chuanyu, thank you for your first contribution. I believe `typing` module is only available in python 3.5+, Beam Python SDK currently does not support Python 3. And this change should happen together with a grand change that upgrades all of SDK to support Python 3. Would you be interested in doing that? If you are interested, a good step would be preparing a plan and sharing with the dev list.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I do not think we should do this change in isolation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/319531796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/319531915","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3607#issuecomment-319531915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3607","id":319531915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTUzMTkxNQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T00:15:35Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T00:15:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage

@aaltay, thanks for the quick reply! The `typing` module has actually been [backported to pre-3.5 versions](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/typing/3.6.1), and type annotations are even available in Python 2.7 and up as type comments. It would be useful to be able to use the `typing` module types for Beam typehints as well, especially when the types are complicated. \r\n\r\nNo worries if you'd prefer not to include this change in isolation - perhaps use of typing in pre-3.5 is not common enough for this to be a frequent request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/319788714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/319796378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3648#issuecomment-319796378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3648","id":319796378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTc5NjM3OA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T20:57:57Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T20:57:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
