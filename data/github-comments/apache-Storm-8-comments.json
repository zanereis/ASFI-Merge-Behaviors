This is how clojure does ahead of time compiling.  There are also shaded thrift7 classes in the jar.  So I concede that storm-core could be considered an uberjar. I don't consider it as such because clojure does not automatically go off of the precompiled versions.  If you include a jar in the classpath that has the corresponding .clj files in it, clojure will dynamically compile them and they will be used for execution.  Also as Derek and I both said it really depends on the order of the classpath when the topology is launched.  It does not matter if storm-core has lots of stuff in it, if something else overrides them and is on the classpath first.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways to isolate dependencies.  We can do like what JBoss or OSGI do and have a classloader for user code separate from the one the system uses.  This is painful to get right, and my personal opinion would be to leave it up to the experts and integrate storm with an existing OSGI framework, but this can be kind of heavy weight.  If there are some OSGI experts or class loader gurus out there that would like to volunteer to help out with this we would gladly accept your contributions.</p>\n\n<p>The route I would go with is to remove everything from the classpath that is not needed by the worker and then shade what is left that can be shaded.  This is also not a trivial task, and as such even though it has been a known issue for a very long time we have not taken any real decisive steps to fix this.  Even Hadoop has only recently taken steps trying to add in their own class loaded for user code, it falls over in a number of different situations, and is off by default.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4015#issuecomment-2612444563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4015","id":2612444563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NDQ1NjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-16T16:03:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:43:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user dschiavu closed the pull request at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/73\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/73</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4015#issuecomment-2612444567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4015","id":2612444567,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NDQ1Njc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-16T16:14:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:43:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user dschiavu reopened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/73\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/73</a></p>\n\n<p>    Treat command line \"-c\" option number config values as such (<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-173\" title=\"use \"-c \" command to define Number config value will generate ClassCastException\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-173\"><del>STORM-173</del></a>)</p>\n\n<p>    This fixes the `ClassCastException` when submitting numeric config values using the `storm` utility's `-c` option.<br/>\n    It works by first checking if the `-c` configuration value is numeric (via Apache Commons' `NumberUtils#isNumber`) and, if positive, converting it to a numeric type.
