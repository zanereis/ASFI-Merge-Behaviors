@zjffdu for the improvement. \r\n\r\nOverall looks good to me. I'd like to see CI goes green before merge while it change code a lot.\r\n\r\nOne question. Let's say in the future, zeppelin have capability to run interpreter as a container in the remote machine for scalability. For example, run interpreter in in k8s cluster or docker host in remote machine. Initiating communication between ZeppelinServer and interpreter will require firewall setup, port export/mapping on container service.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the simplest connectivity model in this case?\r\n\r\nI guess initiating one connection from Interpreter -> ZeppelinServer is simplest way? Because of interpreter running in container on remote host doesn't need to allow incoming connection (no firewall, container port mapping). Only single known port of ZeppelinServer need to accept the connection from all interpreters running remotely. Will there be other connectivity model keep network configuration simple?\r\n\r\nWith the consideration with connectivity model that minimize user's network configuration, what would be the future direction of bidirectional rpc between ZeppelinServer and Interpreter?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/392120325/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/392128804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2952#issuecomment-392128804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2952","id":392128804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjEyODgwNA==","user":{"login":"Tagar","id":3013418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTM0MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3013418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-25T17:34:58Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T17:34:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thank you @Savalek \r\n\r\n@zjffdu would it be possible to merge this to master?

@zjffdu \r\n\r\nWhile reading the code of `FileSystemConfigStorage.java`, I noticed that the method `save(...)` delegates its work to `FileSystemStorage.writeFile(...)`. Interestingly, this `writeFile(...)` method has an _unused_ boolean parameter named `writeTempFileFirst`. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that this unused boolean parameter `writeTempFileFirst` is in fact a _ToDo_ that has been left here with the intention of adding the same kind of protective logic that we are discussing here.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if that is the case, and if so whether I can go ahead and implement the required logic in the `FileSystemStorage.writeFile(...)` method.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
