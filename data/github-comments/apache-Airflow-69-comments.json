I see and understand the problem now.\n\nIt feels to me like patching the `read` method isn't quite the right way to go. What we want is for the behavior of `get` to read defaults after `_cmd` configurations. What your patch does is remove all configuration variables that match a `_cmd` from the defaults. This creates the potential problem of using a `_cmd`, removing it, and then no longer having the default to fall back to.\n\nCould you, instead, create a second parser for defaults, perhaps `self.defaults = ConfigParser()` inside `__init__`, load `DEFAULT_CONFIG` into there, and modify `read` to check `self.defaults` after `_cmd` but before failing?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/258237030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/258266173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1834#issuecomment-258266173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1834","id":258266173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODI2NjE3Mw==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T20:36:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T20:36:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 I'll go ahead and squash on merge.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/258266173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/258333470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1854#issuecomment-258333470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1854","id":258333470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODMzMzQ3MA==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T02:59:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T02:59:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@felipetancredo Will #1806 work for you?
