Gist of our proposal:\r\n1) Avoid a complex segment leader election phase.\r\n2) Add ability to register multiple segment locations within the segment store. \r\n3) Use any one of these locations to download segments as and when needed.\r\n\r\nMore coming soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/462448559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/462451891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/3592#issuecomment-462451891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/3592","id":462451891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjQ1MTg5MQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-11T19:02:45Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T19:02:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@icefury71 thanks for clarification.

From [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance) there are several different algos, and comparing them it looks Welford's online algorithm and its related algo(parallel algo and high-order algo) is more practical. They are also algos adopted by spark at [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/CentralMomentAgg.scala#L189).

Stay tuned.\r\n\r\nYou are right that the wiki link you pointed to provides info on the high level operation aspects. Couple of aspects of Multitenancy that you might be interested in:\r\n 1. Managing the multi-tenant cluster: i.e., from the controller point of view. For more info on this you can review code in PinotTenantRestletResource.java and PinotHelixResourceManager.java as to how the mappings are managed etc. \r\n2. Serving multiple tables on servers: this deals with more of the runtime isolation aspects of Multi-tenancy. We currently have CPU isolation between tables - review code in PriorityScheduler.java\r\n\r\nHope this helps.

We apologize for the late response.\r\n\r\nThe re-factoring for offset not being a 'long' is hard and touches multiple places. The code on the server side (or that on the controller side) alone is probably easier than the idea of keeping it compatible between the two. We need to make sure that the segment completion works right with other types of offset. \r\n\r\nIf the offset is a Comparable, then I think it could be a little easier. We just have to try out the re-factor. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, as you say, the high-level interface can be targeted. Two major issues we found with High level streams: \r\n1. We are limited to consumption rate of one host.  This was a non-starter for some of our high ingestion use cases.\r\n2. Operationally it was a nightmare. One had to be careful about setting the Kafka instance config manually while expanding the cluster or replacing a node if it is down . We had gotten into situation where the Kafka traffic was split between a couple of hosts, leading to wrong results for the application. Addition of a new host to the cluster meant (sometimes) waiting for several days for that host to catch up, meanwhile making sure that new software is not deployed to that host. Some of these can be overcome with additional software, but we decided to go with LLC\r\n\r\nHope this helps.

We expect to finish it by the time we make the first apache release (which should be real soon, once we verify the current candidate in production). Meanwhile, a few comments:\r\n1. You seem to be running out of direct memory while loading a completed segment. Changing HEAP to MMAP will help there (assuming you Operating system over-commits mmap memory). Your time column unit is in MILLISECONDS. This can cause dictionary to explode unless you are rounding off the time values. Please check if you are doing so.  So, if your millisecond value is 1551113826143 then round it off to (for example) the nearest 5 minute value 1551113710000. You will need to do this before you send your Kafka events, if you have control over it. We are thinking of providing an automatic switch in pinot to do this (i.e. round off milliseonds to nearest 5 mins or 15 mins or hour, whatever)\r\n2. You may want to try using auto-segment siizing.

We expect to finish it by the time we make the first apache release (which should be real soon, once we verify the current candidate in production). Meanwhile, a few comments:\r\n> \r\n> 1. You seem to be running out of direct memory while loading a completed segment. Changing HEAP to MMAP will help there (assuming you Operating system over-commits mmap memory). Your time column unit is in MILLISECONDS. This can cause dictionary to explode unless you are rounding off the time values. Please check if you are doing so.  So, if your millisecond value is 1551113826143 then round it off to (for example) the nearest 5 minute value 1551113710000. You will need to do this before you send your Kafka events, if you have control over it. We are thinking of providing an automatic switch in pinot to do this (i.e. round off milliseonds to nearest 5 mins or 15 mins or hour, whatever)\r\n> 2. You may want to try using auto-segment siizing. See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PINOT/Consuming+and+Indexing+rows+in+Realtime\r\n\r\nyes, If I change to MMAP, there is no memory overflow.

It allows you to utilize memory more efficiently while getting good query performance.\r\n\r\nWe will be providing documentation with the next apache release on mmap vs heap, etc. Basic difference (as I have said so before) is that MMAP maps the segment file onto memory. So, it the pages are not resident, it will paged in the operating system. HEAP reads in the segment via Direct memory allocation.  So, we are never dependent on IO during query serving. The performance of these is dependent on your use case, hardware and operating system settings.
