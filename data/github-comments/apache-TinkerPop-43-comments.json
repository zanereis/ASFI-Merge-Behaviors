Second, I've started a thread on the dev mailing list to call attention to this (all web site changes go through community discussion over there) - you can see the thread here:\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6172f72fea030a0c46f983eda42321b7c4a958bed6038fe676990fc2@%3Cdev.tinkerpop.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nThird, could you please edit your README (and perhaps even the project description) to mention \"Apache TinkerPop™\".  \r\n\r\nFinally, do you have a more complex example of Gremlin in Elixer? I'd love to see more of the syntax - I looked at the tests, but I didn't see a nice sized query - preferably using the \"modern\" graph for context.  Even if it's not all working yet, could you demonstrate what this would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ng.V().has(\"name\",\"marko\").        \r\n  out(\"knows\").                     \r\n  out(\"knows\").\r\n  values(\"name\") \r\n```\r\n\r\nand maybe:\r\n\r\n```\r\n g.V().match(\r\n      as(\"a\").out(\"knows\").as(\"b\"),\r\n      as(\"a\").out(\"created\").as(\"c\"),\r\n      as(\"b\").out(\"created\").as(\"c\"),\r\n      as(\"c\").in(\"created\").count().is(2)).\r\n        select(\"c\").by(\"name\")\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/424158140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/424398086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/939#issuecomment-424398086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/939","id":424398086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDM5ODA4Ng==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-25T15:49:30Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T15:49:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/424398086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/424398581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/938#issuecomment-424398581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/938","id":424398581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDM5ODU4MQ==","user":{"login":"samhavens","id":7231205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMzEyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7231205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens","html_url":"https://github.com/samhavens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samhavens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-25T15:50:51Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T15:50:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@spmallette Thanks for the feedback.

A call to [Gremlex.Graph.g()](https://github.com/Revmaker/gremlex/blob/master/lib/gremlex/graph.ex#L30-L31) creates an [Erlang Queue](http://erlang.org/doc/man/queue.html). This basically starts the queue and from there we build queries using the rest of the functions. \r\n\r\nEach function accepts the queue as its first argument and updates the queue by appending a tuple where the first value in the tuple is the function name and the second is its arguments. We then return the queue back to the user to allow them to continue to build the query. In case you aren't familiar with Elixir, the pipe operator (`|>`) allows the nice syntax of being able to pass the output from one function to the next. This allowed us to easily build queries and unit test our [query builder](https://github.com/Revmaker/gremlex/blob/master/test/graph_test.exs#L16-L18).\r\n\r\nAn Erlang queue is represented by a tuple with two lists (front and back), so an empty queue would look like:\r\n\r\n```Elixir\r\niex(1)> Graph.g()\r\n{[], []}\r\n```\r\nCalling a function simply appends a tuple to the queue with its arguments:\r\n\r\n```\r\niex(2)> Graph.g() |> Graph.v()\r\n{[{\"V\", []}], []}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you've built your query, we pass the structure to our Client module which in turn compiles the data structure to a query using [Graph.encode/1](https://github.com/Revmaker/gremlex/blob/master/lib/gremlex/graph.ex#L335-L366). Once the query is compiled, we construct a [request](https://github.com/Revmaker/gremlex/blob/master/lib/gremlex/request.ex#L15) to make to the server.\r\n\r\nYou can see how we compile a query in our [tests](https://github.com/Revmaker/gremlex/blob/master/test/graph_test.exs#L393-L402). Here is a simple example:\r\n\r\n```Elixir\r\niex(4)> Graph.g() |> Graph.v() |> Graph.encode\r\n\"g.V()\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/424463889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/424468157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/938#issuecomment-424468157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/938","id":424468157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDQ2ODE1Nw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-25T19:18:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T19:18:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for the explanation. it looks like it's script based and not bytecode based. it would be cool to see bytecode support in the future. you might also consider implementing our test suite to ensure compliance with the Gremlin language. they are gherkin based tests and thus designed to be cross-language compatible: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/master/gremlin-test/features\r\n\r\nYou can read a bit about their structure here:\r\n\r\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.4.0-SNAPSHOT/dev/developer/#_gremlin_language_test_cases\r\n\r\nAnyway - very cool.

@mattallenuk - Judging from the comments it seems like the only thing missing here code-wise is an added test.

If your schedule doesn't allow for you to come back to this right now, perhaps I could assist in polishing up the final odds/ends for you?
