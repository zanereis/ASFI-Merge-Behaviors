stop the environment:\n\n`make destroy`\n\nThis command stops all docker images, removing them, deleting the temporary folders, and also removing dangling docker volumes.\n\nSo now we have support for

investigate the option of having only for Mac Dev Environment  the ability of using `docker port`\n\nThis way we have an easier way for people to setup their local dev environment, by avoiding the special network route tweak, and the ability to use docker for mac instead of docker-machine if they like\n\nI was planning to make it conditional, if Mac then, if not then use the current mode.\n\nBut then I was curious if using `docker port` we don't hit the performance problems of using `inspect` \n\nThat's why I'm debating if I should make condition in code with if Mac, or maybe control it thru wiskprops.\n\nBy doing with wiskprops property we can control which method to use from the outside, and we can run the benchmark side by side more easier.\n\nI think I would go in phases, solve one problem at a time and just solve it for Mac Dev, by detecting Mac.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/250479525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/250483130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1237#issuecomment-250483130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1237","id":250483130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDQ4MzEzMA==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T14:30:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T14:30:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG

The underlying reason is that in openwhisk there isn't yet a mechanism to create more than one namespace per subject but in other deployments that provide IAM, it is possible to have more than one subject per namespace. In this case, activations require a way to disambiguate the namespace to hold the activation record which is not possible with one subject key mapping to more than one namespace.\n\nAs a result, all activations are stored in one namespace. The CLI ignores the namespace so that one can see all their activations. Before we fix the CLI, we need to resolve other blocking issues under #1107.

internal network\n\nBut I think I found some tests that call run and init from docker host, when tests runs in addition of actionContainer tests.\nTake a look at

below yanked from #1359)\n\nAfter some experimentation, it became clear that the publish attribute for actions is not needed and, worse, can lead to confusion.\n\nFor example, create a package with --shared yes then create an action in that package also with --shared yes. Running wsk package get shows that the action has a publish value of false. However, running wsk action get on the actions shows the publish value set to true.\n\nAdditionally, running wsk action create --shared no to create an action inside a published package does not prevent others from invoking the action - that is, the publish value has no effect.\n\nLastly... creating an action outside of a shared package with --shared yes does not allow others to invoke that action.\n\ntl;dr The publish attribute for actions (and [other non-package entities](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/issues/465#issuecomment-220458240) as well) doesn't do anything, and should

For instance, a flag to build/test all binaries in such environments would be needed even though we want all of the cross-platform binaries to always to be built in the mentioned environments.
