regarding absence of position and limit in `Memory` (other fields are almost never used), If you try to always use them and so keep the source code simpler, what Druid currently does, it results into a lot of `ByteBuffer` object allocations via `slice()`, `asReadOnlyBuffer()`, etc. I see *millions* of `DirectByteBufferR` objects in heaps of our production Druid historical nodes.\r\n\r\n@cheddar @leerho do you have any specific plans to start migration from `ByteBuffer` to `Memory`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/274658045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/274689664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3863#issuecomment-274689664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3863","id":274689664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDY4OTY2NA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T03:13:13Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T03:13:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy,
