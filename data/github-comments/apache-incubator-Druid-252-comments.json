Start using the Oak-based index with more writer threads, to let it really shine (the microbenchmarks show that it becomes more attractive as the number of writers scales). This might require more far-fetched changes, which we might not fully appreciate at the moment, so let's discuss.\r\n\r\n@ebortnik thanks! Your comment makes things more clear. I have a follow-up question on the above comment though. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, our previous work has focused on distributed data ingestion in which multiple tasks can run at the same time to ingest data into the same dataSource. Each task uses a few threads for indexing (basically read thread, persist thread and merge thread), but they can run in parallel in multiple middleManagers (or even same middleManager) so that faster ingestion could be achieved. It seems that your comment assumes that multi-thread indexing will bring us other benefits which is missing in distributed data ingestion. What kind of benefits can we expect with multi-thread indexing? And how is it different from what we can get from distributed indexing?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/504597636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/504598899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5698#issuecomment-504598899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5698","id":504598899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDU5ODg5OQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T23:02:14Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T23:02:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sanastas thanks! This proposal looks only focused on support of OakIncrementalIndex which looks good to me. I have a question on the benchmark results you posted though. Do you know what caused the performance degradation when the number of rows was increased? 60% degradation sounds pretty huge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/504598899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/504616419","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7928#issuecomment-504616419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7928","id":504616419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDYxNjQxOQ==","user":{"login":"xqwbx163","id":20455410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDU1NDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20455410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163","html_url":"https://github.com/xqwbx163","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xqwbx163/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-22T01:40:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-22T01:40:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thanks

Thanks for sharpening the focus. With a faster concurrent incremental index, we could introduce more reader threads (I guess those are the threads that actually build the index ..) In other words, this will improve vertical scalability. This is complementary to horizontal scalability (distributed indexing). All in all, we expect running fewer tasks, merging less, and completing the overall indexing work faster. Does this make sense?

thanks for taking a look!\r\n\r\nFirst, indeed this proposal is about supporting OakIncrementalIndex. This is the idea we pursue for a while already. In general it is about building a bigger off-heap IncrementalIndexes and enjoying a good performance :) Would you like to work with us on promoting this possibility? Just as consultant, your insights are very valuable....\r\n\r\nSecond, Oak have couple of advantages when working with big data. As @ebortnik has mentioned, working with off-heap serialized data make it less affected to the JVM GC. In addition, Oak utilizes cache locality for searches. Lastly, Oak works good under multi-threading contention and scales well with multiple threads. However, in this specific experiment (single thread) the main problem should be caused by GC.\r\n\r\nOriginal, Druid's IncrementalIndex allocates the (to-be-added) rows on-heap prior to the benchmarks (taking 4GB out of given 12GB). Then StringIndexer takes more memory to save the String<->Integer translation, let's exaggerate and give it another 4GB. From here, for all other on-heap objects we remain with 4GB, which puts a lot of stress on GC. The ConcurrentSkipListMap used in Druid's IncrementalIndex is know to be less GC-friendly due to many small objects it allocates. I believe this is the reason for huge performance degradation we see.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is a [reference](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19159-01/819-3681/6n5srlhqf/index.html) to Oracle themselves mentioning about Java Garbage Collector: \r\n> Garbage collection (GC) reclaims the heap space previously allocated to objects no longer needed. The process of locating and removing the dead objects can stall any application and consume as much as 25 percent throughput.\r\n\r\nAnd [here](http://gridgain.blogspot.com/2014/06/jdk-g1-garbage-collector-pauses-for.html) one can take a look on experimenting with GC and big heap sizes. The conclusion is:\r\n> From conducting numerous tests, we have concluded that unless you are utilizing some off-heap technology, no Garbage Collector provided with JDK will render any kind of stable GC performance with heap sizes larger that 16GB. For example, on 50GB heaps we can often encounter up to 5 minute GC pauses, with average pauses of 2 to 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nWould be really glad to hear your thoughts!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/504917683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/504933517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7838#issuecomment-504933517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7838","id":504933517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDkzMzUxNw==","user":{"login":"sanastas","id":12136181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM2MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12136181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas","html_url":"https://github.com/sanastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-24T09:29:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T09:29:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jihoonson , in addition to multi-threading indexing (writes), we can benefit from faster read-write mixture.
