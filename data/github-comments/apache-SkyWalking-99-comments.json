this is a complex problem.\r\n1.the controller method modifier is `private` which is not recommend for controller, without skywalking agent it is working just because an accident, you can try add a `public` method in the controller ,you will see the `goodsExternalService ` is always `null` in private method.\r\n1.1 why the `goodsExternalService ` is always `null` in private method if add another `public` method?\r\n  the reason is the controller is enhanced by cglib in spring ,in enhanced classes ,private method cannot get `goodsExternalService`\r\n1.2 why it can work in current version?\r\n the reason is the controller just have a method and is `private` and it is not match the `ascpect expression `,so the controller will not be enhanced by cglib in spring .\r\n\r\n2.why with skywalking agent it doesn't work?\r\nthe reason is is have implement an interface `EnhanceInstance` and it have two default method `getSkywalkingField` and `setSkywalkingField` which modifier is `public` ,this
