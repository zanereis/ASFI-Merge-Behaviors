We should change it to use the new parameter, but we should still accept the config values of the old parameter.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/84059897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/84060511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/484#issuecomment-84060511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/484","id":84060511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MDYwNTEx","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-20T16:23:34Z","updated_at":"2015-03-20T16:23:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, LGTM.
