Thanks a lot for reviewing my PR! You ask right questions. I worked on this PR pretty much time and then need to restore why I did some things this way. So I'm going to answer for one thing at a time.\r\n\r\n> dropping supporting of fixed-size and case insensitive strings\r\n\r\nThose 2 types actually aren't used in Ignite. \r\n1. There is a ticket for supporting case insensitive things [IGNITE-3999](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-3999). Also some comments in this ticket suggest to implement it in different way, with introducing functional indexes.\r\n2. For fixed size strings. We work with them incorrectly and it looks like a bug. H2 provide a mapping: ValueStringFixed is used for char(), nchar(), character() types. But Ignite maps char() to String.class, then with H2Utils maps String.class to varchar, see [H2Utils.dbTypeFromClass](https://github.com/apache/ignite/blob/86073947248f0ca878e754e8b1b6181fdac72bd0/modules/indexing/src/main/java/org/apache/ignite/internal/processors/query/h2/H2Utils.java#L709)\r\n\r\nI didn't have a problem to implement them, there will be just 2 classes that extends StringInlineIndexKeyType. But we can't test them now, as they will be not in use. Also it breaks compatibility for fixed strings (as currently it used type ValueString type 13, instead of 21 for ValueStringFixed).\r\n\r\n> closes doors for future improvement like [this one](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-13364).\r\n\r\nFor task IGNITE-13364, I check a PR [PR/8161](https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/8161/files) for this task and found that there is no problems to implement this feature within current changes. Actually there is `precision` field (GridH2RowDescriptor -> GridQueryProperty), that can be declared within IndexKeyDefinition, and used for computing inline size instead of parsing sql query.\r\n\r\nSo, why do you think it will close door for new improvements?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/775201344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/775505926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/8756#issuecomment-775505926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/8756","id":775505926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTUwNTkyNg==","user":{"login":"Nikita-tech-writer","id":73828260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODI4MjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73828260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer","html_url":"https://github.com/Nikita-tech-writer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nikita-tech-writer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-08T22:28:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T22:28:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Mmuzaf,
