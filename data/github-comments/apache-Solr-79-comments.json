Arbitrary props were added later, and kindof by accident.\r\n\r\nSOLR-13271 added the \"readOnly\" property, and the first draft of that functionality added \"readOnly\" using the syntax that we now call arbitrary/user-provided.  The patch later pivoted to handling \"readOnly\" as a first-class property, similarly to replicationFactor, collection.configName, etc, but the plumbing for \"user-provided\" props was never removed.\r\n\r\nCollection properties (added by SOLR-11960) had existed for around a year at this time, but they weren't used very widely, and never came up in the SOLR-13271 discussion.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, I suspect the duplication was accidental oversight and not an intentional choice.  Going to ping SOLR-13271 to confirm this, and if so maybe we could deprecate the arbitrary-props in modify-collection in favor of COLLECTIONPROPs.

Use the `/_introspect` endpoints to drive it\r\n2. Do some code analysis (e.g. use reflection) to drive it\r\n3. Generate tests (or stubs) from the OpenAPI spec - I see OAG is already here https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/6d838cb3de9774e1a17208a78210f8968ce4e959/solr/solrj/build.gradle#L131\r\n\r\nI think the problem with 1 and 2 is that something dynamic like that is probably quite hard to unpick if something does go wrong, e.g. if it misses a set of endpoints will it be obvious? Plus if any endpoints have precondition (collection existing) then it would still need extra context to drive it.\r\n\r\nThe problem with 3 is how you manage the generated source and whether you're able to generate something that's ready to use, or if it's just generating stubs that require manual intervention to turn into usable tests. If it's the former then it's great, because changes to the spec can automatically generate updated tests. With the latter it can be a good starting point for writing tests normally.\r\n\r\nATM that is what I think I will do - use the spec to generate an initial set of test stubs so that I cover all the existing endpoints, but I'm not planning on putting the generator into the PR (unless it is in state of producing ready to use output anyway).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2592917253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2592944289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2930#issuecomment-2592944289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2930","id":2592944289,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ajTCh","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-15T14:05:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T14:05:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Let's just do PATCH to /api/collections/myCollName to update anything updatable.\r\n\r\nWe discussed PATCH a bit [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2930#discussion_r1915243956), and the slightly preferred option seemed to be to utilize PATCH only if we can find other APIs where it makes sense as well.

In other words: if you're cramming them into a POJO at deserialization time, `{\"foo\": null}` and `{}` are indistinguishable on the server side.\r\n\r\nThat said, I guess we don't strictly need a POJO.  I _think_ we'd be able to distinguish these cases if we had Jackson deserialize into a Map instead.  It'd make our OAS and codegen artifacts less specific (and therefore less useful) for this API, but maybe we're OK with that if it means avoiding the need for a `DELETE /api/collections/collName/metadata/replicationFactor`.\r\n\r\nIf folks are OK dropping the request-body POJO, I can investigate going this route?\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2592944289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2593359376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/3029#issuecomment-2593359376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/3029","id":2593359376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ak4YQ","user":{"login":"laminelam","id":104593675,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjv5Cw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104593675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam","html_url":"https://github.com/laminelam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laminelam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-15T16:16:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T17:40:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@epugh \r\n\r\nActually, this is not a new type of authentication.

It's only safe if we're certain that it's exactly a file system path.  Paths resolved inside a DirectoryFactory/Directory are not necessarily literally on the file system (it's an abstraction to data that could be in HDFS or S3 or...).  It'd be nice to use a Path for this anyway but shouldn't be without a custom FileSystem impl (very out of scope here).  Same for ZK paths.  Also some of our HTTP APIs are file-system inspired (ConfigSet, FileStore, ...) with paths in which '/' is the separator no matter what the underlying file system is Solr is running on (after all; don't want the client to care about the OS Solr is running on).  These are not *directly* convertible to a Path either, or at least take some work to do separator translation if the end location is on-disk (file store & file system ConfigSetService).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2596877815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2596891316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/3036#issuecomment-2596891316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/3036","id":2596891316,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6ayWq0","user":{"login":"psalagnac","id":82967811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY3ODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82967811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac","html_url":"https://github.com/psalagnac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalagnac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T21:08:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T21:08:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> ZkStateReader.waitForState has the wait unit params immediately after the collection name.

that.\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2603163228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2603171608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/3048#issuecomment-2603171608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/3048","id":2603171608,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6bKT8Y","user":{"login":"renatoh","id":10344132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQ0MTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10344132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh","html_url":"https://github.com/renatoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renatoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-20T20:13:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T20:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

However, something does not seem to work as expected as Solr is not able to initialize the core, neither with tlogs copied to the new location, nor with an empty location.\r\n\r\nThe error encountered is given in the log dump below.\r\n\r\nI had previously configured the ulog location like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<updateLog>\r\n    <str name=\"dir\">${solr.ulog.dir:/solr/logs/author_search}</str>\r\n    <int name=\"numVersionBuckets\">${solr.ulog.numVersionBuckets:65536}</int>\r\n</updateLog>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen Solr is starting, it seems to recognize the configuration but aborts with a message about missing file permissions. The location `/solr/logs/author_search` exists, belongs to user `solr:solr` and has permissions `0750` (I have even tried with 0777).\r\n\r\n**Question: what is the target folder structure Solr creates under `/solr/logs/author_search` and what could cause the error I am encountering?**\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is I am doing something wrong in regards to the folder structure.\r\n\r\nI would like to carry over the old tlogs from 9.5.0 to have a seemless transition but I am stuck with this problem for now.\r\n\r\n**I can provide more logs or help debugging upon request.**\r\n\r\n### Solr version etc. from log\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nhead -n 20 /var/log/solr/solr.log.1\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.519 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.e.j.s.Server jetty-10.0.22; built: 2024-06-27T16:03:51.502Z; git: 5c8471e852d377fd726ad9b1692c35ffc5febb09; jvm 21.0.4+8-LTS-274\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.748 WARN  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.e.j.u.DeprecationWarning Using @Deprecated Class org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.listener.ELContextCleaner\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.770 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.a.s.s.CoreContainerProvider Using logger factory org.apache.logging.slf4j.Log4jLoggerFactory\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.775 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.a.s.s.CoreContainerProvider  ___      _       Welcome to Apache Solr‚Ñ¢ version 9.8.0\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.775 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.a.s.s.CoreContainerProvider / __| ___| |_ _   Starting in cloud mode on port 8983\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.775 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.a.s.s.CoreContainerProvider \\__ \\/ _ \\ | '_|  Install dir: /opt/solr-9.8.0\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.776 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.a.s.s.CoreContainerProvider |___/\\___/_|_|    Start time: 2025-01-23T11:31:29.776093489Z\r\n2025-01-23 12:31:29.778 INFO  (main) [c: s: r: x: t:] o.a.s.s.CoreContainerProvider Solr started with \"-XX:+CrashOnOutOfMemoryError\" that will crash on any OutOfMemoryError exception.
