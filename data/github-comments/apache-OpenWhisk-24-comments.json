to the discussion but since I am about to redo the action impl, we are now where we need to settle on the semantic extension.  My thoughts on the existing stuff:\n1. **Global as default or only mechanism**.  Unsafe as parameters could be keys\n2. **Parameters only to the first action**. Safer because it will empirically become clear that's where params are going but unnaturally specific that one can only say A1[P] o A2 o A3  \n3. **Bind parameters explicitly**.  I like this one because it lets you says A1[P1] o A2[P2] o ....\n\n@rabbah and I had a discussion and came up with this proposal.\n1. At the REST level, the parameter stuff would be encoded thus:\n   `[ {\"name\" : \"A1\", \"params\" : { paramMap1 }}, {\"name\" : \"A2\", \"params\" : { paramMap2 }}, .... ]`\n2. At the CLI, one would write\n    `wsk action create sequence S —action A1 P11 V11 P12 V12 —action A2 P21 V21 P22 V23`\n\nFeatures:\n1. It is similar in strength to @psuter's proposal but is robust in case an action is repeated in a sequence.  In that case,the action names when expressed in the sequence would appear twice.  Since we do not further bind that action, we must somehow differentiate things.  One approach, as taken here, is to use positional parameters.\n2. The REST API is the true interface and lets you specify any binding of parameters because you can repeat not at all or everywhere or anything in between.\n3. The CLI interface above makes the binding clear and allows us to support global binding by adding `--global PG1 VG2 PG2 VG2`.  We can extend this with an arbitrary subset if desired since the REST API uses an exploded view.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229976950/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/229978587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/116#issuecomment-229978587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/116","id":229978587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTk3ODU4Nw==","user":{"login":"psuter","id":245547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter","html_url":"https://github.com/psuter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T15:37:07Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T15:37:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In the above, I assume `paramMapN` are, well, maps where the key is the name of the parameter passed to the sequence, and the value the name of the parameter when passed to the action?

However.... Were there plans to persist information related to the rule such as user asking how many times this was fired?  If so, deletion would erase that information and would not be the same as activation.\n3. **Don't name the rule**  Viewing this as a (directed) graph, it seems redundant to name the edge.  I can see two reasons for naming.  First is that you might eventually want multiple edges connecting the same trigger/action because there are different types of rules such as ones that throttle or perform filtering etc. (ie multigraph).  Second as convenience if you find yourself having to talk about that edge.  Currently, we use that for activability so the case here partly hinges on issue 2 and also on the possibility of future issues related to auditing and filtering.  If the rule becomes unnamed, it doesn't change its role as an entity nor the obligation for permission checking and one would still need the ability to list rules.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230495160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230501003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/576#issuecomment-230501003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/576","id":230501003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDUwMTAwMw==","user":{"login":"nwspeete-ibm","id":18600107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjAwMTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18600107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm","html_url":"https://github.com/nwspeete-ibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwspeete-ibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T14:50:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T14:50:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The steps are documented in the push package and open on how to install.

The Rule is what allows this -- without the Rule, we throw away the concept of \"event bus\", and many good features of event-based programming.\nSuggested Reading:[ Distributed Event-Based Systems](http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30736519/Gero_Mhl_Distributed_EventBased_Systems_26734.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&Expires=1467738002&Signature=lytEpkIkBcERPSOFzB%2FLmP0MvrA%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DDistributed_event-based_systems.pdf) (Muhl et al. 2006)\n\n2) A fundamental principle of programming language design: if it's worth having a concept in the programming language, it's worth having a first-class object for the concept.    I can/will come up lots of examples where having first-class Rules makes OpenWhisk programming easier.\n\nSorry for the relative brevity --  if this debate lives for a while, I'll come back with examples to justify these principles concretely.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230520609/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230539783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/712#issuecomment-230539783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/712","id":230539783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDUzOTc4Mw==","user":{"login":"sjfink","id":1533170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink","html_url":"https://github.com/sjfink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T17:06:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T17:06:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

can you please list concrete real-world mass-market use cases which we consider to be in scope for what we're trying to do with whisk? often, it's trade-off between simplicity and richness in the of concepts, and we need to consider both sides.\n\neg -- as markus stated, having to name a rule is at the moment introducing complexity that wouldn't be needed in most (maybe all) of today's use cases. in fact, the system would be more usable for the large majority of the use cases if we didn't have to assign a name, for instance. so in the context of thinking through concepts, we need to strongly factor in whether we're using a specific concept at the cost of complicating a mass market /simple use case, which is not viable. a simple use case always has to be as simple to be as simple to execute on as if a more complex concept didn't exist -- i.e. additional complexity must be optional. if that is not possible, we have to be open to sacrificing the more complex use case.\n\ni'm not saying we have to keep or get rid of rules, but we can't just be asking to keep it without those considerations being addressed. however, i'm for removing rules if we can't identity strong enough use cases -- which i haven't seen so far.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230548114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230556105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/849#issuecomment-230556105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/849","id":230556105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDU1NjEwNQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T18:07:05Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T18:07:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let's

is a frustrating bug....\n1. The problem doesn't occur every time but seems to happen most of the time. (> 75%)  Having to re-deploy the system repeatedly makes this a time-consuming experiment.\n2. Upgrading to kafka 0.10 (both kafka and client libs) apparently did not affect this bug.\n3. While this problem was happening (in those runs), I was able to run a producer/consumer pair (https://github.com/mapr-demos/kafka-sample-programs.git) on another topic during the 5 minute period without any bad behavior.  This suggests there is nothing wrong with the kafka and zk containers but that the fault lies with the client libraries.\n4. Checking consumer offsets did not reveal anything because this is consumer-centric data.\n5. Long weekend follows....\n6. The bug appears to have **disappeared** and just now it worked 5 times in a row.  Review of  the invoker and controller code shows no reason why invoker->controller would act any differently than the controller->invoker.\n7. The kafka and zk containers are started without mapping to the host so there should be no state passing between subsequent container runs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230568237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230569176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/833#issuecomment-230569176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/833","id":230569176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDU2OTE3Ng==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T18:54:21Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T18:54:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No free lunch.
