The JobManager would check the version and respond with a failure, if it does not match. You can probably make the JobManager part very simple, no need to add extra constructor parameters, etc.\n\nThat way, the change would be minimally invasive, and we could see how well it addresses the issues, and whether we should extend this to other messages as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/125886476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/125887226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/938#issuecomment-125887226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/938","id":125887226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTg4NzIyNg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-29T09:08:25Z","updated_at":"2015-07-29T09:08:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It failed when at the end of the program, queued channel data was present at the end of the job.

As far as I can see, we handle all the serialization ourselves now. We only used the Dill library to serialize the user-defined function alongside with the operator. Now, the operator is extracted from the plan which has been distributed in the Python files to the nodes beforehand. The plan is only send once to generate the Java execution plan. The old behavior was to serialize the operator, pass it to Java, and sent it back again during execution. Performance-wise the new implementation could even be a bit faster.\n\n+1 for explicitly passing the file paths. Java and Python have different ways to determine temporary file paths and this has been a problem in the passed on some platforms.\n\nYour changes are sensible and this looks good to

Please have a look and let me know what you think.\n\nFor the merging of the the different types of snapshots and handling them uniformly I do not have any current solution. If you have any, I am open, of course, to discuss it, because I agree that this would be nice.\n\nFor the comment on the getAccumulatorResultsStringified():\n1) this is to be presented by the web interface to the user, just for monitoring purposes\n2) this is called at the jobManager.\n\nThe problem is that the jobManager has only the blobKeys that point to the stored accumulators. The serialized data reside in the blobCache and have to be fetched in order to be inspected.\n\nCurrently the jobManager just forwards the blobKeys to the client, which fetches the blobs and does the deserialization and the final merging. This is done for jobManager scalability reasons, as given that we are talking about accumulators of arbitrary size, loading them from disk and deserializing them would be time and resource consuming. The same holds in the case that we wanted to get the type of these large accumulators (it is needed by the method). We would have to load and deserialize them at the jobManager. The currently implemented solution is just the result of this design decision.
