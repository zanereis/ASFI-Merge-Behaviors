\r\nI think this makes us a more unified code style and gain a better performance.\r\nI did a little google search and got some betters answers than mine.\r\n\r\n1. [\"entrySet()\" should be iterated when both the key and value are needed\r\n](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/tag/performance/RSPEC-2864)\r\n> When only the keys from a map are needed in a loop, iterating the keySet makes sense. But when both the key and the value are needed, it's more efficient to iterate the entrySet, which will give access to both the key and value, instead.\r\n\r\n2. [Performance Comparison of Different Ways to Iterate over HashMap](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/hashmap/performance-comparison-of-different-ways-to-iterate-over-hashmap/)\r\n>Using entrySet() in for-each loop : 50\r\nUsing keySet() in for-each loop : 76\r\nUsing entrySet() and iterator : 50\r\nUsing keySet() and iterator : 75\r\n\r\n3. [performance-considerations-for-keyset-and-entryset-of-map](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3870064/performance-considerations-for-keyset-and-entryset-of-map)\r\n>Here you first need to get hold of the set of keys. This takes time proportional to the capacity of the map (as opposed to size for the LinkedHashMap). After this is done, you call get() once for each key. Sure, in the average case, with a good hashCode-implementation this takes constant time. However, it will inevitably require lots of .hashCode and .equals calls, which will obviously take more time than just doing a entry.value() call.\r\n\r\nAt last, I have not done such a profiling. So I think it's more about unifying code style here.\r\nThis is a trivial change, it's on your call. 😃 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/446158503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/446190487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/2926#issuecomment-446190487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2926","id":446190487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjE5MDQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"luchy0120","id":5823533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjM1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5823533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120","html_url":"https://github.com/luchy0120","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luchy0120/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-11T12:47:25Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T12:47:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi , @kimmking , I'm trying to join the email , but failed .

Collection<Class> getSerializableClasses() {\r\n    return Arrays.asList(User.class, Page.class, UserService.class);\r\n}\r\n\r\n*```*\r\n*整个调用出现问题的原理可以看下图。*\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4089452/49933990-2297e000-ff08-11e8-8861-fd5931d1fc5a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n所以解决办法有两种：\r\n1.不要启用这个优化，也就是不要设置optimizer。\r\n2.dubbo代码进行了初步的优化，进行了初步的测试，可以运行。原理如图：\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4089452/49934014-33e0ec80-ff08-11e8-9f04-a9f8104946ce.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n原来的接口里有一个全局的映射表，这个逻辑不改变的前提下；针对部分接口维度的优化，可以新建一个id和class列表。这样可以实现功能，但是同时带来了新建和维护这个列表的成本。\r\n\r\nvictory

I didn't notice your comment.\r\nNow, we can config like this:\r\n```\r\n<dubbo:reference id=\"demoService\" check=\"false\" interface=\"org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService\">\r\n        <dubbo:method name=\"sayHello\" connections=\"10\"/>\r\n    </dubbo:reference>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in my debug, the connections config will not effect.\r\nIn my opinion, this setting is meaningless. Because the meaning of connections is to set the number of tcp channels, and for dubbo, an invoker corresponds to a service. We can only control the number of tcp links managed by an invoker, not the method.\r\n\r\nAt present, we also need to solicit opinions from many people. If we can agree, I think we need to modify the xbd file of dubbo, and the connections are not allowed on the method
