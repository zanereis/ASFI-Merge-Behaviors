Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action?

Now, proportion is used to decide how many sample buckets we will have, bucketSize = (int) (1 / proportion);, so if proportion is 0.5, we will get a bucket whose size is 2, which means we will sample one point for each two data points. if proportion is larger than 0.5, like 0.8, the bucket size is always 1, which means we will sample one point for each one data point(yes, that's doing nothing). However, if proportion is 0.1, the bucket size is 10, which means we will sample one point for each 10 data points.\r\n\r\nIt's not a bug, proportion is just defined like that in EqualSizeBucketSample method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1865721786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1865915164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/11762#issuecomment-1865915164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/11762","id":1865915164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5vN5sc","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-21T09:15:19Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T09:15:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [![Quality Gate Passed](https://sonarsource.github.io/sonarcloud-github-static-resources/v2/checks/QualityGateBadge/qg-passed-20px.png 'Quality Gate Passed')](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=apache_iotdb&pullRequest=11762) **Quality Gate passed**  \nKudos, no new issues were introduced!\n\n[0 New issues](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=apache_iotdb&pullRequest=11762&resolved=false&inNewCodePeriod=true)  \n[0 Security Hotspots](https://sonarcloud.io/project/security_hotspots?id=apache_iotdb&pullRequest=11762&resolved=false&inNewCodePeriod=true)  \n[0.0% Coverage on New Code](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=apache_iotdb&pullRequest=11762&metric=new_coverage&view=list)  \n[0.0% Duplication on New Code](https://sonarcloud.io/component_measures?id=apache_iotdb&pullRequest=11762&metric=new_duplicated_lines_density&view=list)  \n  \n[See analysis details on SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=apache_iotdb&pullRequest=11762)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1865915164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":12526,"client_id":"Iv1.dc610988574d1724","slug":"sonarqubecloud","node_id":"MDM6QXBwMTI1MjY=","owner":{"login":"SonarSource","id":545988,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0NTk4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource","html_url":"https://github.com/SonarSource","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SonarSource/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"name":"SonarQubeCloud","description":"\r\nSonarQube Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected.

values(1,1)\r\n```\r\nrun delete on another cli:\r\n```java\r\ndelete timeseries  root.db.d1.s1\r\n```\r\nWithout this patch, Insert operation will insert data into `root.db.d1.s1` that has been deleted in another cli.\r\nWhile with this patch, delete operation will wait insert operation finish so it can delete timeseries safely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1867336540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1867455971","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/11775#issuecomment-1867455971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/11775","id":1867455971,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM5vTx3j","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-22T09:33:10Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T09:33:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more.

The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more.
