Hi,\r\n> \r\n> the example given states you end up with two different record keys, since delivery is a part of the key. In this case abcd.delivery and abcd.payment make for the record key: 'hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field': 'abcd.delivery,abcd.payment' so 1st recordkey is 2000,upi 2nd recordkey is 3000,upi\r\n> \r\n> Record key works like a PK on a table (unique, non-nullable field). In your case, you end up with two records with different record key and that's expected. Precombine and upserts are supposed to maintain the uniqueness of recordKey.\r\n> \r\n> assume you use only delivery field as record key to make it easier so if you have record with delivery:3000 hudi will do insert (if record with same record key does not exists in the table), if record with delivery:2000 and it already exists in the table then update\r\n> \r\n> precombine works before write, incoming batch of data is deduplicated based on record key and precombine field so if in incoming batch you have two records with the same record key, then one with greater precombine field value will be passed to write operation\r\n\r\n@kazdy iam sorry i feel my description not clear, let me rephrase it the scenario is when at two different times same record is being pushed to hudi table then i find two records in the table instead of one. By same record i mean same record keys ie.. `delivery : 2000` in the record1 and again `delivery : 2000` in the record2 and both these records are sent in two different files at different timings. \r\n```bash\r\nrecordKey : `delivery` # just one attribute\r\nGlue job 1 reading file1 has delivery:`2000` \r\nGlue job 2 reading file2 also has delivery:`2000`  # this should lead to upsert as we have same record key, but the observation is otherwise\r\n```\r\nPost running both glue jobs there should ideally be only one record (the updated one) in the table but we find two records. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1273179895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1273197878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5893#issuecomment-1273197878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5893","id":1273197878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5L43U2","user":{"login":"BalaMahesh","id":25053668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDUzNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25053668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh","html_url":"https://github.com/BalaMahesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-10T11:49:58Z","updated_at":"2022-10-10T11:49:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@nsivabalan / @rmahindra123  - sorry for the long delay.

And we are using spark `hive metastore` to read the data. **Note** The metadata is disabled (by default as in documentation) and hence no `table/.hoodie/metadata` folder exists. Reading using metastore works fine.\r\n\r\nNow, We upgraded to hudi `0.12.0`, and tried to read the data using `metastore` - \r\nThe data reading has become quite slow, atleast 10x. And we get a continuous warning (see screenshot) where it tries to refresh the table after few seconds, and throws warnings that it cannot find the metadata folder. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12491651/194896794-905df8c3-92f1-4a19-8053-3ea558e585dd.png)\r\n\r\nAs i see from the comments of @yihua , the reader by default does/should not use metadata - then why do we get these unlimited continuous refreshes and warnings\r\n\r\nIs this confiugraiton `DEFAULT_METADATA_ENABLE_FOR_READERS` only used for spark DataSourceOptions?
