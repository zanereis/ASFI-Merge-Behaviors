They have a few attributes: \n- `key` (optional)\n- `source_task`, `source_dag` (required) \n- `target_task` and `target_dag` (optional)\n- `execution_date` (required, usually set automatically)\n- `timestamp` (required, set automatically)\n\n##### Setting\n\nWhen an `XCom` is set, its values are set appropriately (with sensible defaults). For example, this is sufficient to store a value:\n\n``` python\nti = context['ti']\nti.xcom_set(value=1)\n```\n\nHowever it is also possible to overwrite values, which is good to make XComs easy for downstream tasks to find. This shows all possible values (normally you shouldn't need to do this):\n\n``` python\nti.xcom_set(\n    key='key', # assign a key\n    value=1,  # assign a value\n    target_task=some_task, # assign a target task\n    target_dag=some_dag, # assign a target dag\n    execution_date=some_future_date) # assign an execution date\n```\n\nIt's important to remember that settings things like targets doesn't _automatically_ send the information to the target; it still has to be retrieved. Users should set these parameters because they make it much easier for the target to query for results.\n\n##### Getting\n\n`XCom`s can be retrieved by matching any of their attributes. If multiple matches are found, the most recently-stored value is returned. In general, `XCom`s are retrieved by matching a key, a source task, or a target task. When `TaskInstances` try to retrieve `XCom`s, they look for ones that target themselves first.\n\nSo this is sufficient to see if any messages were \"left\" for a task:\n\n``` python\nval = ti.xcom_get()\n```\n\nOr we could do this maximally complicated example:\n\n``` python\nval = ti.xcom_get(\n    key='key', # match this key\n    source_task='task_id', # the source task must be 'task_id' (could have passed a TaskInstance)\n    source_dag='dag_id', # the source dag must be 'dag_id' (could have passed a DAG)\n    target_task='task_id', # the target task must be 'task_id'\n    target_dag='dag_id', # the target dag must be 'dag_id'\n    execution_date=some_date, # get results from a certain execution_date\n    limit=5, #get 5 results instead of 1\n    include_prior_dates=True) # include results that match but with earlier execution_dates\n```\n\nThe only important thing is that since `ti.xcom_get()` targets `ti` by default, users should pass `target_task=None` if they want to turn that behavior off.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot of material here. \n1. Renamed to XCom\n2. Added concepts of `target_task`/`target_dag`\n3. Any `Operator` that returns a value from its `execute()` method will automatically set an XCom value with key `airflow.models.RETURNED_VALUE`. The key would only be required if the `Operator` set multiple XComs; if it only has the returned one, then it can be retrieved without dealing with keys (since it will be the most recent XCom from that source).\n4. Multiple XCom results can be retrieved at once (if, for example, your Task was waiting for three XComs from 3 upstream tasks). If there are multiple results, they arrive in a `{XCom: XCom.value}` dictionary so they can be identified.

I've been playing with this and I think I made it _too_ flexible. There's too much going on. So I'm trying to refine it. Here's a sketch of a restricted version, please let me know what you think. This focuses more on your direct \"push\"/\"pull\" idea and less on being able to send/retrieve arbitrary XComs. I think this sketch is a lot cleaner. \n\nAlso I was considering `xcom_push`/`xcom_pull` instead of `xcom_set` and `xcom_get`.\n\n##### Pushing\n\nTask instances can _push_ an XCom to a specific task, or leave it to be _pulled_ later. Full signature:\n\n``` python\ndef ti.xcom_push(\n    key,\n    value,\n    to_tasks=None # can be a list. \n    to_dags='__SELF_DAG__', # Defaults to the TI's DAG. Can be a DAG, list, or None.\n    visible_on=None # defaults to execution_date. \n    )\n\n```\n\n`visible_on` lets messages be forward-dated (for example, if a task wants a simple way to report something to itself when it runs the following day)\n\n##### Pulling\n\nTask Instances can receive XComs of which they are the target, or they can pull from a specific source. No more general listening -- if you don't specify a source and you aren't the target, you won't receive anything.\n\nBy default, the result of `xcom_pull()` is a Dataframe of XComs (default limit of 100).\n\n``` python\ndef ti.xcom_pull(\n    key=None, # filters if provided\n    from_tasks=None, # can be a list.\n    from_dags='__SELF_DAG__', # defaults to ti's DAG. can be a list.\n    limit=100, # maximum number of results to return\n    include_prior_dates=False, # if True includes XComs sent prior to the execution_date\n    return_first_value=False\n    ):\n        ...\n        if return_first_value:\n            return result.iloc[0].val # XCom value\n        else:\n            return result #DataFrame\n```\n\nAll args are optional and the defaults are reasonable; calling `ti.xcom_pull()` will return (up to) the latest 100 XComs sent to `ti` today.\n\nIf `from_tasks` and `from_dags` are not provided, the TI will only receive XComs if it is the target (meaning they were directly \"pushed\" to it). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/130148647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/130149742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/248#issuecomment-130149742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/248","id":130149742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDE0OTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-12T03:40:37Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T03:40:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Airflow wasn't really designed for \"conditional pathing\" originally, but there are ways to do this now.

It's also tricky because most people won't be able to test many operators because you may not have some of the systems in your infrastructure. For instance I can't test Microsoft SQL Server of Postgres related hooks and operators because I don't have any of those laying around.\n\nI'll try to generalize the tests and document the setup process as much as possible. In the meantime, you can run the first few lines of `rununittests.sh` to point to a unit tests environment, run `airflow initdb` and `airflow webserver` to get in the UI and provide that connection information for the systems you support (mysql_default, presto_default, hdfs_default, ). \n\nNote that some tests may (at the moment) require data structures that you don't have, notably a \"babynames\" dataset. One of the tests should probably one that populates said dataset...\n\nMaybe we can work together at making running tests outside of Airbnb as easy as possible.\n\nI also run the tests before I merge any significant PRs to master, and thoroughly before pushing a new release to Pypi.

That seems to work for passing most things.  However, I'm still running into a problem. Basically, what I'm trying to do is set one of the variables to the execution date which is currently the default macro\n\n```\n{{ ds }}\n```\n\nHowever, I need the timestamp in a different format so I really want to use something like \n\n```\n{{ execution_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') }}\n```\n\nWhen I do this outside of the DAG declaration it works fine returning me the string in the format I want.  However, if I attempt to access the macro in the `user_defined_macros` section, it instead returns the following string \n\n```\n\"{{ execution_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') }}\"\n```\n\nIn other words, this works:\n\n```\nprocTm = '''{{ execution_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') }}'''\n```\n\nBut this does not:\n\n```\ndag = DAG('extractData',\n    default_args=default_args,\n    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),\n    start_date=datetime(2016, 6, 3, 00, 49),\n    end_date=datetime(2020, 8, 31, 23),\n    user_defined_macros={\n        'procDt': '''{{ execution_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') }}''',\n    },\n    )\n```\n\nI assume that this is due to how Jinja works when processing the context.  That said, is there a way for me to either make this work, or to access the current execution date outside of macros?  Finally, one other question.  Where are the default variables like `{{ ds }}` set for Airflow.  I've been digging through the code and can't seem to find them.\n\nThanks for the help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131138115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131150958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/257#issuecomment-131150958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/257","id":131150958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTE1MDk1OA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-14T15:32:27Z","updated_at":"2015-08-14T15:32:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here is where the context object is created:\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/master/airflow/models.py#L914\n\nJinja doesn't do a multi-pass rendering, so when it resolves `{{ procDt}}` is replaces it with `'{{ execution_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') }}'` and this is what you end up with.

As you get closer to 5 minutes scheduler intervals, you need to start thinking in terms of realtime / stream processing and use the systems designed to do that (storm, spark streaming, ...)\n\nWhat is your unit of work? What's you pivot point, as in one dag per **blank** ? file?\n\nbtw you can generate dags dynamically, the same way that you can generate tasks dynamically, you just have to stamp it in the global namespace of your module. But I get a sense that you are bending Airflow in doing things it wasn't designed for, which is fine if it works for you.\n\n```\nbusiness_units = ['CA01', 'US01', 'US02']\nfor bu in in business_units:\n    globals()[bu] = DAG(dag_id=bu)\n    ...\n```\n\nAll of these would show up in the UI\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131264644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131266654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/167#issuecomment-131266654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/167","id":131266654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTI2NjY1NA==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-14T23:25:56Z","updated_at":"2015-08-14T23:25:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1:

I'm impressed with the quality of the PR upon first scan. \n\nI was a bit surprised to see how XComs are associated with (up to) 2 task instances (from and to), which makes sense to me now, somehow I just thought they'd be associated to just one. The most common use case (I believe) is to leave a piece of information behind as you run a task, and let other tasks read from it as in `ti.xcom_pull(key='url', task_id='fetch_endpoint')`.\n\nThe fact that the framework allows for multiple keys can be confusing if you think of this with a key/value mindset. Somehow for the most simple usage it'd be nice to just get the deserialized object out of `ti.xcom_pull` as opposed to a pandas dataframe with N objects. The pandas df can be also confusing for people not familiar with pandas.\n\nAlso to think about is what happens if a task is re-run. Should the key be overwritten? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131871096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131896949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/265#issuecomment-131896949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/265","id":131896949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTg5Njk0OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T17:28:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-17T17:28:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks awesome!\n![screen shot 2015-08-17 at 10 28 19 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/487433/9311399/b999b646-44ca-11e5-98ac-7b70f27480ac.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/131896949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
