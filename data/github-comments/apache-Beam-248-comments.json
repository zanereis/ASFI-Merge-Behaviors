What do you think about moving this to a branch? My reasoning is:\r\n- Any PR review will be hard, especially for a non-complete transformation. Similarly not-committing will be hard.\r\n- Even after full completion, we may not want to release changes as broad as this to the next available release, and allow some time to bake in a branch.\r\n- A branch will not be affected by changes in the master at random times, we can control when to pull from master.\r\n\r\n/cc: @aaltay ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/325480792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
