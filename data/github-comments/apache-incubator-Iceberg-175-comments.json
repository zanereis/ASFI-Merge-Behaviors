This helps a lot.\r\n1. I remember issues using Iceberg with Hive 2.1.x versions before - they have popped  up several times before, so you can expect further issues down the line. Maybe column pruning? Maybe writes to the Iceberg table through Hive... TBH I do not remember exactly, but you might want to search previous issues on github to save some headaches later.\r\n2. I think the issue is that you are trying to connect 2 HMS instances and you would like to create the cross HMS HiveCatalog for the Iceberg tables. This is not something that is supported yet in Iceberg.\r\n\r\nI see 2 options:\r\n- Could you use a different catalog for the ingest? Maybe simple HadoopTables, or HadoopCatalog? In this case you can read the table from Hive creating a simple Iceberg table using the specific catalog.\r\n- Could you use the same HMS DB for you 2 Hive instances? In this case you will have the same tables, and no issues","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1144875534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1144880889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4924#issuecomment-1144880889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4924","id":1144880889,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85EPX75","user":{"login":"chixiaopao","id":101961274,"node_id":"U_kgDOBhPOOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101961274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao","html_url":"https://github.com/chixiaopao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chixiaopao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-02T13:41:35Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T13:41:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Also what happens when you simply select *?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I can't reproduce this problem, it's most likely caused by the version of flink we maintain internally. so I will close this issue.

Introducing our own retries can ultimately conflict with other retries and can have some bad side-effects (like failures resulting in retries on top of retries).\r\n\r\nYes you are right, I actually plan to add one more PR for configuring retry policy. The issue here is a bit different. I think there are 2 issues that cannot be handled at SDK level:\r\n1. AWS SDK only handles exceptions up to the AWS client calls, in this case `s3.getObject`. Once you get the input stream, further exceptions are not handled during operations like `read` and `seek`, and that's typically when network issues like connection timeout or socket timeout might happen. I haven't found logic in the SDK that could close a stream, re-seek to the right position and retry a read operation, but maybe I missed some code places.\r\n2. When closing the input stream, the closing should call `abort` instead of `close` to terminate the HTTP connection. This should be done both at retry and stream close time.

So that’s fine.\r\n\r\nThanks for weighing in @RussellSpitzer ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1146868577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1146868886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4960#issuecomment-1146868886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4960","id":1146868886,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85EW9SW","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-05T19:20:27Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T23:58:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The reason we aren't doing this currently is explained in the tests that is failing on this branch :)\n\nWhen we do the pass through like in this PR we throw an error that looks like the commands are completely invalid.\n\nSee\n\n```\n302 org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.TestCallStatementParser > testCallParseError FAILED\n303 java.lang.AssertionError: [Should fail with a sensible parse error] \n304 Expecting throwable message:\n305  \"\n306 mismatched input 'CALL' expecting {'(', 'ADD', 'ALTER', 'ANALYZE', 'CACHE', 'CLEAR', 'COMMENT', 'COMMIT', 'CREATE', 'DELETE', 'DESC', 'DESCRIBE', 'DFS', 'DROP', 'EXPLAIN', 'EXPORT', 'FROM', 'GRANT', 'IMPORT', 'INSERT', 'LIST', 'LOAD', 'LOCK', 'MAP', 'MERGE', 'MSCK', 'REDUCE', 'REFRESH', 'REPLACE', 'RESET', 'REVOKE', 'ROLLBACK', 'SELECT', 'SET', 'SHOW', 'START', 'TABLE', 'TRUNCATE', 'UNCACHE', 'UNLOCK', 'UPDATE', 'USE', 'VALUES', 'WITH'}(line 1, pos 0)\n307\n308 == SQL ==\n309 CALL cat.system radish kebab\n310 ^^^\n311 \"\n312 to contain:\n313  \"missing '(' at 'radish'\"\n314 but did not.\n315\n```\n\nThis test is for checking that when you have a parser failure we throw a relevant message. With the pass-through we end up failing back to the delegate parser and return a generic error. Currently the Iceberg code returns an error message with the correct relevant parse error. In this case \"missing '(' at 'radish'\" instead of \"mismatched input CALL\". Our message helps the user, while the \"mismatch\" error leaves a users wondering if they configured the extensions correctly. These messages also provide no way to actually know why the rules were not applied.\n\nSo even if other engines are doing it differently I would be against changing our implementation unless the test that is currently failing can pass.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1146868886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1146869834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4849#issuecomment-1146869834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4849","id":1146869834,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85EW9hK","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-05T19:27:33Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T19:31:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If anybody is interested in working on this, as I mentioned before the best place to start the work would be around here as this method is where the `mergeSchema` logic begins.\r\n\r\nOriginal PR introducing functionality: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/commit/69c06cead6e5ddfe58c17630c4863eb98e04ff4e#diff-9eb9256d82cd6ab19f73c941a7011ff4973eb61255c7fee0b38402f922a2e48cR239\r\n\r\nMethod itself as of today’s master branch in Spark 3.2: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/69c06cead6e5ddfe58c17630c4863eb98e04ff4e/spark/v3.2/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/SparkWriteBuilder.java#L228","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1146869834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1146877972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4911#issuecomment-1146877972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4911","id":1146877972,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85EW_gU","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-05T20:25:22Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T20:25:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kbendick this PR is orthogonal to PR #4943 .
