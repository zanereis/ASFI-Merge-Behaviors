is no `submitter team` in the ASF.\r\nThe committer team is the one is trusted by the PMC(Project Management Committee), who could do routine code review and merging. The PMC is a smaller group of people watching and sheepherders of the project. \r\n\r\nThis doc would show how a committer gets promoted, https://skywalking.apache.org/docs/main/latest/en/guides/asf/committer/, and here are the current committers and PMC members, https://skywalking.apache.org/team/.\r\n\r\nThe basic principle is, that you need to begin contributing to the project through pull requests, such as bug fixing, or begin to work on a new feature if you have an idea, the idea gets discussed, and at least one of PMC gets you to support to do.\r\n\r\nSkyWalking is a community of volunteers, so, there is no one to assign you anything, you need to find things to do because you feel you want to.\r\n\r\nAbout this feature(endpoint name-based search), the conclusion was made, that unless we have committers to initial a new discussion again, we wouldn't accept it back in the mainstream. This is how a community works, we have 600+ code contributors, and countless users. The decision is the decision, very serious, not be able to change randomly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1128659150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1128738471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9080#issuecomment-1128738471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9080","id":1128738471,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85DRy6n","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T11:12:26Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T11:12:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Both of them should be VIRTUAL_MQ.\nWould you fix this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1128738471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1128740823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9080#issuecomment-1128740823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9080","id":1128740823,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85DRzfX","user":{"login":"Cool-Coding","id":29882506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODgyNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29882506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding","html_url":"https://github.com/Cool-Coding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cool-Coding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T11:15:13Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T11:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Both of them should be VIRTUAL_MQ.

Thanks for reporting the potential problem, you checked the `Yes I am willing to submit a PR!` button, are you currently investigating a fix? It's not necessarily called a bug as there's no problem with the agent code, it's related to how Python works.\r\n\r\nThis is the same problem that many issues have mentioned, pre-fork server models do not work out-of-box with spawned threads in Python, that is - you used `http_server.start(2)`. Here you have two identical processes handling the traffic where only one agent is attached to the original process. \r\n\r\nYou need to pass a post_fork hook definition to the server, and pass to the server config/ startup command\r\n```\r\n# This is pseudo code\r\ndef post_fork():\r\n\tagent.start()\r\n\tblabla\r\n```\r\nas we discussed in many places. (no one mentioned explicitly Tornado yet, so you could help to enhance the documentation FAQ to mention how to configure the hook for Tornado, I'm not sure if there's a way for its built-in server?
