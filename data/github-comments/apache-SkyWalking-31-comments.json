It is complex to end user, but really necessary. Also I agree with you, if some one uses AOP for their bean classes, and try to serialize them, which may be highly possible to trigger this issue.\r\n\r\nSo I think the solution for this, should not just fix bugs. Instaed I suggest we provide a new patch for Spring AOP.\r\n\r\n@candyleer Are you aware of that, we are providing a Spring core patch, to make sure a normal class would be transferred to a dynamic interface instance, because SkyWalking add an interface for each enhanced class(That interface includes #get/#set methods of dynamicField). SkyWalking spring patch  forces the Spring core to use `CglibProxyFactory#createCglibProxy` instead of `JDKProxy`, even the class has the `EnhancedInstance` interface.\r\n\r\nAs same as Spring core patch, we should provide a Spring aop patch. This patch will filter all `getSkyWalkingDynamicField` and `setSkyWalkingDynamicField` from the `EnhancedInstance`'s implementor classes, when they are matched by some AOP mechanism.\r\n\r\nCould you start to find the Spring AOP core codes, to find out how Spring filters classes and methods?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/384170942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/384173207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/989#issuecomment-384173207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/989","id":384173207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDE3MzIwNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T06:21:10Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T06:21:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ajanthan I didn't receive any update about this. @ascrutae Any clue about these two?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/384173207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/384173726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/705#issuecomment-384173726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/705","id":384173726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDE3MzcyNg==","user":{"login":"wengangJi","id":5129542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjk1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi","html_url":"https://github.com/wengangJi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wengangJi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T06:23:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T06:23:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The protobuf compiler relies on glibc, and most Linux systems support glibc, but there are individual still unsupported, so this is a problem.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem for skywalking itself, but a problem with underlying infrastructure, but it still needs to be avoided.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n1.
