I have thought about these containers for quite a while, however it would be good to think deeper and have a RFC discussion around the case.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I think it would be great to understand the future interactions with the existing tir constants in TVM, namely IntImm and FloatImm.\r\n\r\nRight now the runtime conversion automatically converts the values into Integer and FloatImm when a container is required. If we are going to introduce the current container types, we would need to think about how does the types interact with each other in the existing operator overloading mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth to talk about whether or not should we move the Integer container to directly use the runtime int.\r\n\r\nFinally, we should think about implications around operator overloading rules in c++ and python. when we mix IntImm and Int, and themselves as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/791078764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/791095757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7246#issuecomment-791095757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7246","id":791095757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTA5NTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"zhuwenxi","id":4969797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njk3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4969797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuwenxi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuwenxi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T02:17:28Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T02:19:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would you prefer me to fire a PR for llvm/stackvm fix, so you can start review first?

Actually in general for targets in TVM it is not easy to obtain meta-information without inspecting the code.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd like to make the targets self-documenting, so that we don't need to update a page and keep it in sync with changes we do in the code, and users can find useful help on the `--help` option - it is fine if you have your own documentation page, to write about the options, but I'm not sure this should be our _official_ documentation. So that would be my recommendation for now.\r\n\r\nI was planning to submit a separate PR, making `--help` list the available TVM targets plus our composite targets here. This one is very easy (yet not 100% complete as a feature), but I think should be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nFor the inner options, such as `-mcpu` for `llvm`, and `-dpu` for `vitis-ai`, I think it would require a bit of refactoring, to make that an exposed API in TVM level, just consuming that on TVMC.\r\n\r\nConcretely, I don't think this should block your PR here.

In short, `target_host` should not become an unused-argument anywhere after this PR. Since this warning has been disabled in TVM pylintrc, manual check should be done for this case.\r\n> \r\n> For API updating, I'd suggest either of the following approaches (can be applied case by case):\r\n> \r\n> 1. Simply remove the `target_host` argument if that API is seldemly used.\r\n> 2. Keep the `target_host` argument, but log out a warning saying this is not effective anymore and will be deprecated.\r\n\r\nThanks Cody for the advice. Of course, if you spot any unused `target_host` hanging out there and we should simply remove that. For simplicity we should definitely remove `target_host` and replace it with `target.host` in most occurance. I did not remove all of them mainly because of two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. For heterogeneous targets, there could be multiple targets maintained in a dict, which makes a single target_host more convenient in related context.\r\n2. It takes more time to replace all the occurance, and part of the code would be refactored, e.g., the structure of `SearchTaskNode` and the signature of `target_host` related functions, once we decide to deprecate `target_host`. I want to leave the work later if we decide on deprecation and be more consistent in design at that time.\r\n\r\nFor API updating, both would be good choice. I would post two of them onto the [RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-tvm-target-specification/6844/56) and see what others think and decide.

I was hoping that the `requantize` could also be represented using the `simulate_q` (or `simualted_requantize` op) where both `in_dtype` and `out_dtype` are integers (while the actual in/out tensors are fp32). The issue representing `requantize` with a sequence of `quantize-dequantize` is that requantize's integer-only computation gives different results compared to the sequence of quantize-dequantize (the deviation grows further for <8 bits). If there was just one op, then we can simulate `requantize` with hopefully more fidelity (should help QAT as well in future).\r\n\r\nBut I totally understand that it can make design complicated and maybe also difficult to pattern match.

Could you elaborate you proposal?\r\n> \r\n> I think this is not related to what codegen you are using? Based on the functionality of this PR, what you need is getting rid of some constatnts in the metadata module. Then it should be fine to put this logic to the ACL specific constant updater. @mbaret could you comment whether this proposal would work?\r\n\r\nApologies @comaniac that I missed this earlier. We did explore using the same fix as for Ethos-N (giving a 'null' ConstantUpdater), but this doesn't work for ACL as ACL does load the constants from MetadataModule. Ethos-N just directly serializes the constants into the binary module so it doesn't care if they're missing in the MetadataModule.\r\n\r\nThis problem seems quite fundamental to me and shouldn't just affect ACL, but any BYOC target that tries to make use of MetadataModule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> I think this is just a work around.
