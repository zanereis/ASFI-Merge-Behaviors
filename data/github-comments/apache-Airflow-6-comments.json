Regardless of the outcome, you want the chain to proceed. \n\nIn this case, I would just use a Python operator for all of my tasks. In each Python operator, I would catch and eat any errors or exceptions raised inside the task code body so that the next operator could proceed. In the end, all of your PythonOperator tasks will appear on the UI as having succeeded, even if they did not. \n\nIf you actually want to retain information about what passed and what failed, it sounds like we need support for a new configuration parameter at the task level : `continue_on_failure =  True`. Is that what you are asking for? \n\nIf so, then it does sounds dubious at first glance, especially if I think about typical ETL-style workloads. In ETL-style work-loads, it's generally a bad practice to `continue_on_failure`. However, I can envisage use-case where you are trying to load some 3rd party data or keep some cache fresh, and you don't have control over the availability of that 3rd party data source. In these cases, best-effort is all you can do. And in such cases, having an accurate history, especially a visual history such as shown below, would be very useful.

Can close this issue now.\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/127084393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/127122987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/213#issuecomment-127122987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/213","id":127122987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzEyMjk4Nw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-03T04:49:14Z","updated_at":"2015-08-03T04:49:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We're all using `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` and it's fine, I'd be curious to see the stack traces for some of these errors.\n\nAbout `libsasl2-dev`, I assume you installed `airflow[hive]`, I think sasl is needed by pyhs2.\n\nI'll try installing on a fresh Ubuntu install and see what kind of troubles I hit. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/127122987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/127138684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/212#issuecomment-127138684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/212","id":127138684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzEzODY4NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-03T06:29:59Z","updated_at":"2015-08-03T06:29:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm surprised that there isn't some sort of authentication required.

If task A is at 00:33 and task b is at 00:35 when you switch to a daily job, the dependencies will not line up in time when adding a day to both. Anyhow. For testing purpose every minute _should_ work, though daily should work just as well. Just make sure to clear the history and set your `start_date` to where you want it as you change the schedule.\n\nSo it looks like your scheduler is aware of your DAG, and the worker too. First thing I would do would be to look into the log file on the worker (if you cannot see). Was that job triggered by the scheduler or the UI \"run\" button?\n\nIs the scheduler emitting messages?

think that an `impersonate` flag in BaseOperator could be a decent generic way to help around security and attribution of \"who is running what\", even if Airflow is triggering the job.\n\nThe way

This assumes unix based roles and security to be deployed on workers. Of course many systems (take mysql for instance) don't support unix-type authentication.\n\nImpersonate could be forced to `True` for given operators using the undocumented `policy` feature described in `settings.py`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128153763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128173616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/220#issuecomment-128173616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/220","id":128173616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODE3MzYxNg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T22:48:04Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T22:48:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There's currently no easy way to do this in Airflow.

I don't see a great way to handle that in Airflow. Here are some rambling thoughts...\n\nThis manifests in two ways:\n1. a task whose parameters depend on information discovered by earlier tasks (as described by @griffinqiu and @kwent)\n2. a task whose existence depends on information discovered by earlier tasks (haven't seen anyone mention this yet, but I think it's the larger issue -- basically a superset of the first one)\n\nIssue 1) could be solved with a convenience function for serializing data to the database. That could be injected into the context, as @mistercrunch wrote, or simply persisted in a table (it seems like Variables, or something like Variables, are the right approach here. Using callbacks and context requires users to first store objects in context, then write a callback... it seems like the logic could be wrapped up nicely in a function and sanitized/checked for compatibility in the process. I will open a separate issue to discuss this.) I think, broadly speaking, that it's healthy to split up any logical task into small pieces even if the unit of work is small, if only because it leads to better monitoring of progress and errors.\n\nIssue 2) is much harder and @griffinqiu's issue could be viewed as a variant of it. Basically, we don't know in advance what tasks we need to run. I think the most common variant of this is \"vertical\" scaling (vertical in the context of the web UI), where I know what tasks I will run, but I don't know how many or with what parameters (i.e. how many vertical rows I'll see in the web UI).\n\nFor example:\n- I want to process every file in a directory (local, FTP, etc.). I don't know the filenames in advance because someone may have put a new file in there since the last time. I also don't want to reprocess files I've already seen. As nice as it would be to have a formal contract with all data, often that's just not the case -- files show up in funny ways and times. So I know the tasks I need to run, but not the input or count\n- I want to run a pipeline with parameters that were produced by another process or pipeline. I don't know in advance how many different sets were produced, so I don't know how many times to run the pipeline. For example, build aggregations of data every X minutes, where X is an array of values generated externally that varies day to day. I don't know X until I reach that point in the pipeline and access it.\n\nAirflow is built around the concept of DAG discovery taking place entirely separately from running them. So this is hard to reconcile with the idea of dynamic DAG building. But perhaps a `DAGOperator` could generate a DAG at runtime and run it ad-hoc, then delete it.

See https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/220, #133 and #12.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure exactly what Variables are being used for but they don't feel like the right place for this specific use -- first because they're publicly/globally visible and we'd end up horribly polluting that namespace, and second because they don't enforce the dag/task/datetime id that this would require.\n\nBut I think they light the path. So I'd propose the following:\n1. based on the code that defines Variables [here](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/1c322b007ec24aeaf9889be44f057d38af3f6c49/airflow/models.py#L1980), create a new table called `State` (or something) keyed by (dag_id, task_id, ds, time_) [_in case there are multiple runs per day?]\n2. add class functions similar to `Variable.get()` which store and retrieve `State`s\n3. add `get_state()` and `set_state()` methods to `PythonOperator` which handle json serialization/loading and creating the proper table key.\n\nSo users could do something like this:\n\n``` python\ndef my_func(x, **kwargs):\n    # get the calling task\n    task = kwargs['task']\n\n    # set_state handles json conversion and generating the \n    # appropriate keys (task_id, dag_id) for storing the value \n    task.set_state('my list', [1, 2, 3])\n\n    # get_state retrieves the most recently saved state called 'my value', \n    # optionally restricting the query to a certain task, dag, or date.\n    #\n    # in this case, we're only getting 'my value' if it was written by a task called\n    # 'my_other_task'\n    state = task.get_state('my value', task_id='my_other_task', dag_id=None, date=None)\n```\n\nMaybe with a little magic we can get rid of needing to access kwargs/pass context, but let's leave that for the future. In fact, I guess users could do that by calling `State.set()` directly, but then they'd have to pass the `task_id` and `dag_id` that the `task` method handles automatically.\n\n@r39132 your point number 3 could be handled with some of the callback functions that I believe were recently handled.\n\nCritically, all the plumbing to do this already exists thanks to `Variable`; just need to write the utility functions. If this is interesting I'll take a crack at it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128408774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128409195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/182#issuecomment-128409195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/182","id":128409195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODQwOTE5NQ==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T15:22:06Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T15:22:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe `save`/`load` or `store`/`retrieve` are the right semantics instead of `get`/`set`... open to suggestions!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128409195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128409272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/221#issuecomment-128409272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/221","id":128409272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODQwOTI3Mg==","user":{"login":"maraca","id":374087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca","html_url":"https://github.com/maraca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maraca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T15:22:24Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T15:22:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch sorry for the delayed responsed I was traveling last night.\n\nThe following is not going to be very useful as I can not for the life of me figure out why it started working.

PythonOperators?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128521979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128522371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/225#issuecomment-128522371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/225","id":128522371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODUyMjM3MQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T22:04:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T22:04:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PR please!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128522371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128531338","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/204#issuecomment-128531338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/204","id":128531338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODUzMTMzOA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T22:44:02Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T22:44:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Click \"mark success\" in the UI?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128531338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128533804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/227#issuecomment-128533804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/227","id":128533804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODUzMzgwNA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-06T22:52:12Z","updated_at":"2015-08-06T22:52:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Are you not running your server as UTC?

SqlAlchemy has a nice pickle type. We could actually put more complex objects in there.\n- The name \"TaskValue\" is confusing to me since it's really attached to a task **instance**. What about xcom for \"cross communication\"\n- The get and set methods could also exist at the TaskInstance object where you already have the `execution_date` parameter\n- This will require an entry in the docs, probably under the \"Concepts\" section for now (once the implementation is clarified and settles)\n- All operators return value (if any) could be left behind for other tasks to read, if it's a pickle it can even be an object, though we have to be careful for people not to put gigantic objects in there.\n- could do the javascript style api where `task_instance.xcom(key=\"foo\")` returns the value, and  `task_instance.xcom(key=\"foo\", value=\"bar\")` sets the value\n\nNow I'm thinking this can also be used in templates `{{ task_instance.xcom(task_id=\"other_task\", key=\"return_value\") }}`!\n\nAwesome.

'draft' is definitely the operative word, this needs to be smoothed out a bit.\n\nTo your points:\n1. Great call, pickles would be much better! I've never used the SqlAlchemy pickletype before -- is [this the one](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.PickleType) you mean? Looks like we just make a column of type `PickleType` and store the pickles there... is it really that straightforward?\n2. Yup, the name is no good. I actually called it State at first before realizing there was something else in the module called State... led to all kinds of issues. XCom works for me. (xcom all lower case?)\n3. I can put methods on TIs. The larger question is, how will people actually call this? The two places that seemed obvious to me off that bat were inside `python_callable` (which is why the xcom class method is needed) and inside `BaseOperator.execute()` (which is why the `BaseOperator` method is needed). What else am I missing? (and how can those signatures be simplified). Your use cases (`task_instance.com()`) look natural, so I feel like that's a better direction than mine, but I want to walk through how the user gets the `task_instance` too... I know I'm revealing my Airflow novice status here)\n4. Once we have all the names and methods down, I'll write a doc/tutorial.\n5. This is a really interesting idea. Maybe with some sort of size check on the pickle to protect against huge objects (if that can be done quickly, I'm not sure). Getting values is, in general, easier for users than setting them -- so if the setting were handled automatically by `return` it would go a long way toward usability (and, I'm guessing, cover the vast majority of use cases where intermediate results aren't important).\n6. I'll admit this makes me a little nervous because the get/set isn't obvious to me... feels a little un-Python. It might be possible to hack a `property` such that `val = task_instance.xcom(key=\"foo\")` is the getter and `task_instance.xcom(key=\"foo\") = val` is the setter. Might not be obvious either.\n\nTemplates... that's a whole new level. I'll let you handle that!\n\nI'll try to pick this back up next week after the Py3 stuff is (hopefully) knocked out.\n\nAlso, pinging @r39132 @griffinqiu @kwent @oren-yowza @Susanne-ywz @seibert @azaroth42 in case they don't get notified.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128593827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/128598032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/232#issuecomment-128598032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/232","id":128598032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODU5ODAzMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-07T05:03:02Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T15:07:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"1. yes, I use it in models.py\n2. `XCom` for the class and `xcom_get` and `xcom_set` maybe for related methods\n3. I'd say methods on both BaseOperator and TaskInstance, for TIs you don't need to specify `execution_date` but you can if you want to go in the past (most use cases should be same schedule or previous I would guess). I like the idea of assuming that `dag_id` and `task_id` are also the same as the the caller's if not specified. You can push Or pull, meaning I could set a message at a destination task, or set one on my own tasks for other tasks to pull.\n4. We can assume people are adults and can hurt their network/DB if they want. It'd be hard to define a sound limit. Maybe warn above a certain size but that's not a needed feature.\n5. Yeah, not very pythonesque, let's stay explicit. XCom object can have `set` and `get` methods, and BaseOperator and TaskInstance can both have `xcom_get`, and `xcom_set`\n\nTemplates come for free since task and task_instance are already in the context for all templates everywhere!

A similar system at Facebook that inspired some of the design decisions behind Airflow is used by hundreds of data people everyday to satisfy a very large array of use cases. I'm convinced there would be a way to solve your use cases with Airflow as it is today, but agree that cross task communication can be more elegant in many cases.\n\n@azaroth42, we use Airflow to trigger Spark, Cascading, Hive, MR, ML, Ruby, Python, MySql, and all sorts of other tasks at Airbnb. Airflow is the orchestra director, it glues all of these systems together in a nice symphony\n\nFor the chunks of pipelines that you'd want to be very dynamic and shape-shifting (I'd like more specific use-cases still to understand what you are all up to!), maybe something external to Airflow like some platform, program, or service can satisfy these use cases.
