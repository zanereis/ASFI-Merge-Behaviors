Client.java&#93;</span>(storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/messaging/netty/Client.java) retry logic and <span class=\"error\">&#91;Utils.java&#93;</span>(storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/Utils.java<br/>\n    ) Curator Framework. <br/>\n    The `StormBoundedExponentialBackoffRetry` provides generic exponential-linear backoff retry policy for STORM. It overcomes the following shortcomings in curator frameworks implementation of `BoundedExponentialBackOffRetry`:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>Limitation maxRetries to 29.</li>\n\t<li>`getSleepTimeMs` fails with IllegalArgumentException by passing -ve argument to random.nextInt if retryCount > 29.</li>\n\t<li>Also, exponential calculation in quickly catches up to `maxSleepTimeMs` - eventually adding more delay and increasing collision possibility.<br/>\n    This class calculates `threshold` for exponentially increasing `sleeptime` for retries. Beyond threshold, the sleep time increase is linear. <br/>\n    It adds jitter for exponential/linear retry.<br/>\n    It guarantees `currSleepTimeMs >= prevSleepTimeMs` and `baseSleepTimeMs <= currSleepTimeMs <= maxSleepTimeMs`</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a

Currently i am running on Apache Storm 0.8.1 and Apache Zookeeper 3.4.6 .  Can you suggest me how should it be fixed on code level while writing spout or bolt  ? .

In general if you kill all of the running topologies before upgrading you will not run into this situation.  There is nothing that your Bolt/Spout code can do to work around this issue.  It is completely internal to storm.
