Just using 1 primary and 1 replica you'll end up with 48 shards for a single day. Our recommendation is to have less than 20 shards per GB of heap and each shard should be around 10 to 50GB in size. I can see how this works out for some heavy users, but it will be a bad choice for many others.\r\n\r\nIMO a combination of [rollover](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-rollover-index.html) and [write index alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-aliases.html#aliases-write-index) would be the more generic solution that gives users fewer chances for bad configurations.\r\n\r\nDo you have like a sample app where I could add the right config to show how this works?

It would have been a mistake to only consider this.\r\n\r\nOkHttp is an extremely elegant library that solves problems well. Especially coupled with its buddies okio moshi and wire, it is very efficient.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't on this issue were several other chats around the bundling of concerns that made a transition sensible:\r\n* interest and hands: without @anuraaga nothing likely would change\r\n* mutual stake: if we didn't already use Armeria, this might not have happened\r\n* digging issue: if we didn't have people continuing to raise issues about https endpoints, this might not have happened. Ex #1611 and several variants with pings on chat\r\n\r\nDespite attempts to be very transparent, sometimes issues are raised all over the place, and discussions don't get copied everywhere. We probably weren't careful enough to elaborate here that this, if anything was a combination of above and timing of hands to do the work.\r\n\r\nI think I can speak for everyone in saying we are happy with all the help we've had from OkHttp and the change here does not imply a change from elsewhere like in Brave and Reporter where we put OkHttp forward in most examples. I tried to touch on this in release notes, but forgot to put something here https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/releases/tag/2.16.2\r\n\r\nEspecially in hindsight, I would recommend projects to think carefully about any transition away from OkHttp, and certainly consider using more of it. Its design is so thoughtful and we really had an easy few years depending on it. It is very efficient in practice, and has been remarkably stable. I would only expect such stability to continue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/524836512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/524839660","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2646#issuecomment-524839660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2646","id":524839660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDgzOTY2MA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T12:25:29Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T12:28:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"fyi @vietj zipkin-junit still uses okhttp.
