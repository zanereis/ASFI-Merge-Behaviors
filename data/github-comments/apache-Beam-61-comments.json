However, generally speaking, as the `MqttIO` `Source` is a subscriber to the MQTT topic, creating several sources means that we will receive the same message multiple time. So, I think we should create an unique source. In that case, I wonder if it doesn't make more sense to use a simple `DoFn` for the `Read` instead of a `Source`. @jkff what do you think ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/259889513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/259970067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1236#issuecomment-259970067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1236","id":259970067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTk3MDA2Nw==","user":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-11T14:37:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T14:37:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, I found the issue: by default mongod (embedded instance) is bound to 27017 (default MongoDB port number).
