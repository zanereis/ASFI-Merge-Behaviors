@loweew \r\n\r\nCan you provide more details about your fine-tuned model? For instance, what command you used in order to fine-tune? I'm assuming when you say you used fine-tune.py you used [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/fine-tune.py).\r\n\r\nAlso, will it be possible to share your fine-tuned model?\r\n\r\nAlso, while we are at this, are you fine-tuning this model: http://data.mxnet.io/models/imagenet-11k-place365-ch/ (resnet-50) so that I can try reproducing this at my end?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/335469270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/335480044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8012#issuecomment-335480044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8012","id":335480044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTQ4MDA0NA==","user":{"login":"mseeger","id":6508962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDg5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6508962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger","html_url":"https://github.com/mseeger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseeger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T13:54:43Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T13:54:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nI can add tests for operators which are callable by users. I'd do:\r\n- forward: comparison Numpy, for float32, float64. It is not clear to me whether NumPy does\r\n   computations in float32, or does not internally use float64 in any case\r\n- finite difference tests in float64. It is our experience that such tests do not work with float32\r\n\r\nI don't think I can test things for other DType, because NumPy only does things for float32 and float64.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong : Do you have other DType in mind? I am not familiar with these exotic \"half\" types.
