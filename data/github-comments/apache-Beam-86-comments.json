Basically overriding Java serialization with Avro, Protobuf, Thrift, or similar.\r\n - Is intended to be communicated between different versions of the code, either via network or storage. In this case also the serialized form should be something other than Java serialization.\r\n\r\nThus, there are very few cases where the warning is helpful, so we disable it globally. I recommend disabling it and not adding this boilerplate.\r\n\r\nThe other changes Look Good To Me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270181431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/270182995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1728#issuecomment-270182995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1728","id":270182995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDE4Mjk5NQ==","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T18:16:43Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T18:16:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.
