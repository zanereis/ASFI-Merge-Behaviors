no session 问题体现出的是业务架构分层涉及的一个典型问题，不是个例。dubbo 服务框架解决的问题不涉及到 ORM 框架，所以这个问题不属于 dubbo 需要解决的问题范畴。这里我给出一个工程上的最佳实践，ORM 框架处理的实体是数据库 DO 对象，而 dubbo 传输的是 DTO 对象，你所要做的是在业务层将数据库的 DO 对象转换成 DTO 对象，由于是你自己的 service，所以不存在 session 关闭的问题，对于 DTO 对象，是不存在懒加载的问题的。\r\n\r\n作为实验性质的解决方案，注意，这可以解决你 no session 的问题，但不被推荐，你可以自定义 dubbo filter，手动操控 spring 的 TransactionMananger，打开事务，可以“解决”你的问题。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/430455150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/430465714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/2522#issuecomment-430465714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2522","id":430465714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDQ2NTcxNA==","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T02:18:58Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T02:18:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"fixed,
