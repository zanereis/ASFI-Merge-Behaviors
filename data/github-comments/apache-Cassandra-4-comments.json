Notice `CassandraIndex` defaults to `ALL` for the state and the `Index#supportsLoad()` method defaults to always `true` except for `NONE`. I would argue that makes any new index implementation concerns for that a zero overload. Like you can ignore it as defaults are already reflecting the std behavior.\r\n\r\nSo given the above it boils down to me seeing this as a feature and you probably as an unnecessary optimization.

The dtest [test_failing_manual_rebuild_index](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-dtest/blob/master/secondary_indexes_test.py#L327) looks ideal for this purpose, we could easily add `node.grep_log` checks after each index (re)build to check that it behaves at is supposed. I don't know if we have tools to verify logs and simulate node restarts in utest.\r\n\r\n> Btw your dtest run looks good.

Extending dtests should be a quite small task, probably just the few log checks mentioned above. It's true that the ticket doesn't solve any serious problem that we have with current implementations, but it's not very invasive and it's almost done, so I would also be in favour of keeping it in 4.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/628120500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/628453321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/575#issuecomment-628453321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/575","id":628453321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODQ1MzMyMQ==","user":{"login":"michaelsembwever","id":559444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTQ0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/559444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelsembwever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelsembwever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-14T07:42:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T07:42:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Merged with 01103111ae08b51ccd18bb1c54ac60546546d9df","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/628453321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/628653408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/570#issuecomment-628653408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/570","id":628653408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODY1MzQwOA==","user":{"login":"bereng","id":6973517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzM1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6973517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng","html_url":"https://github.com/bereng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bereng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-14T13:56:08Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T13:56:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adelapena I have pushed the latest + you can find the dtests PR on the jira ticket.

Set indexes as writable to not miss incoming writes.\r\n2. Flush the base table if some index wasn't writable before, so the potentially unindexed memtable contents are moved to the set of sstables to be indexed.\r\n3. Acquire sstable refs and rebuild.\r\n\r\nI have also done some modifications to the way we determine whether we should use `Index#getBuildTaskSupport` or `Index#getRecoveryTaskSupport`. `SIM#buildIndexesBlocking` is only called by either `SIM#rebuildIndexesBlocking` or `SIM#handleNotification`. I understand that if the caller is `rebuildIndexesBlocking` we are always doing a full rebuild, and probably the only reason to do that is that we are attempting to recover a damaged index. Conversely, if the caller is `handleNotification` we are doing a partial build of new data that is unable to recover previous errors. This is why I think that the `isFullRebuild` argument is enough to determine whether we are recovering or indexing new data. This makes full rebuild independent of the status of the index, so any call to `nodetool rebuild_index` will involve `getRecoveryTaskSupport`, which is intended to do any initialization work that might be needed prior to a full index build. Do you think this assumption is correct, or are we interested in treating separately full rebuilds without a previous failure?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are also slightly modified to reflect the changes. `SecondaryIndexManagerTest` is extended with queryability/writability checks over a write-only-on-failure index.\r\n\r\nSummarizing, I think that at this point the patch achieves the following:\r\n* Full index rebuilds give indexes the opportunity to run specific rebuild logic, including initialization. This logic can be different from the logic that is used when regularly indexing new sstables.\r\n* If any full rebuild or a partial build task fails, the index can start to reject queries and ignore writes until a full rebuild is successfully run. Whether it rejects queries or ignores writes is defined by the index implementation.\r\n* Rebuilt indexes don't miss data after having been ignoring writes.\r\n* Existing indexes preserve their original behaviour. They always accept writes and only reject reads if the initial build has failed.\r\n* The index API is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nDo you think it makes any sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/631559153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/631580379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/597#issuecomment-631580379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/597","id":631580379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTU4MDM3OQ==","user":{"login":"BrynCooke","id":747836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NzgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/747836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke","html_url":"https://github.com/BrynCooke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BrynCooke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T16:21:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T16:21:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like things have changes significantly due to the dtest API being pulled out.

If necessary, it wouldn't be difficult to pass the `LoadType` to the CQL index options, so users can decide how their indexes will behave, choosing between availability and consistency. As for failing writes on badly built indexes instead of ignoring them, we should also have some discussion because it will quite aggressively affect the base table/keyspace availability, messing with repairs, compactions, etc. It will also might make sense to have some mechanism to make coordinators aware of which nodes are not available for reads and writes so they can avoid them.
