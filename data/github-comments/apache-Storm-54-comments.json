One is a highly available store for blobs (we are working on an API for something similar to this for STORM-411) that we can write into it and query it to know that the blob has been persisted.  This could mean adequate replication, or whatever that blob store feels it needs.\n\nThe second thing we want is leader election/fail over for nimbus.\n\nBy separating the two, we can easily have something where we are running on YARN, and we only have one nimbus instance, but the data is stored in HDFS.  Nimbus crashes a new one comes up else where and everything should work just fine.  Or we are running on EC2 and we want nimbus to be hot/warm, but I don't want 3 instances of nimbus because it costs too much, just 2 so I store the data in S3 instead.

If you are not using trident i.e you are using core spout or bolt in a topology it means at-most once semantic. In your example if a user wants to avoid the replays if there is a failure in downstream bolt they can just do ack(tuple) at the top of execute method. This will ack the tuple immediately even if there is a failure after .

rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-618</a>)</p>\n\n<p>    While it's nice for kafka spout to push failed tuple back into a sorted set and try to process it again, this way of guaranteed message processing sometimes makes situation pretty bad when a failed tuple repeatedly fails in downstream bolts since PartitionManager#fill method tries to fetch from that offset repeatedly.</p>\n\n<p>    This is a corresponding code snippet.</p>\n\n<p>private void fill() {<br/>\n    ...<br/>\n    if (had_failed) </p>\n{\noffset = failed.first();\n    }\n<p> else </p>\n{\noffset = _emittedToOffset;\n    }\n<p>    ...<br/>\nmsgs = KafkaUtils.fetchMessages(_spoutConfig, _consumer, _partition, offset);<br/>\n    ...</p>\n\n<p>    So there should be an option for a developer to decide if he wants to process failed tuple again or just skip failed tuple. One of the best thing of Storm is that spout together with trident can be implemented to guarantee at-least-once,exactly-once and at-most-once message processing.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull
