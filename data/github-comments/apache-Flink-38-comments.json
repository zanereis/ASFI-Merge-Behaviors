Evaluation for me means making predictions _and_ evaluating the result using some aggregating metric.

However, IMHO it is the right way to go. I would rather spend more time on getting it right in the first place, than introducing it later on. I added a couple of tests that should ensure that the transitions work correctly. Furthermore, sending \"terminate\" to a source relies on a cooperative source. If the source ignores the signal, it should be in state TERMINATING to indicate the user that the signal was received. If the source ignores the signal, the user can still \"cancel\" the job. Additionally, I can imagine that a source might take a few seconds to stop emitting new data (eg, for checkpoint/consistency reason). For this case, having a separate TERMINATING state is also nice.\n\nSame about extra JobStatus. I rather spent more time and get it right from the beginning on.\n\nI think that sending the terminate signal to sources only is a good idea (I thought about it, too), as other operators ignore the signal anyway. However, I don't know how to distinguish sources from operators/sinks and how to send a signal to dedicated operators only? Furthermore, I would like to enable \"terminate\" signal for streaming jobs only (but once again, I don't know how to distinguish streaming and batch). Can you give some hints how to get both of this done?\n\nAbout AbstractInvocable -> using an interface is fine with me. If we sent the \"terminate\" signal to streaming sources only, it will result in a cleaner design.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114123970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114132214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/801#issuecomment-114132214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/801","id":114132214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDEzMjIxNA==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T14:33:48Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T14:33:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello, wondering what the status is on this PR\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114132214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114134005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/823#issuecomment-114134005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/823","id":114134005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDEzNDAwNQ==","user":{"login":"thvasilo","id":9048995,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDg5OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048995?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo","html_url":"https://github.com/thvasilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thvasilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T14:36:15Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T14:36:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @shakir774 , as @sachingoel0101 mentioned you must rebase your current implementation on the current master as the underlying code for FlinkML has changed considerably.

Ideally, we'd check for every value of every attribute, which would lead to a N*D number of checks at every node [N is the number of instances and D is the dimensionality]. To bring this down, we convert the values for each attribute into a probability distribution using a histogram. After this, we can perform as many splits as we want, not depending on the actual number of training instances. Aside from this, there is nothing special in the paper which is a diversion from the standard decision tree algorithm. \n\nI'll update the branch soon to incorporate your comments. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114173765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114176855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/754#issuecomment-114176855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/754","id":114176855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDE3Njg1NQ==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T16:50:26Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T16:50:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Addressed @tillrohrmann's comments and rebased on master. @tillrohrmann, should we merge with your upcoming changes or can we merge it before?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114176855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/114176858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/677#issuecomment-114176858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/677","id":114176858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDE3Njg1OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T16:50:26Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T16:50:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it will.

Unfortunately, I will be gone until the 13th of July so I will not be able to resolve these issues until then. They are however all valid points. One more note perhaps, in regard to the unit tests, I added the basic ones (based on the Java version of them), but they are most certainly not all there. The same can be said for the methods that were added recently to the java Gelly API.\n\nSince I am a bit strapped for time atm, I was hoping to push this into the official Flink repo (maybe not master

But what is the label? Does it mean that I can apply `predict` on `T <: Vector` and `predictLabeled` on `LabeledVector`? Does it mean that I get a labeled result type? But don't I already get it with `predict`? Do I have to provide a type with a label or can I also supply a vector? \n\nIMO, the prediction which also returns the true label value deserves a more distinguishable name than `predictSomething`, because it has different semantics.

It makes sense to do this before the code writing.\n\nSorry if I appear like the bad guy here. But we are at the verge of getting into spaghetti code and inconsistencies in one of the most crucial parts, and we cannot do that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/115227753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/115228662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/867#issuecomment-115228662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/867","id":115228662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTIyODY2Mg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-25T12:15:07Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T12:15:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, apparently no tests were ever run after these changes.
