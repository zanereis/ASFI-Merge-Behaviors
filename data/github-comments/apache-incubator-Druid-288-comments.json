This PR is a really promising proof of concept, but it's still sort of rough around the edges and I think I can do even better. During this time, I've been thinking of some ideas on how this can better play into the vectorized query engine as well as how to always beat the segment sizes of the current approach. Of course I also still need to resolve the c++/java compatibility issue, because the c++ performance is too good to ignore (and also what LZ4 is doing so not without precedent in Druid) but we need a compatible java implementation in the event the native module is not able to load.\r\n\r\nMy main blocker is that I have just been waiting until I have a contiguous chunk of time to resolve these issues, which with any luck I anticipate will be in a couple of weeks over the holidays 🎄","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565357780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565357797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6016#issuecomment-565357797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6016","id":565357797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTM1Nzc5Nw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T08:56:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T08:56:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue is no longer marked as stale.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565357797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565371363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9017#issuecomment-565371363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9017","id":565371363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTM3MTM2Mw==","user":{"login":"AvinoamBN","id":58564034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTY0MDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58564034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN","html_url":"https://github.com/AvinoamBN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AvinoamBN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T09:37:04Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T09:37:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- Thanks for the reply @**jp707049**, but I've been there already.\r\n\r\n- Thanks @**himanshug**, this sounds like the start of what I'm looking for!\r\n1) My following question would be: How do I query for all of the above metrics you mentioned, but with their \"relationship\" to a specific query?\r\nLike how do I pull information (all those metrics) on a single query?\r\nDoes the queries have some type of uniqueID record that is attached to all relevant data?

If you want to change this architecture design, we should discuss what would be the new architecture and how we want it first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565561810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565583679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8956#issuecomment-565583679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8956","id":565583679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTU4MzY3OQ==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T19:48:12Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T19:48:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 4.What is more,As an open source project, it's worth sacrificing so small memory for thread safe and good extendibility if it does take more memory space.\r\n\r\nSetting aside the discussion on memory usage for now, given that you're already maintaining a fork with presumably larger changes related to multithreaded ingestion, why do you believe that this one change is such a maintenance burden that it needs to be merged upstream?\r\n\r\nWe don't have any plans at the moment to enforce thread safety on `JSONFlattenerMaker` going forward, so there's additionally no guarantee that future changes in this area won't affect your fork.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565583679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/565638975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7076#issuecomment-565638975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7076","id":565638975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTYzODk3NQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T22:52:12Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T22:52:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked as stale due to 280 days of inactivity.

Druid does not dictate how and where emitted metrics are stored. That part of emitter framework is extensible. There are few core implementations like \"logging\", \"http\" etc .\r\n.. and some more in extensions, see https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions.html#community-extensions\r\n\r\nemitter implementation is free to remove some of the high cardinality dimensions such as id, aggregate multiple events etc if target storage system can not handle raw metrics emitted by Druid. That is what is happening in your case I think. Emitter, that your setup is using, is one of those that discards \"id\" dimension and probably aggregating the \"query/time\" into average so what you see is probably the average of two \"query/time\" metric events.\r\n\r\nif you configure \"logging\" emitter, you should see \"id\" dimension in metric event in the log because \"logging\" emitter doesn't filter or aggregate anything but just dumps whatever it gets into the logs.

Do you have any explanation?\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding, that the intention is that var-handles and method handles are to replace unsafe calls.   The way we use Unsafe is mostly to read-write primitives and arrays into blobs of bytes similar to what one can do with the C union / struct.   If we can replicate that with these var-handles, then we will probably be OK. \r\n\r\nWe will also likely need to setup Multi-Release Jars (MRJARS) to accommodate both JDK8 and JDK11 code sets.

@anshbansal thank you for the report! I'm looking at the bug but unfortunately, it's not obvious what could be null here. The NPE happens at the below line:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n            try (InputStream inputStream = objectOpenFunction.open(object);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`objectOpenFunction` cannot be null here since it's always created [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/data/input/impl/prefetch/PrefetchableTextFilesFirehoseFactory.java#L206). If `object` was null, NPE should happen at a different line inside `open()`. I think I need more time to look at this. In the meantime, you can try using the [new inputSource and inputFormat](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/docs/development/extensions-core/s3.md#s3-batch-ingestion-input-source). They are more intuitive than the existing firehose and more flexible to extend. If you still want to use the firehose, you can turn off prefetch by setting ` maxFetchCapacityBytes` to 0 (prefetch isn't that useful and not supported for the new inputSource implementation).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/566839321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/566852861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8909#issuecomment-566852861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8909","id":566852861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Njg1Mjg2MQ==","user":{"login":"jnaous","id":2042890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2042890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous","html_url":"https://github.com/jnaous","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnaous/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-18T03:37:26Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T03:37:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 for driving to a conclusion about test name format.
