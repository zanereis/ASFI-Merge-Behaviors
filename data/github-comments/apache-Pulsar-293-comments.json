> probably we could have a separate CI job, not bound to PRs that runs quarantined tests\r\n> \r\n> Good points @eolivelli. yes that would be required. I believe Airflow CI has such a job.\r\n\r\nYes we have in airflow a separate job. Failure of that job does not stop anything  (it has `continue-on-error: true` set: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/6fd93badaa86d5fd53a8dd9858467ab7e85208a6/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L738 ). But if those Quarantined tests fail, the whole job gets \"red\" status, however you can clearly see that those are the quarantined tests that failed, not the \"stable\" ones. And when you see they are not related to a change you can still merge it.\r\n\r\nSince those tests are flaky but not \"broken\", they do succeed more often than they don't so we notice and can react if we see that those tests in \"Quarantine\" start to fail consistently. This is easy to spot actually if you are active committer who merges a number of commits a day/week. \r\n\r\nWe also have a separate workflow which is \"scheduled\" and only runs quarantined tests, but this did not work as well as I wanted. We were submitting status of such quarantined tests to https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10118 automatically (last 20 runs were kept there). This however turned out to be flaky on its own. \r\nSome of the flaky tests simply hang and then they make this exercise a bit pointless. Also the flaky tests tend to be less flaky when run in isolation so there are tests that always succeed when run separately. We call them Heisentests (akin to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug) and we actually introduced another \"marker\" for those (@heisentests) and they are always run in isolation.\r\n\r\nAlso yeah - we have a bug for every quarantined test:  https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AQuarantine but - due to 2.0.0 release (2 years in the making) and follow up 2.0.1 we are working on on where we fix teething problems of 2.0.0 those are a little neglected - they are all part of the \"2.0 Cleanup milestone\" and I actually hope to get them fixed as soon as we release 2.0.1\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771902672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771905170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9427#issuecomment-771905170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9427","id":771905170,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTkwNTE3MA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T19:15:59Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T19:15:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW.

I am not familiar with OpenShift's container platform, so the context is helpful.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the challenge here comes from competing paradigms between how OpenShift runs containers by default and how EKS (and other platforms) recommend running containers. OpenShift is prescriptive about running the user as part of the root group (so it can ensure containers have the right file permissions) and yet EKS recommends just the opposite (because it expects users to ensure file permissions are correct). Here are the Amazon docs that detail best practices for using a `PodSecurityPolicy` to prevent containers from running as the root user and the root group (https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/pods/#restrict-the-containers-that-can-run-as-privileged). Here is the brief part of the policy with an explicit comment about forbidding the root group.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    fsGroup:\r\n        rule: 'MustRunAs'\r\n        ranges:\r\n        # Forbid adding the root group.\r\n        - min: 1\r\n          max: 65535\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe docker image produced by the `Dockerfile` in this PR would not be able to run with the `PodSecurityPolicy` recommended by EKS.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how to best accommodate both paradigms. While OpenShift allows users to override a pod's UID/GID by specifying `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup`, they discourage it because it could affect other pods running in other namespaces. Here is the reference https://www.openshift.com/blog/a-guide-to-openshift-and-uids and here is the main quote:\r\n\r\n> When the application also needs to be executed under a specific custom UID, then the Pod definition needs to use a ServiceAccount with the RunAsAny privilege and the Pod needs to use the runAsUser to set the UID to the hardcoded UID. NOTE: Using a hardcoded UID is NOT recommended. Among issues with this approach is that it is prone to UID collisions with system UIDs or with UIDs of the same or different application running in a different Namespace expecting to use the same UID.\r\n\r\nIf you're deploying your bookkeeper pods on dedicated hosts, I think that removes their main concern because other namespaces won't be deployed to the nodes. I'm not sure how you're deploying these pods though.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might be beneficial to all is to remove the `VOLUME` instruction from pulsar's `Dockerfile` because it prevents file ownership updates to the `/pulsar` directories in derivative images. Docker does claim that specifying volumes in the `Dockerfile` is best practice [here](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#volume):\r\n\r\n> The VOLUME instruction should be used to expose any database storage area, configuration storage, or files/folders created by your docker container. You are strongly encouraged to use VOLUME for any mutable and/or user-serviceable parts of your image.\r\n\r\nand they mention the limitation of derivative images [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#notes-about-specifying-volumes):\r\n\r\n> Changing the volume from within the Dockerfile: If any build steps change the data within the volume after it has been declared, those changes will be discarded.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I don't know how essential it is to use the `VOLUME` instruction. There are people who seem to think that it does not add enough value to a docker image, as seen in the top answer to this [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44060341/is-it-a-docker-best-practice-to-use-volume-for-the-code).\r\n\r\nBy removing the instruction, it'd make it easier for end users to make derivative images based on the official docker images instead of having to build their own image from source.\r\n\r\nIt might also be relevant to note that kubernetes 1.20 now has a feature to manage the file permissions of volumes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#configure-volume-permission-and-ownership-change-policy-for-pods). I haven't looked into this yet, but I'm wondering if it simplifies this problem by allowing the runtime to make sure the filesystem has the appropriate permissions set. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would think there are more users who are looking for it to run as a non root user and group out of the box, which is why I submitted https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8796.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to produce two images to satisfy the different requirements.\r\n\r\n@sijie - what are your thoughts here? I think we'll need some input from the larger pulsar community.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771935645/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771944428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9349#issuecomment-771944428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9349","id":771944428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTk0NDQyOA==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T20:09:14Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T20:09:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@csthomas1 thanks for fix!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/771944428/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772111905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9419#issuecomment-772111905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9419","id":772111905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjExMTkwNQ==","user":{"login":"zymap","id":24502569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAyNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24502569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap","html_url":"https://github.com/zymap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T00:29:24Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T00:29:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Failing tests record:\r\n\r\nintegration sql:\r\n```\r\nError:  Tests run: 6, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2, Time elapsed: 349.226 s <<< FAILURE!

I added a suggestion of using Awaitility for the waiting loop. \r\n\r\nI have some concerns that the production code has some issues. I wrote about my observations in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9408#issuecomment-771552894 . There was a NPE stack trace with maximum 1024 stack frames. \r\n\r\n[The NPE is easy to fix](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/commit/e8361f3656247a43c8928353d7e0a59784ddd25e)), but the depth of the stack is the concern. I did a quick check in the code and it looks like backoff with some delay is missing in some cases and the leader election can get into a very tight loop. I was hoping that @merlimat could check the comments in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9408#issuecomment-771561839 before #9408 is closed. I guess the other option is that I file a separate bug report about the observation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772344154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772345025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9398#issuecomment-772345025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9398","id":772345025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjM0NTAyNQ==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T08:56:16Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T08:56:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot

@merajblueshift , I checkout the pulsar admin request, it sends a HTTP request like this:\r\n```\r\nPUT /admin/v2/persistent/public/default/test/subscription/test HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept: application/json\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\ncontent-length: 82\r\nhost: localhost:8088\r\nuser-agent: Pulsar-Java-v2.7.0\r\n\r\n{\"ledgerId\":9223372036854775807,\"entryId\":9223372036854775807,\"partitionIndex\":-1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see, it doesn't send a message position like `{\"messageId\": \"latest\"}`.\r\n\r\nIn pulsar admin, we convert the string `latest` to the `MessageId.latest` https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fa41d02bebfd841767846240f3ae574047f118f0/pulsar-client-api/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/MessageId.java#L86\r\n\r\nSo actually, it passes a position ({\"ledgerId\":9223372036854775807,\"entryId\":9223372036854775807,\"partitionIndex\":-1}) to the broker with the REST API.\r\n\r\nI think we should handle the position string like `earliest` and `latest` in the broker like how we did in the pulsar-admin client.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772374199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772380273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9410#issuecomment-772380273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9410","id":772380273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjM4MDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"Anonymitaet","id":50226895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjI2ODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50226895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet","html_url":"https://github.com/Anonymitaet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Anonymitaet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T09:52:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T09:52:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi

I added a suggestion of using Awaitility for the waiting loop.\r\n> \r\n> I have some concerns that the production code has some issues. I wrote about my observations in [#9408 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9408#issuecomment-771552894) . There was a NPE stack trace with maximum 1024 stack frames.\r\n> \r\n> [The NPE is easy to fix](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/commit/e8361f3656247a43c8928353d7e0a59784ddd25e)), but the depth of the stack is the concern. I did a quick check in the code and it looks like backoff with some delay is missing in some cases and the leader election can get into a very tight loop. I was hoping that @merlimat could check the comments in [#9408 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9408#issuecomment-771561839) before #9408 is closed. I guess the other option is that I file a separate bug report about the observation.\r\n\r\nWe can probably wait for couple days and if we don't get reply from him we can probably open another issue for that NPE. I did also see this exception couple of times, but not sure if it's causing any real problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772706265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772711482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9443#issuecomment-772711482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9443","id":772711482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjcxMTQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T18:09:38Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T18:09:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll

I brought up this issue in yesterday's pulsar community meeting, and it sounded like there was consensus that removing the instruction was the right way to go. I have just a little bit more research to do before I submit an update to my PR. I'm hoping to submit an update within 36 hours.\r\n\r\nI believe the main reason this works for both platforms is that by leaving the volume open ended (and not declared in the Dockerfile), the file system permissions will be inherited from the host. In that way, it's up to end users (or the orchestration platform) to ensure their hosts are properly configured. I still need to double check that this is all correct, but that's my current understanding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772900107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/772902471","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/9288#issuecomment-772902471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9288","id":772902471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjkwMjQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T23:37:32Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T23:37:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If all the replicas are not available and data is not recoverable then user can always skip the messages on that cursor using skip-message admin API.
