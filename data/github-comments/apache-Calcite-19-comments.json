The core problem is that `SqlValidator` infers the \"type\" of `SqlDynamicParam` by the \"type\" of `CAST`. And during the optimization, such a `CAST` will be regarded as redundant and get simplified/peeled.\r\n> \r\n> But this PR just fixes the casting to type of `DATE/TIME`, what about other common types? e.g. cast(String as Integer) and so on ....\r\n> \r\n> In my experiment, below simple query is failing\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(\"select \\\"name\\\", \\\"deptno\\\" from \\\"emps\\\" WHERE \\\"empid\\\"=cast(? as INTEGER)\");\r\n>     pstmt.setString(1, \"100\");\r\n>     pstmt.execute();\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I believe I can construct lots of more failures like above. If we only fixs the casting to type of `DATE/TIME` in `RexToLixTranslator.java`, it feels like a too special case for RexToLixTranslator.\r\n> \r\n> How do you think @danny0405 ?\r\n\r\nYour suggestion is impressive and meaningful, other types indeed have the same problem as date, I need to cover all cases when using `SqlDynamicParam ` besides the `date`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/509053107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/509053230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1299#issuecomment-509053230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1299","id":509053230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTA1MzIzMA==","user":{"login":"yuqi1129","id":15794564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk0NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15794564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqi1129","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqi1129/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-08T02:01:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T02:01:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @yuqi1129 THX again for this fix.

@ambition119 Thank you very much for your PR contribution. I have a little suggestion, can you add `TEXT` type in `SqlTypeFixture` and add `TEXT` type test in `SqlTypeUtilTest`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/512206722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/512219449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1307#issuecomment-512219449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1307","id":512219449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjIxOTQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T11:46:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T11:46:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As CALCITE-3113 is already resolved by\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/calcite/commit/0a87daf30d635277b8f1c94355e04ef907fc4002\r\nI will continue working on this PR.\r\n@rubenada @DonnyZone \r\nI updated this PR and tests passed.

types), so a more safer and lightweight way it to use a alias for type `VARCHAR` which  is a more implementable solution.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that the `TEXT` type does not belong to the sql standard, so add it to our exists standard types are not that necessary.\r\n\r\nI do approve of you to add a sql dialect data type if we have a way to make it pluggable and have a clear interface with which user can switch
