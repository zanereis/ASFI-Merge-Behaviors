**@hmcl**, in some project we are tracking the DB activities, we may need the message to be emitted in same sequence as they were polled from Kafka - i.e. polled 5 messages(1~5), if 1, 3, 4, 5 was acked while 2 is failed, seems currently only 2 will be re-emitted , this will cause the sequence is like 1, 3, 4, 5, 2..is it possible to re-emit message from the position that was failed, so the

That would be possible, but is not typically what storm guarantees.  Additionally you would have to configure a lot of other components to maintain that ordering.  Kafka itself does not guarantee this unless you only have a single partition.  Storm cannot guarantee it internally unless you are sending downstream to a single bolt instance, or you have a custom grouping that is smart enough to be able to take it into account.\n\nOrdering guarantees are very difficult in distributed systems and if you can design your system handle out of order data it will be much more robust and scale
