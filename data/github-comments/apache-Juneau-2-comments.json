I wonder if we can detect this and either not run the test or test differently...\r\n\r\nMy local build on Windows 10 is fine.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1307462040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1307489563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/juneau/pull/67#issuecomment-1307489563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/67","id":1307489563,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA9u9-c5N7rUb","user":{"login":"jamesbognar","id":18618374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjE4Mzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18618374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesbognar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-08T16:27:16Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T16:27:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That should be writing to the working directory (./jetty-thread-dump-0.log), not the root directory.

is working as expected.  When parsing JSON with a top-level _type attribute, you have to tell the parser the possible classes it could be through the use of a bean dictionary. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tFoo foo = new Foo();\r\n\r\n\t\tJsonSerializer js = JsonSerializer.create().addRootType().build();\r\n\t\tString json = js.serialize(foo);\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(json);  // {\"_type\":\"foo\",\"bar\":\"x\"}\r\n\r\n\t\tJsonParser jp = JsonParser.create().beanDictionary(Foo.class).build();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tObject o = jp.parse(json, Object.class);\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(o.getClass().getName());  // Test$Foo\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Bean(typeName=\"foo\")\r\n\tpublic static class Foo {\r\n\t\tpublic String bar = \"x\";\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this design:\r\n- The only way to otherwise automatically support your scenario would require scanning the entire classpath looking for classes with @Bean(typeName) annotations in order to build a name/type map.  That would be very expensive.\r\n- Allowing you to specify any type name would be a large deserialization security hole. \r\n\r\nSee the following documentation on bean dictionaries:\r\nhttps://juneau.apache.org/site/apidocs-9.0.1/index.html#jm.BeanDictionaries\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1942143997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1944292665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/juneau/issues/134#issuecomment-1944292665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/134","id":1944292665,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA9u9-c5z4405","user":{"login":"jonathanshraga","id":98614564,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeC9JA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98614564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanshraga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-14T17:33:19Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T17:33:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you,\r\n\r\nI figured as much (the call to beanDictionary).  \r\n\r\nThe challenge I have is that I needed to parse library classes that I don't own, and can't change, and are not annotated.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to use dynamic annotations (via the annotations() API methods) that didn't work. In other words, the  beanDictionary() and annotations() features do not compose.\r\n\r\nI ended up having to implement a mixin like mechanism (similar to Jackson's) which modifies class and/or method level declared annotation metadata via reflection.  This is fragile since it depends on JDK implementation details, and also the semantics of the (default) annotations provider in Juneau (that loads the declared annotations).\r\n\r\nTo summarize. It seem parsing does not support polymorphic parsing with types that do not statically declared annotations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1944292665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1944587197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/juneau/issues/134#issuecomment-1944587197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/134","id":1944587197,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA9u9-c5z6Au9","user":{"login":"jamesbognar","id":18618374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjE4Mzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18618374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesbognar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesbognar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-14T21:04:15Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T21:13:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jonathanshraga - This appeared to work for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage org.apache.juneau;\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.juneau.annotation.*;\r\nimport org.apache.juneau.json.*;\r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tFoo foo = new Foo();\r\n\r\n\t\tJsonSerializer js = JsonSerializer\r\n\t\t\t.create()\r\n\t\t\t.annotations(BeanAnnotation.create(Foo.class).typeName(\"foo\").build())\r\n\t\t\t.addRootType()\r\n\t\t\t.build();\r\n\t\tString json = js.serialize(foo);  // Prints {\"_type\":\"foo\",\"bar\":\"x\"}\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(json);\r\n\r\n\t\tJsonParser jp = JsonParser\r\n\t\t\t.create()\r\n\t\t\t.annotations(BeanAnnotation.create(Foo.class).typeName(\"foo\").build())\r\n\t\t\t.beanDictionary(Foo.class)\r\n\t\t\t.build();\r\n\t\tObject o = jp.parse(json, Object.class);\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(o.getClass().getName());  // Prints \"org.apache.juneau.Test$Foo\"\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic static class Foo {\r\n\t\tpublic String bar = \"x\";\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1944587197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/comments/1947402738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/juneau/issues/134#issuecomment-1947402738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/juneau/issues/134","id":1947402738,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA9u9-c50EwHy","user":{"login":"jonathanshraga","id":98614564,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeC9JA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98614564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanshraga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanshraga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-15T21:55:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T21:55:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks again.
