The rest of the jena-core classes are only used by extensions of Jena and by other jena components, not by applications. There is a chance 3rd party use but it is going to be very uncommon as far as I know. `Serializable` is jena-internal for wiring up RIOT (in jena-arq) into the code engine.  \r\n\r\nOf the classes, `Txn` is more important for applications, and its use encouraged in general user code. `JenaInit` normally isn't called by application code but can be to be sure or to force initialization before calling into internal code very early in the application startup, before proper Jena code.\r\n\r\nI think it is less disruptive to do the split as a rename of \"jena-core:org.apache.jena.system\" as \"jena-core:org.apache.jena.sys\", then put an adapter class `JenaInit` in \"jena-core:org.apache.jena.system\"  that has two functions to call the real `init` and `shutdown`. We immediately deprecate \"jena-arq:JenaInit\" prior to removal quite quickly (in a very few release cycles).\r\n\r\nThis way the impact is lessened: `Txn` is not repackaged. The adapter class approach does not work for calls from jena-core to jena-arq without reflection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/381418402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/381440037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/399#issuecomment-381440037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/399","id":381440037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTQ0MDAzNw==","user":{"login":"christopher-johnson","id":5990301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTAzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson","html_url":"https://github.com/christopher-johnson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-15T21:37:32Z","updated_at":"2018-04-15T21:37:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it may be clearer to close this PR and submit a new one with \"system\" to \"sys\" changes to `org.apache.jena.core` rather than try to merge with this one since there is no overlap.

Does anything break?\r\n\r\nA quick background of the use case might help here.  I have been developing JPMS support for the TrellisLDP project recently and have encountered several blocking dependency issues resulting from `jena-osgi`, which is a [transitive dependency ](https://github.com/apache/commons-rdf/blob/master/commons-rdf-jena/pom.xml#L68-L72) resulting from `org.apache.commons.rdf.jena` that is a direct dependency of the `org.trellisldp.app.triplestore` implementation.  JPMS compilation is strict and cannot resolve a class-containing package sourced from multiple \"parent modules\" (even if the package is private).[1]   A good question here that you raise is what happens if a top level package contains no classes and only exports subpackages.  This requires further investigation and I do not know whether this semi-split, semi-private package, multi-module configuration works, but it is probably not advisable according to the requirements of the [specification](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/reqs/#non-interference).\r\n\r\nRegarding this PR, I am running tests now.  BTW, for me, the shaded-guava jar does not work.   I do not know whether it is my IDE, JRE or the maven build configuration.  At any rate, I can run tests if I replace the shaded-guava with a direct dependency.  Also, `guava 21.0` does not work (without hacking) in a JDK10 because it depends on  `javax.annotation.Nullable`.  (it seems that `guava 24.1-jre` removes the problematic jsr-305 annotations).\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI have solved the test exception issue.  I did not completely revert the first PR initial renaming of system to sys in jena-arq.  \r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40616739/java-9-overlapping-non-exported-packages","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/383892366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/383912994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/390#issuecomment-383912994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/390","id":383912994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MzkxMjk5NA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-24T12:31:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T12:31:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kinow Yep, those Commons threads are exactly what brought it back to my mind.

quick note here about the prospect of further restructuring to support jpms.  I have learned today that if a module (e.g. `org.apache.jena.arq`) does not contain a single top level package this creates an \"ambiguous module\".  The expectation is that the module contains a hierarchy of packages and this does not exist in the primary jena library modules,  It is possible for the top package to not contain any classes, but the `module-info.java`  then must explictly export every subpackage it wants to make public.   With a new package hierarchy, it does not seem possible to maintain compatibility with existing implementations _and_ support modules with jena master.  One possibility might be to create a new branch and produce distinct artifacts that could be used downstream.  It could also be used for testing and making changes to support the new jdk methods without impacting LTS.  btw, I have noticed in running the tests that there are a few issues due to jdk changes (`java.nio.ByteBuffer`, for example).  This might be a question for the dev list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/384432966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/384687828","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/401#issuecomment-384687828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/401","id":384687828,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDY4NzgyOA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T15:38:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T15:38:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This, to my mind, is now well into the realm of 4.0-sized changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/384687828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/384931841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/114#issuecomment-384931841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/114","id":384931841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDkzMTg0MQ==","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-27T10:29:26Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T10:29:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":tada: should I proceed with the merging?

So picked this PR to review, so that I could learn more about Jena internals.\r\n\r\nHad a look at the previous tickets, and from JENA-1534, looks like the query was not considering a variable for a join, I think.\r\n\r\nSo created an empty persistent dataset in TDB, loaded the `books.ttl` from Jena code, and the `yso.ttl` from SKOSMOS in the yso graph (suspected it would have some blank nodes, etc).\r\n\r\nTried the query \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?V0 GRAPH ?g { ?sx ?p ?ox FILTER EXISTS { _:b0 ?p ?V0 } } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it returned few results, quite quickly. So went and tried `tdbquery` from TDB (not TDB2). With following command line (actually in Eclipse, but same as):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ntdbquery --explain --loc=/home/kinow/Development/java/jena/jena/jena-fuseki2/jena-fuseki-core/run/databases/p1/ \"SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?V0 GRAPH ?g { ?sx ?p ?ox FILTER EXISTS { _:b0 ?p ?V0 } } }\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding also `-Dlog4j.configuration=file:///tmp/log4j.properties -Dlog4j.debug=true` to see the explain output.\r\n\r\nWith the code from master, it took <2 seconds to execute the query, and produced the following algebra:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n12:36:03 INFO  exec                      :: QUERY\r\n  SELECT  *\r\n  WHERE\r\n    { ?s  ?p  ?V0\r\n      GRAPH ?g\r\n        { ?sx  ?p  ?ox\r\n          FILTER EXISTS { _:b0  ?p  ?V0 }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n12:36:03 INFO  exec                      :: ALGEBRA\r\n  (sequence\r\n    (quadpattern (quad <urn:x-arq:DefaultGraphNode> ?s ?p ?V0))\r\n    (filter (exists\r\n               (quadpattern (quad ?g ??0 ?p ?V0)))\r\n      (quadpattern (quad ?g ?sx ?p ?ox))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that was a sequence (related to `OpSequence` in Jena, which I'm using to search in Eclipse for occurrences to see how it's used). Checked out the branch.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ git fetch --all\r\n$ git fetch github refs/pull/409/head:pr-409\r\n$ git checkout pr-409\r\n$ mvn clean install -Pdev -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n\r\nDid the `tdbquery` command again, now the algebra became:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n12:41:48 INFO  exec                      :: QUERY\r\n  SELECT  *\r\n  WHERE\r\n    { ?s  ?p  ?V0\r\n      GRAPH ?g\r\n        { ?sx  ?p  ?ox\r\n          FILTER EXISTS { _:b0  ?p  ?V0 }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n12:41:48 INFO  exec                      :: ALGEBRA\r\n  (join\r\n    (quadpattern (quad <urn:x-arq:DefaultGraphNode> ?s ?p ?V0))\r\n    (filter (exists\r\n               (quadpattern (quad ?g ??0 ?p ?V0)))\r\n      (quadpattern (quad ?g ?sx ?p ?ox))))\r\n12:41:48 INFO  exec                      :: TDB\r\n  (join\r\n    (quadpattern (quad <urn:x-arq:DefaultGraphNode> ?s ?p ?V0))\r\n    (filter (exists\r\n               (quadpattern (quad ?g ??0 ?p ?V0)))\r\n      (quadpattern (quad ?g ?sx ?p ?ox))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nA join ! If I understood the tickets, that's the exactly intended behaviour, as before the variable in the exist was not being taken into consideration to produce a `JOIN` (`OpJoin`). The query also took much longer, >10 seconds (I guess SKOSMOS' YSO vocab has something like ~220K triples? The Harry Potter books dataset should have like 5? anywho).\r\n\r\nSo +1 ! LGTM :tada: \r\n\r\nWill probably spend some time reading more of the code base to see if I can learn a bit more. And found two posts ([1](https://gregheartsfield.com/2012/08/26/jena-arq-query-performance.html) [2](https://www.slideshare.net/olafhartig/the-semantics-of-sparql) with some interesting content. In case you have any other pointers to learn more about it, or if I said anything silly, feel free to correct/share, please :-)\r\n\r\n*ps: while reading the javadocs of the `Op*` classes, noticed some typos in OpSequence. Should I open a pull request for that, or just commit to master?*\r\n\r\n```java\r\n-/** A \"sequence\" is a join-like operation where it is know that the \r\n- * the output of one step can be fed into the input of the next \r\n+/** A \"sequence\" is a join-like operation where it is known that\r\n+ * the output of one step can be fed into the input of the next\r\n  * (that is, no scoping issues arise). */\r\n \r\n public class OpSequence extends OpN\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/385127378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/385213050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/411#issuecomment-385213050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/411","id":385213050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTIxMzA1MA==","user":{"login":"christopher-johnson","id":5990301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTAzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson","html_url":"https://github.com/christopher-johnson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christopher-johnson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-28T23:47:13Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T23:47:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"TDB2 depends on dboe-trans-data and transitively on dboe-transaction and dboe-base.

Background on the `dependency=\"true\"` attribute is available in the [Karaf documentation](https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/provisioning).\r\n\r\nI tested this in two ways. First, simply provisioning the `jena` feature in Karaf 4.2.0 works via `feature:install jena`.

Tokenizer specs work with `ConfigurableAnalyzer` and are ignored in `text:GenericAnalyzer`. Perhaps a warning should be logged but that means checking for the presence of unsupported predicates?\r\n\r\nRe:\r\n> the complexity put on TextIndexLucene. A few methods are getting a boolean flag to change their behaviour. And when that happens too much, sometimes it may feel like the method has two behaviours, and writing tests or changing it may be challenging. Maybe it could extend it in some other way.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to improve this. The flag in `highlightResults` affects the value of the `effectiveField` in the context of a larger method, and the flag in `getQueryAnalyzer` conditions whether any useful work is done or not. I factored that as a method rather than leaving it inline in `query$` to reduce the clutter in that principal routine.\r\n\r\nRe:\r\n> it's not a batteries-included feature, if I understand correctly. You still need to prepare the other part of the solution, be it a tokenizer that gets a value such as \"kinou\", then searches some dictionary, and finally create tokens for :ex3 dc:title \"昨日\" and \"きのう\", or change the data a bit. Maybe this could be a separate project, or an extension of sorts.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you are recommending here. The `text:searchFor` and `text:auxIndex` functionalities are ways of configuring the _application_ of appropriate analyzers that have been separately defined. So yes the features are not self-contained in that analyzers do have to be supplied.\r\n\r\nFor reference here is the index description for Tibetan and Chinese that we're using:\r\n\r\n    # Text
