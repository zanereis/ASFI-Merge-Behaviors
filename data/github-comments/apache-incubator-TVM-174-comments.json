XGBoost now is version `1.0.2`, and I can still reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nTo give some context, this is the function call that triggers the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/54975a3fd24fa45b815be39075f4614e53009444/python/tvm/autotvm/tuner/xgboost_cost_model.py#L262-L272\r\n\r\nI tried just creating pickle files of some inputs (`self.xgb_params` and `dtrain`) and simplifying the function call, but this is not enough to reproduce the issue. The issue seems to be in the context  `custom_callback`, below:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/54975a3fd24fa45b815be39075f4614e53009444/python/tvm/autotvm/tuner/xgboost_cost_model.py#L419-L526\r\n\r\nNow, something that could help me a bit to narrow down where the problem is if I run XGBoost in debug mode. @hcho3 what is the simplest way I can do that?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/608599550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/608610090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5028#issuecomment-608610090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5028","id":608610090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODYxMDA5MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T19:07:53Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T19:07:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"please followup, or close the PR if it is superseded by the later ones","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/608610090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/608610213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5230#issuecomment-608610213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5230","id":608610213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODYxMDIxMw==","user":{"login":"shoubhik","id":2293791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTM3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2293791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik","html_url":"https://github.com/shoubhik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T19:08:09Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T19:08:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The context for the change is this -
