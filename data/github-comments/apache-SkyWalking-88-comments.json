Could you explain more? In your scenario, which service triggers the rollback? I expect you could show the trace, one service fails, then TM/TC works together to make other services rollback too.\r\n\r\nyes I'll elaborate more on this, in this example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    @GlobalTransactional(timeoutMills = 300000, name = \"dubbo-demo-tx\")\r\n    public void purchase(String userId, String commodityCode, int orderCount) {\r\n        LOGGER.info(\"purchase begin ... xid: \" + RootContext.getXID());\r\n        storageService.deduct(commodityCode, orderCount);\r\n        if (orderCount % 2 == 0) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"xxx\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- the `business.purchase` throws exception after calling `storageService.deduct` but before the global transaction finished\r\n\r\n- the exception triggers the `TransactionManager` (TM) to request (from TC) a rollback\r\n\r\n- the `TransactionCoordinator` (TC) requests all the `ResourceManager`s to roll back\r\n\r\nbelow the highlighted span is where the `RM` does the rollback operation (by doing some compensative operations) as the `TC` demanded\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15965696/58757719-c66f5980-8543-11e9-9603-2ae9b64953c7.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15965696/58757726-ea329f80-8543-11e9-887e-feb3d98e9e03.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/498004526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/498018151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/2727#issuecomment-498018151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2727","id":498018151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODAxODE1MQ==","user":{"login":"SkyWalkingRobot","id":35362890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzYyODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35362890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyWalkingRobot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-02T10:22:00Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T10:22:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here

Which values of these status?\r\n\r\nIt looks like http status. But it uses `0` instead of `2xx` and uses `500` instead of less than `100`. \r\n\r\n> Why doesn't this match the span duration? If this represents target(solr server) duration, we should have solr server trace in next step, right? Then we still don't need this.\r\n\r\nYes. It represents elapsed time on server side. It exclude http, de/en-serialized time-consuming.\r\n\r\n> And in your example, could you tell me, what does mycore mean? Look like your operation name include it.\r\n\r\nThat likes table name in SQL.  It consist of shards and replicas. If the request sends to the specified sharding, the operation name will use sharding name( it names `collectionName_shardingNum_replicaNum`). However collection name will be contained. So it can be removed.\r\n\r\n> About `docsSize`, `delete.by`.\r\n\r\nI think they are useful. `delete.by` likes deleting statement in SQL. I will move it to `db.statement`. `docsSize` represents the number of effected rows in the upserting.\r\n\r\n> commitWithin, softCommit, maxOptimizeSegs\r\n\r\nThey may not be useful for single request analysis, but they let us know what is done to the server and what state the server is in. But for caller, they are really useless. For me, a ops of solr, they are a bit important.
