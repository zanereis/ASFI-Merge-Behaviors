This is the Jenkins log screenshot of undertow-scenario submitted earlier, because the bug in the use case blocked the test for 2 hours. \r\n(这是之前提交```undertow-scenario```时的Jenkins日志截图，因为用例的bug阻塞了测试2小时)\r\n![WechatIMG7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26432832/67680206-bdd16100-f9c5-11e9-8389-f06914abc14b.png)\r\nthere is no possibility of retrying, so we need to timeout\r\n2.  The ```EntryService``` of ```kafka-scenario``` needs to wait for ```ConsumerThread``` to complete before it can respond, which may take up to 10s. If you don't wait or time out by 3 seconds, the mock-collector may not have received all the data yet. Here, EntryService blocking is reasonable in my view (```kafka-scenario```的```EntryService```需要等待ConsumerThread完成才能响应，最长可能等待10s, 如果不等待或者3秒超时，mock-collector可能还没有收到全部的数据，这儿EntryService阻塞我认为是合理的)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/b3da85b52684834f0e39a02ef6998499db81327a/test/plugin/scenarios/kafka-scenario/src/main/java/test/org/apache/skywalking/apm/testcase/kafka/controller/CaseController.java#L66-L87\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/b3da85b52684834f0e39a02ef6998499db81327a/test/plugin/scenarios/kafka-scenario/src/main/java/test/org/apache/skywalking/apm/testcase/kafka/controller/CaseController.java#L158-L191\r\n\r\n3. I modified ```undertow-scenario``` on fork project, ```EntryService``` slept for 8 seconds before responding, and the probability of missing ```operationNames``` was almost 100 percent. However, we changed the timeout time of ```EntryService``` to 30 seconds or 60 seconds, which could be avoided, not affecting normal use cases, but improving stability for special use cases like ```kafka ```\r\n(我修改了fork项目上的undertow-scenario，EntryService休眠8秒才响应，缺少operationNames的概率几乎百之百，但是我们将EntryService的超时时间改到30秒或者60秒就可以避免，对于正常的用例没有影响，对于kafka这样特殊的用例能提高稳定性)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/arugal/skywalking/blob/113e0811bb7b091ac7373265cd23dfab4393b386/test/plugin/scenarios/undertow-scenario/config/actualData.yaml#L1-L48","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/546942274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/546953106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/3724#issuecomment-546953106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3724","id":546953106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Njk1MzEwNg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-28T13:46:15Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T13:46:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"First of all, is really kafka consumer requiring 10s?
