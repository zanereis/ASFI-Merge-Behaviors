@andrewor14 I took another pass on this. Things are looking good but a few notes in the code. In a few places it seemed like `Option` was used in a way that causes what are really runtime failures to be ignored. It's better in these cases to actually cause an exception in less there is a legitimate reason the option could be `None`. Otherwise if there are failures they are really hard to understand/debug.\n\nThere are a couple of things in here that I was a bit confused by and we can discuss offline. They were the special case for the BlockManager listener (I still wonder if we can come up with a better solution than is currently there) and the use of redirection for static code.\n\nIn general though this is looking good and I think it's close to being ready to merge.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37776148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37776246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/136#issuecomment-37776246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/136","id":37776246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Nzc2MjQ2","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-17T00:03:15Z","updated_at":"2014-03-17T00:03:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pwendell @mridulm , RDD.sliding is a public method in this PR.

I am not clear a `BinaryClassificationModel` is needed. What it adds, the score method, seems to just return 0/1 depending on the predicted class. The result is already 0/1, or a probability, in which case this adds little. The ROC calculation feels like it does not require a superclass like this just for its own sake.\n\n(Separately: I think there is a design problem here with `ClassificationModel` outputting `Double`. Classifiers output a class, which is an enumerated, opaque value, or a distribution of probabilities over classes, which is a mapping of opaque values to numbers. It so happens that you can map opaque values to 0,1,2. And it so happens these are not only ints but real values. And it so happens that you can map the distribution over 2 classes into a single number in [0,1]. And it so happens that these can all be represented by a `Double`, just like the output of a `RegressionModel`. But it's severe overloading that will cause tears later. But this is a separate issue. A design change along these lines _might_ necessitate a special subclass for binary classifiers, but not sure.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37783918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37783949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/157#issuecomment-37783949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/157","id":37783949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzgzOTQ5","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-17T04:14:12Z","updated_at":"2014-03-17T04:14:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@baishuo I think we'd probably opt to not include this in Spark, but it's helpful to have this as a reference example.

now, the cases where preemptive checking isn't happening are in `DStream.transform` and `DStream.transformWith` invocations, since a `DStream` object is accessible from the closure argument to these in all but one invocation in the test suite (including invocations from `DStream.count`).  \n\nAs far as I can tell, the streaming scheduler just doesn't check for closure serializability at all.  If this is the case, does it make sense to disable preemptive serialization checking on `DStream` and then also disable the check in `DAGScheduler`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37854483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37855043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/161#issuecomment-37855043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/161","id":37855043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODU1MDQz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-17T18:51:00Z","updated_at":"2014-03-17T18:51:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Merged build triggered.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37855043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
