There is a `DeployManager.java` in FE source code. This is a base class for the deployment of Doris for some certain scenarios, such k8s, Ambari. And the derived class `LocalFileDeployManager` is for generic scenarios. I think you may use this to implement the deploy method.\r\n\r\n2. In my opinion, the deployment tools should contains the ability of downloading, distribution, installation and starting. And your scripts only implement the latter two, the downloading and distribution ability is missing.\r\n\r\n3. The expansibility and maintainability should also be considered. For example, what if user wants to add some additional configurations to `fe.conf` or `be.conf`? Is there a convenient way to change the configuration and re-deploy them again? And the latest `start_xx.sh` is added a new parameter `--daemon` instead of the `&` symbol, you'd better redesign the script.\r\n\r\nI think this script is not ready for now. But Doris DO long for a deployment toolset.\r\nAny idea can be discussed here (Using Chinese is also welcome).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/487060005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/487126802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/1045#issuecomment-487126802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/1045","id":487126802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzEyNjgwMg==","user":{"login":"zhoufwind","id":3394857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTQ4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3394857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind","html_url":"https://github.com/zhoufwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhoufwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T16:55:42Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T16:55:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@morningman
