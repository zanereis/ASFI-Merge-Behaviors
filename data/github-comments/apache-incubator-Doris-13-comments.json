@morningman \r\nMaybe default nullable column may confuse users except hadoop users. In many database system, such as kudu, hive, mysql, the default nullable column is a common use case, we get data from hdfs, kafka, which cannot ensure that column data not null, actually, null value for many columns  is very common in production environment. And kudu, parquet, orc file also process with nullable column well. It is also ok for us to mark every non key column nullable explicitly if column not nullable default feature is so much important for doris on scan performance. But the specail design should be noted in the document, because normal users may not think too much when create table, and may load data failed because of data not allowed null default.
