Which versions of Flink will this support? Or is it agnostic to the flink version?\r\n\r\nI will create a backport PR soon, which will add the feature to Flink 1.15, and Flink 1.16 too.\r\nThat said, the next task on my list is #8930, which will enable Flink 1.18 support, but it will also drop 1.15 support.

In other words, is it enough to update the iceberg dependency in the flink application to the newest version (when it is ready), or do we also have to update the iceberg storage code aswell?\r\n\r\nThe only server side of Iceberg is the REST Catalog implementation, which are not affected by this change (and you might use a different Catalog anyway). So Flink dependency upgrade is enough.\r\n\r\n> 3.

I'm going to merge this to keep the fix focused on the procedure output for non-main branches. There are still 2 pending related items: \r\n\r\n1.) Fixing the naming in the replace/fastForward APIs: That PR is here https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/9134/files\r\n2.) The original issue for fast forwarding a branch which does not exist yet (this PR still preserves the original behavior, just with an explicit null check beforehand).https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8849\r\n\r\n For 2, I do agree it's an awkward experience that should be fixed (after all many folks would write to audit first before the existence of main). I noticed that recently there was a `create` added which does add the dummy append. We could maybe stitch together the APIs to achieve the \"create\" if it does not already exist or we could add a new API. The first is preferable IMO but I'd need to check further on the feasibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1824793066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1824802554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/9139#issuecomment-1824802554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/9139","id":1824802554,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85sxEb6","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-23T18:24:12Z","updated_at":"2023-11-23T18:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvary

Sadly these backports were not clean backports, resulting in a slightly different code in v1.17/v1.16/v1.15 versions. #9146 is a standalone commit which cleans up the differences, and makes sure that v1.16/v1.15 has the same code as v1.17. The code in v1.17 was used as a master of the changes.\r\n- #9144 - This has 2 commits. The first one (c7b484e31346aaada75188a23e5e6a70ea4325c3) is the same as #9146, the second one (21b3eea789cda091dad5727d2af91eebd0cfce4b) is the backport of the Flink part of #8803. If we accept this one, we can merge the changes without squashing the commits - this way we have a clean history, but we can move forward faster.\r\n- #9145 - This has 3 commits. The first two are the same as #9144, the third one (27333e399e4a6b6e2618229c79c4cdf4d806ced9) is the backport of #8553. If we accept this one, we can merge the changes without squashing the commits - this way we have a clean history, but we can move forward faster.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to understand better the contents of the actual backport commit of #8553, the 27333e399e4a6b6e2618229c79c4cdf4d806ced9 is a merge of the clean backport (67d5cdc9ce4ae71cc30dc117e9793827cca0ff8c), and the required v1.15 related fixes (c09aab007ce15dce1df05c8df86fefe6e0bcc9f1) which are needed as Flink v1.15 has a missing feature used by the tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1825349863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1825406804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/9129#issuecomment-1825406804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/9129","id":1825406804,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85szX9U","user":{"login":"tomtongue","id":43331405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzMxNDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43331405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue","html_url":"https://github.com/tomtongue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomtongue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-24T09:49:47Z","updated_at":"2023-11-24T09:55:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review again.

You can only guarantee this is safe for your data, for any other user this could be unsafe. That’s the underlying issue with this PR, we are essentially allowing a cast binary as string.Sent from my iPhoneOn Nov 24, 2023, at 4:47 AM, fengjiajie ***@***.***> wrote:﻿ I'm also a little nervous about this change, how are we guaranteed that the binary is parsable as UTF8 bytes? Seems like we should just be fixing the type annotations rather than changing our readers to read files that have been written incorrectly? @RussellSpitzer Hi, can you please tell if this issue can be moved forward? We have a lot of hive tables that contain such parquet files and we are trying to convert these hive tables into iceberg tables, this process of parquet files cannot be rewritten (because of the large number of history files). We can guarantee that it could be parsed in UTF-8 because the data was originally defined as a string in hive. If it wasn't a string before, there's no reason defining it as a string when defining the iceberg table would make it fail to parse. —Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.***>\r\n\r\n@RussellSpitzer Thanks for the reply, but I still don't get it.\r\n\r\n* I don't quite understand why this is 'unsafe' for any other user?\r\n* Also this conversion is only possible if the user defines the iceberg column as a string. A user defining a column as string means that the user wants to use the value of the column as a string (string is required by the iceberg specification to be UTF-8 encoded, and the library decodes it as UTF-8 according to the specification), otherwise, if the user only wants the column to be used as a binary, the user should define the iceberg column as a binary type instead of a string type, and there would be no conversion.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the conversion is based on the fact that the user defines the column as string and wants to use it as a string. If you think there is an inappropriate scenario, could you give an example?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1826731977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1826790324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4549#issuecomment-1826790324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4549","id":1826790324,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85s4pu0","user":{"login":"yakovsushenok","id":60291094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMjkxMDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60291094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok","html_url":"https://github.com/yakovsushenok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yakovsushenok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-26T13:52:48Z","updated_at":"2023-11-26T13:52:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I used iceberg table format v2 and when I was querying with Athena engine 2, I was getting this error.

Or worse, some files do have UTF-8 encoded binary and others do not.\r\n\r\nI think the logic here is straight forward for our users? If your data is not a string than you should not annotate it as a string right? If users define it as a string, it is the users' duty to make sure that the binary is a string.\r\n\r\nAnd about the 'unsafe' problem.\r\n\r\nWIthout the PR here, if users specify a binary data as string, it will just return byte array directly and the upper layer will crash because of type mismatch. And with the PR here, if the data is UTF-8 encoded, we are happy as our code could pass now. If the data is not UTF-8 encoded, we will crash, which is the same result before this PR.\r\n\r\nSo in general, the PR here does not add new crashing scenarios right?\r\n\r\nOr at least, maybe we could introduce a fallback option here?
