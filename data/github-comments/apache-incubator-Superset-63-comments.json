Currently we guarantee that metrics of the same name in a dashboard will be the same color across charts.\r\n\r\nThere's this function/object that cycles through the palette and provide a new color for new expressions and memoizes as it goes. If you ask for `Metric 1` twice it'll give you the same color.\r\n\r\nEarly on I would hash \"Metric 1\" and provide a color based on the hash so that \"Metric 1\" would ALWAYS be the same color. The problem there was that with say 8 colors, you relatively often get in situation where a chart with say 2 or 3 metrics will get the same color twice, and that's no good. A chart with \"Metric 1\" and \"Metric 2\" might have the same color for both 1 out of 8 times...\r\n\r\nSomeone in the community said they pre-populate that memoized object with an array of all their important metrics. \r\n\r\nFor reference:\r\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/superset/blob/master/superset/assets/javascripts/modules/colors.js#L51\r\n\r\nSomehow f you call `category21` for an array of metrics, before you render the dashboard, colors for these metrics will be deterministic.

I will explain my real use case which is also a classic example, and I hope this gives more clarity on the issue.\r\n\r\n> I have a global revenue dashboard which only CXOs should see. But we also need to have region specific dashboards (like APAC, US, EMEA) which respective region heads need to see for:\r\n>    1. Business Reasons - Not everyone should have access to company level data\r\n>    2. User Experience - APAC head will be interested only in APAC. S/he should not be clicking and be filtering multiple times to see her/his region numbers.\r\n\r\n**The problem I am facing to implement the above:**\r\nI can create different slices and dashboards per region, but I am not able to restrict the user at dashboard level. I tried to duplicate the data source (as I can apply access control at data source level) but Superset doesn't allow that (error pasted below). A particular database and table (in my case a simple MySql DB) cannot be configured twice. Even if this is allowed (with an alias or something equivalent or by removing the unique constraint), then it will solve my above use case as I can restrict the data at query level itself. OR if permission can be created for every dashboard, then it will simpler as I don't have to duplicate the data source and it will be more intuitive from role management perspective.\r\n\r\n`(raised
