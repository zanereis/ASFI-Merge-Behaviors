If not, the write batch would fail.\r\n\r\nThe scenario I described does not happen when I have a missing column but no new column in the same batch. Then Hudi injects null to the missing column and the column is not removed from the table in metastore.\r\n\r\nThe behavior I'm looking for is like this:\r\nincoming data doesn’t contain every column in the table –> those columns will simply be assigned null/default values\r\nThis is what other similar frameworks allow users to do, so I guess Hudi can do the same possibly as an option guarded by a config if someone prefers to enforce schema more strictly.\r\n\r\nI also found a comment from another Hudi issue, that makes me think that my scenario should work:\r\n\r\n> @TarunMootala can you upgrade Hudi to 0.10.1. this can reconcile the schema wherever the new field is put in.

Sorry, I am not following completely. The file system view during inflight commit (i.e. `20220617091358406.inflight`) after cleaning (i.e `20220617091348754.clean`) should have 3 instants: `20220617091324896.commit, 20220617091336735.commit, 20220617091341327.commit`? Are you suggesting that you see only the first two commits and not the third one? Ideally this should not happen because for each commit file system view is instantiated with visible commits. Is it possible due to race that cleaning completed before `20220617091341327.commit`/\r\n\r\nYes, as you understand. When I debug in  `AbstractTableFileSystemView.addFilesToView` , At moments `20220617091341327` and `20220617091358406 `  The value of parameter \r\n `visibleCommitsAndCompactionTimeline`  has only the first two but no third.
