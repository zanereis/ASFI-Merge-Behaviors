typing the stuff below and then found it was probably the same as this issue.\r\nBelow are my findings, which might help someone else to see if there can be done something to make this work.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to the work already done for #1229 and #1627 .\r\nWhat we are trying to do is the following:\r\nWe have build up a Kubernetes cluster where we run the openzipkin/zipkin service and an ingress controller to reach various services like Kibana, Grafana, ElasticSearch and also zipkin.\r\n\r\nThe ingress controller looks a follows:\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\r\nkind: Ingress\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: cbo-ingress-mgmt-elb\r\n  namespace: monitoring\r\n  labels:\r\n    app: ingressservice-mgmt-elb\r\n    dns: route53\r\n  annotations:\r\n    # kubernetes.io/tls-acme: \"true\"\r\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\"\r\n    ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /\r\n    ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: \"false\"\r\n    domainName: \"mgmt.$DOMAIN\"\r\nspec:\r\n  rules:\r\n  - host: management.${CNF_ENV}.cbo\r\n    http:\r\n      paths:\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: alertmanager\r\n          servicePort: 9093\r\n        path: /alertmanager\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: elasticsearch\r\n          servicePort: 9200\r\n        path: /elasticsearch\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: grafana\r\n          servicePort: 3000\r\n        path: /grafana\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: kibana\r\n          servicePort: 5601\r\n        path: /kibana\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: prometheus-monitoring\r\n          servicePort: 9090\r\n        path: /prometheus\r\n      - backend:\r\n          serviceName: zipkin-service\r\n          servicePort: 9411\r\n        path: /zipkin\r\n```\r\nSo for example, the Kibana service is now reachable via: http://management.test.cbo/kibana.\r\nKibana will then forward the browser to http://management.test.cbo/kibana/app/kibana\r\nKibana is configured with a SERVER_BASEPATH environment variable with value: \"/kibana\" and that works.\r\n\r\nIf we now go to http://management.test.cbo/zipkin then zipkin will forward the browser to http://management.test.cbo/zipkin/zipkin/ and you get a broken UI with the page only showing two links.\r\n```html\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n--\r\n  | <html>\r\n  | <head>\r\n  | <!--\r\n  | add 'base' tag to work around the fact that 'html-webpack-plugin' does not work\r\n  | with

type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"app-50c2a6865887222f5166.min.js\"></script></body>\r\n  | </html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the generated nginx.conf from the ingress controller, we find that `ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /` adds the following two redirects:\r\n```\r\nrewrite /zipkin/(.*) /$1 break;\r\nrewrite /zipkin / break;\r\nproxy_pass http://monitoring-zipkin-service-9411;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe created a simple nginx docker container:\r\n```Docker\r\nFROM nginx:latest\r\n\r\nCOPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the nginx.conf:\r\n```\r\nworker_processes 1;\r\n\r\nevents { worker_connections 1024; }\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp {\r\n\r\n    log_format compression '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '\r\n        '\"$request\" $status $upstream_addr '\r\n        '\"$http_referer\" \"$http_user_agent\" \"$gzip_ratio\"';\r\n\r\n    server {\r\n        listen 8080;\r\n        server_name reverse-proxy;\r\n        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log compression;\r\n\r\n        location /zipkin {\r\n            proxy_pass          http://docker.for.mac.localhost:32786;\r\n            proxy_set_header    Host             $host;\r\n            proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;\r\n            proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\r\n            proxy_read_timeout 1800;\r\n            proxy_connect_timeout 1800;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhere port 32768 is mapped on the openzipkin/zipkin container 9411 port. The /etc/hosts file contains \r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1 reverse-proxy\r\n127.0.0.1 zipkin-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we go to http://reverse-proxy:8080/zipkin then the UI works.\r\nIf we now add the two extra rewrite rules, the UI breaks by going to /zipkin/zipkin/\r\nI tried setting the SERVER_CONTEXT_PATH but that didn't do anything.\r\n\r\nSo this narrows it down to the ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / setting, which does not work for zipkin. Since we have many services in the same namespace and domain, we are going to see if we can move zipkin out to its own configuration section where we can set the rewrite-target to /zipkin and see if that works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/358905641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/359120484","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1884#issuecomment-359120484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1884","id":359120484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTEyMDQ4NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T23:43:40Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T23:43:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Haha if you have a trace with 9k spans you will have other problems.\n\nIn any case better to profile the concern and check what the impact is.\n\nAt some point the native format will be v2 which means this conversion will\nnot happen so it is temporary.\n\nOn 20 Jan 2018 6:55 am, \"Logic-32\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> *@Logic-32* commented on this pull request.\n> ------------------------------\n>\n> In zipkin-ui/js/component_ui/uploadTrace.js\n> <https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1884#discussion_r162752141>:\n>\n> > +import {component} from 'flightjs';\n> +import FullPageSpinnerUI from '../component_ui/fullPageSpinner';\n> +import traceToMustache from '../../js/component_ui/traceToMustache';\n> +\n> +export default component(function uploadTrace() {\n> +  this.doUpload = function() {\n> +    const files = this.node.files;\n> +    if (files.length === 0) {\n> +      return;\n> +    }\n> +\n> +    const reader = new FileReader();\n> +    reader.onload = evt => {\n> +      let model;\n> +      try {\n> +        const trace = JSON.parse(evt.target.result);\n>\n> Are you suggesting that we iterate through the spans in trace, see if\n> they have a 'localEndpoint', and if they do, then call\n> jsonEncoder.encodeV1() (effectively) on each span so that the UI can\n> display both v1 and v2 traces?\n>\n> I'm midly afraid that v2 traces with 9k spans will suffer a bit from that.\n> But that concern aside, is there an easy way to extract jsonEncoder without\n> having to copy/paste it into zipkin-ui?
