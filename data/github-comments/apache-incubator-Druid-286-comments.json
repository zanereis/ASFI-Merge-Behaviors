The current idea seems to be that there will be a property named \"evictionCost\" within a pod's status object. This will help feeding back preferences about which pod of a deployment to kill for a scale-down operation to kubernetes\r\n* the current workaround that is known to the community which is the least hacky indeed seems to be to use Kubernetes Jobs.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the autoscaling mechanism in Druid to be tied to AWS EC2:\r\n* we wrote an autoscaler for Druid which delegates the execution of provision/terminate/ip2idLookup/id2ipLookup to an external REST endpoint. This is more lightweight than having the platform-specific code sitting inside of a Druid extension which makes it slow/difficult to make quick adjustments. We are willing to contribute this.\r\n* we are currently working towards another contribution that improves the autoscaling mechanism in Druid to support different tiers of middlemanagers. ( #8695 )\r\nThis feature proposal will soon receive a code contribution and we will also update the description of the proposal. It seems to me that in general, one should either make sure that the approach in the scope of this proposal should either be aligned with the existing concept of the autoscaling extension-point in Druid or the current autoscaling mechanism in Druid should be clearly marked as deprecated so that the community can align well on working on future-safe contributions.\r\n\r\nOpen points I did not think too much about yet:\r\n* how would volume management work in the case of many autoscaled peon/indexer pods\r\n* how to design this approach such that it integrates well with the peer project that works towards a Druid operator for k8s\r\n* how to handle task failover in cases Kubernetes relocates pods to free up physical nodes. Such compactions happen and statefulsets/deployments deal well with such planned operational disruptions via PodDisruptionBudgets and via the internal controller logic of deployments/statefulsets. I don't recall the specifics of k8s Jobs in this context, but it seems that one needs to think explicitly about how to handle such cases. Jobs don't get restarted indefinately often in response to a pod relocation and task failover would need to be supported for native batch tasks such that such planned disruptions would not make a whole multi-task batch ingestion task fail.\r\n\r\nBy the way: would it make sense if this proposal were to target only Druid's new ingestion pipeline consisting of the Druid indexer and native ingestion tasks such as index_parallel etc. or would it be required to support different modes like middlemanager mode vs. indexer mode.\r\nI would certainly hope that the new native indexing mechanism would be supported along with the new indexer. Not sure though whether it is necessary to also support the middlemanager/peon lane as well. What do you think?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/558787375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/558806226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8931#issuecomment-558806226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8931","id":558806226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODgwNjIyNg==","user":{"login":"a2l007","id":4603202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDMyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4603202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007","html_url":"https://github.com/a2l007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T20:34:39Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T20:34:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jon-wei Does this approach sound reasonable?

But it might be better to just override `isUserPermitted` in `DruidAvaticaHandler` and this would call a new method say `authenticateJDBCRequest(HttpServletRequest clientRequest)` in the Authenticator. The auth result can then be pushed to the request context that can be used for authorization later on. So the end user would only have to implement a new method within their existing authenticators which would handle the jdbc requests. \r\n`authenticateJDBCRequest` can eventually replace `authenticateJDBCContext` since it would be possible to extract the context from the request itself.\r\nPlease let me know if you feel there is a better way to do this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/559602894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/559619196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8969#issuecomment-559619196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8969","id":559619196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTYxOTE5Ng==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-28T23:33:20Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T23:33:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"TC errors are unrelated, merging","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/559619196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/559666376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8748#issuecomment-559666376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8748","id":559666376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTY2NjM3Ng==","user":{"login":"dkhwangbo","id":13585249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTg1MjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13585249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo","html_url":"https://github.com/dkhwangbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhwangbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T05:42:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T05:42:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SEKIRO-J @ccaominh \r\nHi.

Pardon me if this is vague, but I see the following code is using: `if (!matcher.matches()) {}` in [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/parsers/RegexParser.java#L93) is used for matching entire text.\r\n\r\nI feel that beats the purpose of Regex parser, where if the pattern does not match until the entire text is matched as a whole. I was of the opinion it would best fit the use cases, where we use: `while (matcher.find()) {}`, thus providing us with the ability to write regex with more flexibilities.\r\n\r\nWith `matcher.find()` it's easier to replicate a regex pattern find and group. Adding a regex to match an entire string as is always ends up with using a global filter like `(.*)`.

this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/560933539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/560948816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8979#issuecomment-560948816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8979","id":560948816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDk0ODgxNg==","user":{"login":"ccaominh","id":9208416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9208416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh","html_url":"https://github.com/ccaominh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccaominh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-03T00:56:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T00:56:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Yes, this is one of the issues of the time chunk lock. With the time chunk lock, the task acquires locks for the time chunks where new segments are going to be created. These locks are not released until the task is complete. I think this is to simplify the task lock system especially to avoid deadlocks (like, two tasks could wait each other to lock time chunks what the other task is holding). \r\n\r\nThis problem can be avoided with the new segment lock system which was introduced in 0.16. Check https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/tasks.html#task-lock-system for more details. Also please note that this is still an experimental feature.
