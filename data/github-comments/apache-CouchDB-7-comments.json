Two things need to be done to make it usable. I've added the `session.trigger(\"authenticated\");` so that  we can check the config only once the user has logged in. Could you add that in.\n\nThe second fix is when a user creates a new view. If a user creates a view for an existing design doc, then they cannot choose the language for the new view but must use the language that the design doc is set as (unless the design doc is empty, then they can choose which language to write the new view in). If a user selects a new design doc then the language option should appear and they can then choose what language this design doc is written in.\n\nOnce those two are implemented we should be ready to merge this in.

Let's update the \"View JSON\" class from btn-large to btn-small. \n3. when a JSON view is expanded, let's toggle the View JSON button to Close JSON. Make the close a gray button.\n4. Clipboard icon on the right. Works great for me, but the icon could be better. @deathbearbrown in the Cloudant Dash PR #150, I provided a clipboard icon that might be useful here.

colorblindness  \nWhen you do zebra striping it's better to do it by value than color  (IE: dark and light)  People can differentiate that better than by color.  Those particular red/blue hexes are the same value.  So if you can't see color, you'll see the same grey. \n\nI like art stuff, and wanted to comment because I happen to know about this stuff. >.>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/40369711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/40401430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/206#issuecomment-40401430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/206","id":40401430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDAxNDMw","user":{"login":"robertkowalski","id":298166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski","html_url":"https://github.com/robertkowalski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertkowalski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-14T18:32:27Z","updated_at":"2014-04-14T18:32:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Good catch! \n\nCan your take a second look as I removed the opacity as the selector matched again.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/40401430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/40401935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/204#issuecomment-40401935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/204","id":40401935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDAxOTM1","user":{"login":"deathbearbrown","id":607541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/607541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/deathbearbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathbearbrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-14T18:36:37Z","updated_at":"2014-04-14T18:36:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok I checked this out and looked at it.
