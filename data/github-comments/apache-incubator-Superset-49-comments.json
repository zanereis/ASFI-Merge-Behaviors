I was obviously a bit confused what you were trying to get at earlier. \r\n\r\nI think `UrlTestCase` is fine for making sure bookmarks survive.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that the approach in `PrefixUrlTests` would actually stop anyone adding hard coded urls without a lot of work. All urls that are exposed in `views.py` with `@expose` will by default work under a prefix. The problem are links to static files and other resources in the rendered pages as well as redirects within the app itself. \r\n\r\nTo catch hard coded urls in those cases, there has to be tests in place that asserts that generated urls have the proper prefix. In addition, all redirects have to be tested. \r\n\r\nBy having the current tests run under a prefix it is possible to at least test a lot of the redirects, but I have no idea how the coverage looks like. I don't think there are many tests that look at hrefs in the templates.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm seeing two main routes here: \r\n1. Just add the `UrlTestCase` with important urls to make sure I didn't screw something up. No changes to tests to make them work under a prefix. Add documentation to make everyone use `url_for` instead of hard coded urls.\r\n2. Add the `PrefixUrlTests` that really probe for use of hardcoded urls. Document the practice of filling up the `PrefixUrlTests` with more tests as urls and/or behavior are changed/added. \r\n\r\nI'm fine with 1. It will mean there will be the occasional hard coded url slipping in, but it should be easy to patch when it happens. The few of us that need to be able to run superset under a prefix just has to be a bit careful with the upgrades

With this new code you can look at the `metrics` config array and know the correspondence of which component will be called, exactly which props will be passed, and which props will be evaluated from state.\r\n\r\nWithout that simplicity, someone might look for the virtual fields in the components folder and not find them, have to grep to find the logic and understand the props association. I also want to prevent more logic from slipping into that layer as things are already pretty hard to follow already when simplified.\r\n\r\nIf that config gets outs of control in the future, we may want to revisit the idea of \"virtual field\" associated with predefined sets of props, but for now I'd rather have something simple and explicit. If we were to add this logic is should be generic and live close to the `metrics` array, not in `FieldSet.js`.\r\n\r\nAlso the reason why they were there in the first place was legacy reasons,
