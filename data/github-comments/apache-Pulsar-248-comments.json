@liudezhi2098 , thanks for your work on this. I'm trying to understand how I'd advise users regarding how to implement this feature. \r\nThe docs provide this example:\r\n\r\nhttps://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-messaging/#retry-letter-topic\r\n\r\n```\r\nConsumer<byte[]> consumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.BYTES)\r\n                .topic(topic)\r\n                .subscriptionName(\"my-subscription\")\r\n                .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Shared)\r\n                .enableRetry(true)\r\n                .receiverQueueSize(100)\r\n                .deadLetterPolicy(DeadLetterPolicy.builder()\r\n                        .maxRedeliverCount(maxRedeliveryCount)\r\n                        .retryLetterTopic(\"persistent://my-property/my-ns/my-subscription-custom-Retry\")\r\n                        .build())\r\n                .subscriptionInitialPosition(SubscriptionInitialPosition.Earliest)\r\n                .subscribe();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not clear where they'd set the delay between retries. Could you please clarify this? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/696321076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/696364483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8084#issuecomment-696364483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8084","id":696364483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjM2NDQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"alexku7","id":42849762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQ5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42849762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7","html_url":"https://github.com/alexku7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexku7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T20:43:51Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T20:51:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tabalt  @sijie \r\nI am prety sure that this is the same issue like this https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8024 (our issue:) )\r\nit has been fixed but not still released.\r\n\r\n@sijie  I think this bug so much severe that it worth to release 2.6.2 version and not to wait for 2.7 :) for you consideration ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/696364483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/696366103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8084#issuecomment-696366103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8084","id":696366103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjM2NjEwMw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T20:46:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T20:46:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@alexku7 the issue has been labeled for 2.6.2 release.

@codelipenghui , thanks for your reply. I have tried ReconsumeLater feature, but it does not meet our requirements, like I said in my original post,\r\n\r\n\r\n> Second Attempt\r\nWe use Pulsar ReCosume logic, but still cannot meet our requirement because every time we ReCosume a message, it actually generate a new message, when the worker finishes/fails the original message, it has no info about the new message.\r\nWe could do some workaround here, e.g. when the consumer dispatches the original message, it first ReConsume it, generating a new Message, then dispatches the new message to the worker.
