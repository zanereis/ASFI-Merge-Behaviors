Please review and consider going furhter.\n\nAs far as GridCacheRebalancingAggregationTest - it obviously has a bug. If on some random iteration update thread throws exception, test does not fail. This should fail the test for sure.\n\nAs a general note I would say that when you dealing with restart/failover tests one thread doing updates is not enough. You should send massive and variable load to your tests topology from multiple threads prefferrably having contended keys between them.\n\nI would aslo encourage you to take a look at our current failover threads.

We find that this type of test can uncover unusual/unintended behaviours. \n\n IgniteCacheCrossCacheTxFailoverTest and GridCacheTxNodeFailureSelfTest don't override `GridAbstractTest.isMultiJvm()` to start external processes for testing, and GridAbstractTest doesn't currently have the ability to kill nodes - this ability was added in GridRollingRestartAbstractTest#stopGrid(int idx)\n\nIf these new tests we're adding are duplicating the existing failover tests, perhaps I could modify the existing tests so they start nodes as separate processes and randomly stop nodes with `kill -9` instead of a graceful `stop` callable? Or perhaps I can keep these as a distinct type of failover test, and I will try to reuse the existing tests - simply run them in the context of a grid undergoing \"RollingRestart\" (which is achieved by subclassing GridRollingRestartAbstractTest).\n\nLet me know what you think would be the best way to get test coverage in this area (whether by reusing GridRollingRestartAbstractTest, or modifying the existing failover tests to allow them to be run while a rolling restart is in progress).

@yzhdanov , I've merged your review feedback into the branch. I added code to ensure the update thread logs any exceptions and also the test checks that the thread exited without encountering an exception. \n\nIf the updateThread exited, either `while (restartThread.isAlive());` or an exception occurred, so the test that `assertEquals(getMaxRestarts(), restartThread.getRestartTotal());` was trying to ensure that updateThread exited due to restartThread/test finishing, rather than an exception - but I've made it test explicitly that the updateThread hasn't encountered an exception - it's much cleaner/clearer this way, thanks for questioning it. \n\nCheers\nJohn\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/252892528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/255183027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/1011#issuecomment-255183027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/1011","id":255183027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTE4MzAyNw==","user":{"login":"hagmonk","id":13660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk","html_url":"https://github.com/hagmonk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagmonk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T18:07:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T18:07:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Posted this in the Jira too, but just in case it's lost there: what's the update on this issue?

Please specify where exactly you found those.**\n2. JdbcPreparedStatement.executeBatch must throw unsupported exception\n   **Done, removed tests as well.**\n3. JdbcPreparedStatement.ensureArgsSize: if we know exact number of parameters from getNativeStatement(), then we have to check parameter index here.\n   **We don't know exact number of params here - PreparedStatement interface does not give that number and H2 library is not among dependencies of ignite-core, therefore we can't cast to H2's JdbcPreparedStatement either.**\n4.

JdbcStatement.updateCounterFromQueryResult and updateCnt always use long internally, convert to int if public API needs int.\n   **Done.**\n6.
