 -> i understand being busy. I am quite busy myself now so I move it in a slower pace than I would like to (the remainig tests and kubernetes parts). \r\n\r\nAnswering the mysql part -> we are only installing client libraries for mysql not the server ones. Our python mysql library(https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/)  requires mysql-client and libmysqlclient-dev native libraries to be installed. Since we are using debian-stretch as a base (this is what official python images use as a base), default mysql libraries are actually mariadb ones not the \"oracle mysql\" ones. They are supposed to be compatible (mariadb is fork of mysql).\r\n\r\nI figured that Airflow's target is the original \"MySQL\" rather than \"MariaDB\" so I think using \"official\" libs from Oracle might be better choice for CI build - that's why we have separate step to install Oracle libs (following official instructions). It's a bit long because you need to install Oracle Keys and set-up repos, but it boils down to:\r\n\r\n`apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev\r\n`\r\n\r\nNote that Ubuntu has Oracle MySQL installed by default rather than MariaDB, so I guess most of airflow users will also have the MySQL client rather than MariaDB.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/479432212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/479433417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938#issuecomment-479433417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4938","id":479433417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTQzMzQxNw==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T10:32:53Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T10:32:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For the record I am 100% okay using the MariaDB client libs in this image.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/479433417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/479438136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938#issuecomment-479438136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4938","id":479438136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTQzODEzNg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T10:48:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T10:48:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cool.

I'm sure everyone has a lot to do, especially on this awesome product which is Airflow! But some constructive feedback on this PR (as well on the related issue) would be tremendously appreciated... \r\n\r\n_About the need:_ Supporting nested template fields rendering in Operators would be really helpful to better design our DAGs. And it could also probably help other users. Of course, the Airflow team might have some good reason to decide this feature won't be supported. In such a case, we could first have a discussion about the need, and then have a clear explanation why this feature could not be supported. \r\n\r\n_About the PR:_ IMHO, the solution reached with @bjoernpollex-sc 's help is solving most of the use cases. Of course, there might be a better solution.

Would you like to describe them?\r\nReference: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4242","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/480087572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/480097723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5032#issuecomment-480097723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5032","id":480097723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDA5NzcyMw==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T23:24:15Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T23:24:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"there is already a trigger_rule=`all_done` which does the same thing i.e. runs if all the task are completed (passed or failed)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/480097723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/480097973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4980#issuecomment-480097973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4980","id":480097973,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDA5Nzk3Mw==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T23:25:34Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T23:25:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the CI is failing @mik-laj ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/480097973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/480098799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4980#issuecomment-480098799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4980","id":480098799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDA5ODc5OQ==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T23:29:35Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T23:29:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kaxil Thanks.
