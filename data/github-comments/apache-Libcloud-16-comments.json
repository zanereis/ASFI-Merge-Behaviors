Thats why, in a recent change, I punted on providing new arguments for things like local SSD and instead just allowed for a generic JSON/python argument `ex_disks_gce_struct`.  The idea obviously is to let the programmer specify anything here that the upstream GCE API accepts for disks.\n\nI can understand philosophically in wanting new params for local ssd and disk size, but it's not strictly necessary, correct?\n\nAlso, if we go with this pull-request, I'd like to see tests (and rigorous ones) that ensure backwards compatibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/88907955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/88931026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/496#issuecomment-88931026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/496","id":88931026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4OTMxMDI2","user":{"login":"phildav","id":9851757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTE3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9851757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav","html_url":"https://github.com/phildav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phildav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-02T14:37:03Z","updated_at":"2015-04-02T14:37:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @erjohnso , thank you for the quick reply.\nThe reason why I added this into libcloud is that I'm using salt cloud, and it's not aware of `ex_disks_gce_struct`.

We just want to update the `marker` query string parameter which will result in us retrieving results from the next page and eventually when we are on the last page either one of the following termination conditions should be reached:\n- No content status code is returned.\n- There are no more objects on the last page.\n\nHaving said that, there might actually be a bug in how we handle the last page. I will look into trying to reproduce that case (multiple pages, last page has >= 1 objects).\n\nIt would also help if you can gist the output of running your code which results in an infinite loop using `LIBCLOUD_DEBUG`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/98422982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/98423057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/507#issuecomment-98423057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/507","id":98423057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NDIzMDU3","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-03T01:03:57Z","updated_at":"2015-05-03T01:03:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry for the delay and thanks.

that is why thee CRC exists in the first place - to make sure the data is intact and not corrupted.\n\nIf it was an issue with a library, it would fail all of the time, not just some times. It could be a some kind of network issue on your or CloudSigma's side, a loadbalancer at CloudSigma corrupting the response or something else in the middle causing this issue to happen.\n\nOnly thing I find weird is that using zlib doesn't cause this issue to happen.
