I'd rather support only a subset of the charts in the \"visualize flow\" and make sure that we fill in the values needed for the controls for them to render properly as you land. \r\n\r\nYour approach in building the dropdown is better though. Can you add a `.filter()` that specifies a subset of the vizTypes?\r\n\r\nSome of the controls like `metrics` will have pick a default value, but some required ones won't. Eventually we should make sure that all required field get a decent default so that the visualize flow always works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/320287037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/320287418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3067#issuecomment-320287418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3067","id":320287418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDI4NzQxOA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T16:03:54Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T16:03:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch need to rebase again?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/320287418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/320288180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3237#issuecomment-320288180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3237","id":320288180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDI4ODE4MA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T16:07:12Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T16:07:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for the fix!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/320288180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/320289818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/3242#issuecomment-320289818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3242","id":320289818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDI4OTgxOA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T16:14:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T16:14:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Glad to see you're working on this.
