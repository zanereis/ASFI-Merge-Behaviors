A decision on whether we should hold strict backcompat for the v1 LISTSNAPSHOT response format, or go with the (clearly preferable) syntax the v2 API has currently.  I opened a dev@ thread about that, which slows this PR down a bit, but it's better to get consensus on this rather than risk someone complaining later.  If there's no objections by mid-next week I say we go forward with the improved syntax.\r\n2. Handling of the async param.

It sounds like a good way to get familiar with other APIs in Solr.\r\n3. I added three tests just checking the errors response from CoreSnapshotAPI. I started to write some tests (heavily mocked) to verify valid response output, but ran into an issue where I couldn't mock the IndexDeletionPolicyWrapper since its a final class.

(pending)\r\n2. I created a new CoreAdminAPIBase class to house the async handling code. The class takes the async code from CoreAdminHandler and wraps it in handle method. The handle method then takes it some parameters from each endpoint along with a Supplier<T extends JerseyResponse>. This appears to work the same as the original V1 APIs async code. However, injecting a SolrQueryRequest and SolrQueryResponse has led to a MultiException stack error. See below for the output. I did some digging through the CoreContainer code and through code that bound InjectionFactories to the jerseyAppHandler, but nothing stuck out to me. Any thoughts?\r\n3. I figured out a way to write the response validation tests without needing to mock. It turns out everything I needed was already in the Test's base class.

hold off on merging this for now based on Houston's comment above...\r\n\r\n> can we take /commands out of the path for this? /replace alone is pretty self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nSelf-explanatory, sure.  But there are other concerns beyond self-explanatory-ness.  In particular:\r\n\r\n1. **Consistency** Most of the proposed v2 APIs are designed around this pattern of `/pluralGroupName/singleInstance` (e.g. `/collections/techproducts`, `/shards/shard1`, `/fields/text`.)  The `/commands` path segment helps us stay consistent with that pattern.\r\n2. **Uniqueness/Ambiguity** It's less of an issue with this API in particular, but `/commands` is necessary on other paths to prevent collision or ambiguity between paths.  e.g. `/api/cores/commands/swap` is unambiguous, but `/api/cores/swap` could either be an attempt to swap two cores, or an attempt to fetch the status of a core called 'swap'.\r\n\r\nAnyway - if you don't find either of those convincing @HoustonPutman (or @dsmiley ) then we can change the design of this and other APIs to drop that path segment.  But I figured I'd chime in to make a last defense of it, in case any of those other benefits were non-obvious.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1305636871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1305755994","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1115#issuecomment-1305755994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1115","id":1305755994,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5N1EFa","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T15:10:22Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T15:10:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 1. **Consistency** Most of the proposed v2 APIs are designed around this pattern of `/pluralGroupName/singleInstance` (e.g. `/collections/techproducts`, `/shards/shard1`, `/fields/text`.)  The `/commands` path segment helps us stay consistent with that pattern.\r\n\r\nBut given your example (`http://localhost:8983/api/cluster/nodes/localhost:7574_solr/commands/replace/`) the `nodes/SingleNode` is already there, so we are still following this consistency. \r\n\r\nMaybe the docs in the PR are out of date, but the uniqueness thing is also not an issue because the node name is already in the URL. I understand how the `cores/commands/swap` example makes sense (though it can probably use the same syntax here with `cores/core_name/swap`...), but I think in general its best that we try to leave out `commands` and other filler paths when we can 🙂 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1305755994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1305947078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1115#issuecomment-1305947078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1115","id":1305947078,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5N1yvG","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T17:26:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T17:41:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> the `nodes/SingleNode` is already there, so we are still following this consistency.\r\n\r\nDoing it for nodes and not commands is the definition of inconsistency though, isn't it?  😛  The idea isn't to do this just for collections, or once-per-path maybe and call it a day.  It's to stick to the pattern everywhere we expose a noun or resource in our API paths.\r\n\r\nIdeally, being consistent on that will help users remember or reason-out what an API will likely be for some operation they're unfamiliar with.  If a user is familiar with other APIs and has seen Solr use such-and-such a pattern for nodes, collections, cores, shards, replicas, replica properties, cluster properties, fields, fieldTypes, requestHandlers, and on and on .... well then they'll probably expect something similar here and it risks coming off as jarring or unintuitive or whatever.\r\n\r\nIMO, the question shouldn't be whether we can get by without this in the path.  The question should be: what benefit do we get from dropping it that offsets the loss in consistency?\r\n\r\nAt least, that's how I see it.  Though it's hard to argue with results in practice - if several of you guys find it unintuitive (as seems to be the case) then maybe dying on the consistency hill isn't the right call here and I'm fine if we remove it.  Just figured I'd give it one last explanation in case that facet wasn't clear, and in hopes of prompting a little more explanation on why you think we'd be better off without it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1305947078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1306319420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1161#issuecomment-1306319420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1161","id":1306319420,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5N3No8","user":{"login":"joel-bernstein","id":5747955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDc5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5747955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-bernstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-bernstein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T22:34:22Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T22:34:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, so it sounds a change entry is needed.

I think that is okay... in the future if we want to get to a UI that does more handholding on the highlighting params we can do that seperately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1310227914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1310585796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1115#issuecomment-1310585796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1115","id":1310585796,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5OHfPE","user":{"login":"joshgog","id":114599057,"node_id":"U_kgDOBtSkkQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114599057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog","html_url":"https://github.com/joshgog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshgog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T16:47:11Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T16:47:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1310585796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1310599921","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1053#issuecomment-1310599921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1053","id":1310599921,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5OHirx","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T16:57:30Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T16:58:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Maybe the code in CollectionsHandler for a given V1 API should actually move to the *API class\r\n\r\nInteresting idea, and it would have a really nice side-effect: it would make it much much easier to unit test the v1 code's invocation of the v2 code.
