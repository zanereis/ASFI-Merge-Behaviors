I suggest we could work on this first with a prototype. \r\n1. Add a new module in collector, named `zipkin-data-receiver`. @peng-yongsheng Do you agree or object? \r\n1. Provide a Jetty based HTTP service to receive these spans. I think the zipkin SDKs will send these to collector separately. Right?\r\n1. Create a in-memory buffer to receive all spans.\r\n1. Trigger trace finished when received the first span (in A), when find the span of trace has no `parentId`. In finish process, make all spans in a list, based on zipkin module.\r\n\r\nFor these steps, I suggest you submit pull request for each one, for making review easier.\r\n\r\nFor the concerns you may have:\r\n- How to process collector cluster?\r\nNo, we don't consider that in the prototype building stage.\r\n- How to process MQ trace?\r\nI will talk with you about this, later. Don't want to make the prototype too complex.\r\n\r\nAnd for @adriancole , do zipkin have provided grpc or protobuf format already(released)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/386514348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/386516811","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1163#issuecomment-386516811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1163","id":386516811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjUxNjgxMQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-04T06:39:39Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T06:39:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
