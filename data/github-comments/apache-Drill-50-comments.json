The only modification I would have to make is to check if the sqlKind belongs to the `SqlKind.QUERY` collection to decide if the query can be wrapped. So, far, the following queries worked with this check:\r\n```sql\r\n--SqlKind: WITH\r\nwith X1 (r_regionkey, r_name, n_nationkey, n_name) as \r\n  (select r.r_regionkey as r_regionkey, r.r_name as r_name, n.n_nationkey as n_nationkey, n.n_name as n_name from dfs.par100.region r, dfs.par100.nation n where r.r_regionkey=n.n_regionkey)\r\n select X1.n_name as nation, X1.r_name as region, count(*) as tally \r\n  from X1, dfs.par100.customer c \r\n  where X1.n_nationkey = c.c_nationkey\r\n  group by X1.n_name, X1.r_name\r\n  order by tally\r\n\r\n--SqlKind: ORDER_BY \r\nselect r.r_name as region, n.n_name as nation\r\n , count(*) as tally \r\n  from dfs.par100.region r, dfs.par100.nation n \r\n  where r.r_regionkey=n.n_regionkey\r\n  group by n.n_name, r.r_name\r\n  order by tally\r\n\r\n-- SqlKind: UNION \r\nselect r_name as name, r_regionkey as code from dfs.par100.region\r\nUNION\r\nselect n_name as name, n_nationkey as code from dfs.par100.nation \r\n\r\n-- Simple Join\r\nselect r.r_regionkey as r_regionkey, r.r_name as r_name, n.n_nationkey as n_nationkey, n.n_name as n_name from dfs.par100.region r, dfs.par100.nation n where r.r_regionkey=n.n_regionkey\r\n\r\n-- Simple Join with existing Limit 11 less than autolimit value of 13. Results were limited to 11\r\nselect r.r_regionkey as r_regionkey, r.r_name as r_name, n.n_nationkey as n_nationkey, n.n_name as n_name from dfs.par100.region r, dfs.par100.nation n where r.r_regionkey=n.n_regionkey limit 11\r\n\r\n-- Simple Join with existing Limit 22 exceeding autolimit value of 13. Results were limited to 13\r\nselect r.r_regionkey as r_regionkey, r.r_name as r_name, n.n_nationkey as n_nationkey, n.n_name as n_name from dfs.par100.region r, dfs.par100.nation n where r.r_regionkey=n.n_regionkey limit 22\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will be adding a new commit that incorporates most of your review comments except for the `applyAutoLimit()` method and will continue in favor of `wrapWithAutoLimit()` with a check for `SqlKind` property of the `SqlNode`. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/459920386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/459930919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1608#issuecomment-459930919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1608","id":459930919,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTkzMDkxOQ==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T03:24:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T03:24:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ihuzenko please review the latest changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/459930919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/459954849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1524#issuecomment-459954849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1524","id":459954849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk1NDg0OQ==","user":{"login":"ihuzenko","id":4282630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ihuzenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ihuzenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T10:40:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T10:40:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hello @vvysotskyi and  @lushuifeng .

Why do we need a separate RM config file? Why can't this just be part of the existing Drill config file?

The new framework defines them as required VARCHAR. One can argue that the required mode is a) more correct, and b) more efficient.\r\n\r\nScope: The CSV reader today does not define the partition columns for a class-path reader. Their type is nullable INT if used (because they are undefined.) The revised framework always has the partition columns available if the file metadata columns are available. The columns are of type Nullable VARCHAR (since, if a partition does not exist, it is set to null.)\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to a) ensure we have plenty of tests of current behavior, and b) go with the new behavior as we switch to the new readers.

The new framework places the partition columns at the end of each row. The thinking is that different readers may see a different number of directories. By placing the partitions at the end, the rest of the row need not shift back and forth as new partition fields are added.
