We do not want PUBLIC to have this right, since we\nare uploading code to the server. The other is naming: org.trafodion.mgmt\nis probably too generic, this is about UDR library management. IMHO, it\nwould be good to put the code under\ncore/sql/src/main/java/org/trafodion/udr/library_management.

here is one comment I want to make: We currently use the following ranges:\n\n-p rand uses ports between 12000 and 24000\n-p fromDisplay uses ports above 24000. If the display is less than 42, it stays below the boundary of the ephemeral range, which usually starts at 32K.\n\nSince -p fromDisplay is meant to be deterministic, -p available should not use ports above 24000, since that would break the idea that once you have a display running, that guarantees a corresponding port range. Could we make -p available stay in the range between 12000 and 24000?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/165608063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/165615753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/234#issuecomment-165615753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/234","id":165615753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTYxNTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T23:34:39Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T23:34:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test Passed.  https://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/218/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/165615753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/165623289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/203#issuecomment-165623289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/203","id":165623289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTYyMzI4OQ==","user":{"login":"hegdean","id":12959032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean","html_url":"https://github.com/hegdean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hegdean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-18T00:26:04Z","updated_at":"2015-12-18T00:26:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do we have developer regression for spj mgmt code.

I didn't think of that when coding this solution. I was following the spirit of the algorithm that was there. Comparing keys would achieve multi-column family support. To Suresh's comment, hopefully HBase provides methods already to compare keys, so we can use those when we get to that point. Selva's ideas of using other metrics are worth exploring as well. I am not sure what to do about the memstore issue. The good news is that it throws things off by only 10-20%, whereas before things could be off by orders of magnitude. I think I'll go ahead and commit this change since it is an improvement on what's there. I will file a follow-on JIRA for multi-column families.

Yes. That's correct Hans. But upon further testing, the upsert command  for non-aligned format table has problems with omitted columns that has current_timestamp  as the default value when the row or the timestamp column doesn't exist already. So, I am working on a fix. The final fix that is being proposed is\n\nUpsert for non-aligned format  will be transformed into merge when the column with current_timestamp as the default value is omitted. For rest of the cases, the current implementation works great.\n\nUpsert for aligned format will be transformed to merge when a new CQD TRAF_UPSERT_DEFAULT_COLUMN_VALUE_OVERWRITE is 'OFF'.  When this CQD is set to 'ON', the upsert command will use the default value for the omitted columns whether the row exists or not. Need some opinion what should be the default for this CQD. Should it be 'ON' or 'OFF' by default.\n\nSo, I will be pushing another commit when I am ready with the fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/166696607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/166697936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/227#issuecomment-166697936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/227","id":166697936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjY5NzkzNg==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T18:32:27Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T18:32:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, sounds very good!

I believe one of the cases it is seen is when zookeeper default logging is changed (as per the output in the Jira).\n\nI think we still need to do check if this can be handled in our bin  scripts or we should look at the corresponding zkcli code in dcs (use lastInfodexOf etc). Currently with the change and DEBUG/INFO on, repeat of a dcsstop will still give the sed error. Same should be the case for dcsstart (if no master is running) - script will try and do an ssh and sed on the zookeeper debug/info line. \n\nDo please check and let me know if the above observation is correct.
