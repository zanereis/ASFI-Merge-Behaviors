move forward with an actionable item, I think this issue should be scoped to the most common need, as the initial input to the issue was about invoking an action, I would say directly (invoking) or indirectly (fire trigger)\n\nI think starting with something simple for invoking and action and firing a trigger and just displaying the curl command.\nTo summarize implement a `--curl` flag for `wsk action invoke` and `wsk trigger fire`\nThis flag will just print the full curl command that user would simple copy paste in to a script or terminal, or inspect to understand the http call for these two specific commands\nExamples:\nprint curl command to invoke action\n\n```\n$ wsk action invoke /whisk.system/samples/echo -p message hola -b -r --curl\ncurl -d \"${WSK_PARAMS}\" -XPOST -H \"${WSK_CONTENT_HEADER}\" -H \"${CURRENT_AUTH_HEADER}\" \"${WSK_PATH}\"\n```\n\nprint curl command to fire a trigger\n\n```\n$ wsk trigger fire stockTrigger '{\"IBM\":200}' --curl\ncurl -d \"${WSK_PARAMS}\" -XPOST -H \"${WSK_CONTENT_HEADER}\" -H \"${CURRENT_AUTH_HEADER}\" \"${WSK_PATH}\"\n```\n\nThe ${xx} would be substitute with actual values.\n\nFor reference: here is a script I usually refer to when I want to use
