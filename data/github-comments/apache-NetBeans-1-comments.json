You could have introduced SplitDocumentHorizontallyAction which just extends SplitDocumentAction and calls super(tc, JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT). Same for SplitDocumentVerticallyAction.\r\n\r\nI believe initTopComponent only exists so you can have a no-arg constructor which is odd because you are instantiating the actions manually (so it must have to do with the registrations). Also, you know that `(tc instanceof Splitable && ((Splitable)tc).canSplit())` before it's called.\r\n\r\nSo, what I am curious to learn is how does the shortcut work for your manually created instance?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/331559472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/331739275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4#issuecomment-331739275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4","id":331739275,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTczOTI3NQ==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-24T20:50:00Z","updated_at":"2017-09-24T20:50:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

Also the \"License: \" tag should probably be changed to something else than \"New BSD\" (e.g. \"BSD+jcip\"). Even if though this is probably not ever going to be used.\r\n\r\nFor notice - I suspect we will need different notices, one at the top level of the repository for things that are in the repository (which this is not), and a different one for binary builds (where the notice should contain exactly what is in the binary, not more, not less, in other words, this will probably differ between the platform and the Java IDE). And there needs to be enough data to construct such notices automatically, I don't think it is realistic to maintain them manually. Hence the request to add -notice.txt to external binaries if needed, so the build will be able to pick them up if needed.

Including the header for a single line (typically) file may be somewhat silly, but I am not sure if not adding the header is worth the discussion that will arise (given that, unlike in e.g. manifests, there is basically no issue with the header). Some of these files also already have a license header. So I was adding the headers to binaries-lists I was modifying, as that should not be wrong either way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/333610914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/333615184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/33#issuecomment-333615184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/33","id":333615184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzYxNTE4NA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T18:02:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T18:02:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My take: If a file needs to be edited, there is no draw back in adding the license header also.
