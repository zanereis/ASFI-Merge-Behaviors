One is global setting when building topology.\n\n```\nConfig config = new Config();\nconfig.put(Config.TOPOLOGY_TICK_TUPLE_FREQ_SECS, 5);\n```\n\nThe other one is local setting in bolt.\n\n```\n@Override\npublic Map<String, Object> getComponentConfiguration() {\n    Map<String, Object> conf = new HashMap<String, Object>();\n    conf.put(Config.TOPOLOGY_TICK_TUPLE_FREQ_SECS, 4);\n    return conf;\n}\n```\n\nAll bolt tasks will receive tick tuples in the same interval when existing global setting.\nOnce we set `Config.TOPOLOGY_TICK_TUPLE_FREQ_SECS` in bolt Foo `getComponentConfiguration()`, the value will override the global setting. And bolt Foo tasks will receive tick tuples in a interval different from other tasks.\n\nSo, it is not necessary to add `Config.TOPOLOGY_TICK_TUPLE_FREQ_SECS` in  `getComponentConfiguration()`.
