It might be worth getting Mark P's input on this.\r\n\r\nThe issue I'm seeing is in this section of code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal Map<String, Map<NodeIdentifier, ReportingTaskEntity>> entityMap = new HashMap<>();\r\n\r\nfor (final NodeResponse nodeResponse : successfulResponses) {\r\n            final ReportingTasksEntity nodeResponseEntity = nodeResponse == clientResponse ? responseEntity : nodeResponse.getClientResponse().readEntity(ReportingTasksEntity.class);\r\n            final Set<ReportingTaskEntity> nodeReportingTaskEntities = nodeResponseEntity.getReportingTasks();\r\n\r\n            for (final ReportingTaskEntity nodeReportingTaskEntity : nodeReportingTaskEntities) {\r\n                final NodeIdentifier nodeId = nodeResponse.getNodeId();\r\n                Map<NodeIdentifier, ReportingTaskEntity> innerMap = entityMap.get(nodeId);\r\n                if (innerMap == null) {\r\n                    innerMap = new HashMap<>();\r\n                    entityMap.put(nodeReportingTaskEntity.getId(), innerMap); // this getId() is the same for all nodeReportingTaskEntity (it's the service's ID), so the map is overwritten each time\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                innerMap.put(nodeResponse.getNodeId(), nodeReportingTaskEntity);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ReportingTasksEntityMerger.mergeReportingTasks(reportingTasksEntities, entityMap); // when we merge, only the last seen innerMap entry is entered in this entityMap, so we don't merge all nodes\r\n        \r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis screenshot shows what will eventually make its way to the ReportingTaskEntityMerger:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1343\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-27 at 12 34 03 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38888042/181162289-2531666e-4389-45de-b4d3-22e6a476bf79.png\">\r\n\r\nwhich shows that the entity map (Map<String, Map<NodeIdentifier, ReportingTaskEntity>) contains only one nested/inner map value despite being a 3 node cluster, because the String key for the outer map is going to be the same on all nodes (the service ID). To me, this means that the mergers using this section of code have not been merging all nodes correctly. It might be worth refactoring the above code to make it a bit simpler/clearer and fixing the keying issue.\r\n\r\nOther than this, I will commit some changes made that I think should resolve current questions raised in the review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1196252370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1196571706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6190#issuecomment-1196571706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6190","id":1196571706,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5HUjw6","user":{"login":"CloudWise-Lukemiao","id":76942485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTQyNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76942485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao","html_url":"https://github.com/CloudWise-Lukemiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloudWise-Lukemiao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-27T10:50:18Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T10:50:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > Thanks for pointing out the problem.

I went through the code and overall I like the clean design and the functionality. A few small comments:\r\n- I tested the UriBuilder, it's easy to use and functionally works well.\r\n- I prefer the builder pattern instead of the fixed interface order, but since http requests consist of 3 fixed parts and this will not be extended, and since it would require changing the whole design and is a matter of taste anyway, it's still perfectly usable.\r\n- I tried out the WebClientService. I created a custom processor that sends different HTTP requests to a HandleHttpRequest -> HandleHttpResponse NiFi flow. I have tested the service using TLS and a proxy server.

Not sure if Java allows you to create a module with name or not, to be honest (they don't allow you to create a Class in a package called `java.ottobackwards`, though.)\r\n\r\nBut in any case, I think that's fine.

This configuration seems to achieve the intent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        <rollingPolicy class=\"ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy\">\r\n            <fileNamePattern>${org.apache.nifi.bootstrap.config.log.dir}/nifi-deprecation_%d.%i.log</fileNamePattern>\r\n            <maxFileSize>10MB</maxFileSize>\r\n            <maxHistory>10</maxHistory>\r\n            <totalSizeCap>100MB</totalSizeCap>\r\n        </rollingPolicy>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may be a corner case, due to logback being fed logging events so quickly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1224193543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1224203090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6300#issuecomment-1224203090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6300","id":1224203090,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5I99tS","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T15:03:39Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T15:03:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the thorough testing @greyp9, great recommendation on the `totalSizeCap` property!
