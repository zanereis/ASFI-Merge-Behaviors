LIST（以生成pred数据为例子）\n我把im2rec.py这个文件拷贝到数据存在文件夹，比如叫data,然后data里有train,val,pred三个文件夹，分别存放训练，验证，预测数据，然后运行\n\npython im2rec.py .\\pred\\ .\\pred\\ --list=1 --recursive=1\n\n然后会在pred里面生成三个文件，其中只有_train.lst有数据，把它改名为pred.lst，然后拷贝到data文件夹\n\n同样方法处理 train,red,val\n\n2)制作REC\npython im2rec.py .\\pred .\\pred\\ --resize=50 --quality 100\n\n就会生成pred.rec文件\n然后同样处理train,val\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233901787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233902443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2772#issuecomment-233902443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2772","id":233902443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzkwMjQ0Mw==","user":{"login":"luoruisichuan","id":16890029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODkwMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16890029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan","html_url":"https://github.com/luoruisichuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T09:43:17Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T09:43:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"但我用make_list.py文件运行生成了lst文件没有问题呢。我刚才把/都改为\\试了下，还是不行，估计不是这个问题。\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233902443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233903189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2772#issuecomment-233903189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2772","id":233903189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzkwMzE4OQ==","user":{"login":"luoruisichuan","id":16890029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODkwMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16890029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan","html_url":"https://github.com/luoruisichuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T09:46:37Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T09:46:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我用的im2rec是最新版的，是把make_list和im2rec合并到im2rec.py中一起了的，不知道是什么问题。\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233903189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233903678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2772#issuecomment-233903678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2772","id":233903678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzkwMzY3OA==","user":{"login":"luoruisichuan","id":16890029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODkwMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16890029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan","html_url":"https://github.com/luoruisichuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoruisichuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T09:48:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T0

the forward pass in inference mode is now consistent with Torch. But I'm having problems with the backward pass. Particularly, problems are caused by the dropout descriptor, which requires a permanent state attached at initialization (see cudnnSetDropoutDescriptor), and according to the docs, \"No other function should be writing to the memory pointed at by states argument while this function is running. The user is expected not to change memory pointed at by states for the duration of the computation.\" If you use NULL for the states (and remove dropout rate as an optional parameters), it causes failures in cudnnRNNForwardTraining. \n\nIts not simply a piece of workspace memory like the other examples, which get generic chunks of memory doing a forward or a backward pass. There is also no cuDNN dropout layer, so don't know how best to solve this from the other examples. cudaMalloc some memory?
