We already support serializing credentials into a client properties file. We just need to make sure that if a user sets the client properties file (vs. setting a token directly in the fluent API), we do not immediately read that file and store its contents as properties in the job. We should handle it either by putting the file in the distributed cache, or simply serialize the path to the file around so we can read it from HDFS directly in the input/output formats. This would basically mean protecting the contents of the client properties file in the new API the same way we treated the token file in the old API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/450680895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/450681144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/864#issuecomment-450681144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/864","id":450681144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDY4MTE0NA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T19:06:02Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T19:06:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I find it weird that an empty CLASSPATH item would be interpreted as \"current directory\", instead of requiring an explicit dot (.) for that.

I think there's a natural differentiation, which we could use: properties which can be set in ZooKeeper, and those that can't, but even those that can be set in ZooKeeper, there's not well-defined behavior as to when they will go into effect.

I made a thread in each Master and tserver that checks every 5 seconds if replication.name is set.  Then if it is set, startup all the services.  That seemed to be a reasonable time to check since any longer, and the tests began failing.  \r\n\r\nThe only other part in question was whether to kill the threads after starting the services.  I didn't see a graceful way to do that with SimpleTimer though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/451279080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/451432262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/402#issuecomment-451432262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/402","id":451432262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTQzMjI2Mg==","user":{"login":"jschmidt10","id":1583214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1583214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10","html_url":"https://github.com/jschmidt10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschmidt10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-04T12:33:40Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T12:33:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OBE'd by cached thread pool","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/451432262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/451438478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/849#issuecomment-451438478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/849","id":451438478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTQzODQ3OA==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-04T13:05:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T13:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have attempted to do that but since I already have a pull request on that fork,  Github is preventing me from making additional ones.

I merged the changes you made for #807, so that is done.  I looked into merging the changes for #810 however those changes are not ready and still need work. I have not looked at the changes for  #849,  I can look at those when they are in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nIn order to create multiple PRs you need to create multiple branches locally, push those branches to your fork, and then create a PR. You should also base your local master branch on upstream apache accumulo.  Below are the commands that I would execute to create multiple PRs AND get your master branch in a good state.  I have not tested these commands.  Let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# locally make sure you are on your master branch, which seems to be where all of your changes are\r\ngit checkout master\r\n# create a branch with a backup of the master commits\r\ngit checkout -b master-backup\r\n# esnsure your commit are there\r\ngit log\r\n# ensure you are on the master-backup branch\r\ngit status\r\n\r\n# switch back to the master branch\r\ngit checkout master\r\n# add a remote named upstream for apache/accumulo\r\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/accumulo.git\r\n# look at the remotes you have configured\r\ngit remote -v\r\n# reset your local master branch to be the same as apache/accumulo master branch\r\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\r\ngit checkout .\r\n# the following command should show things are clean (no changed files)\r\ngit status\r\n# make your local master branch pull change from apache/accumulo master.  Usually you would not \r\n# commit directly to your local master branch\r\ngit branch --set-upstream master upstream/master\r\n# the following command should pull the latest changes from apache/accumulo\r\ngit pull\r\n# create a branch called accumulo-810 based on master \r\ngit checkout -b accumulo-810\r\n# patch your changes to MiniAccumuloClusterImpl.java from the master-backup branch.  Only\r\n# accept the changes you made.  Since you forked this file has changed, so you are patching in an older \r\n# version of the file.  So do not patch in older code that had been changed.\r\ngit checkout --patch master-backup minicluster/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/miniclusterImpl/MiniAccumuloClusterImpl.java\r\n# Diff the accumulo-810 branch with master, should only see the changes you made\r\ngit diff master\r\ngit commit -am \"some message\"\r\n# The command below assumes origin is the remote for your fork of Accumulo.  It will push your branch.\r\ngit push -u origin accumulo-810\r\n# after pushing go to the github website and create a PR\r\n\r\n# You need to create another PR for #849.
