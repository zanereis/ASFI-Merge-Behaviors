for submitting this patch.  I agree that we should propagate errors to senders if errors occurred while processing their messages.  The addition of the `hasError` field in MessageHeader looks fine to me.\n\nIt looks like Future supports `onFailure` callbacks, so I wonder if we should signal errors by having `sendMessageReliably` check whether an error occurred and signal failure by calling `promise.failed`.  Note that an exception will be thrown if you call `Await.result()` on a future that fails.  Instead of registering an `onSuccess` callback and detecting failures inside of it, users would have to define an additional `onFailure` callback or define `onComplete` and pattern-match on `Success` or `Failure`.\n\nReturning a failed future might prevent bugs where users forget to check the `hasFailed` field, treat the failure message as a valid response, and experience unexpected behavior; instead, their code would either throw an exception or their callback would never run (assuming they never defined `onFailure`).\n\n@rxin Any thoughts on signaling failure through failed futures vs. the approach in this PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50426601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50426681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1586#issuecomment-50426681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1586","id":50426681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDI2Njgx","user":{"login":"javadba","id":410769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDc2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/410769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba","html_url":"https://github.com/javadba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javadba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T02:10:26Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T02:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chenghao-intel   Hi, I just ran  your suggested command line\n\n```\nsbt/sbt -Phive=true 'test-only org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExpressionEvaluationSuite'\n```\n\nThe results are the same (error) on my local machine as for the maven command line:\n- Strlen **\\* FAILED ***\n  [info]   Incorrect Evaluation: Strlen(????, UTF-8), actual: 12, expected: 4    (ExpressionEvaluationSuite.scala:129)\n\nSo that is  useful to know:  we get same result (same error) both from sbt and from maven testing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50426681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50426714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1480#issuecomment-50426714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1480","id":50426714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDI2NzE0","user":{"login":"watermen","id":1400819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen","html_url":"https://github.com/watermen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watermen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T02:11:00Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T02:11:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mateiz Without this, the DiskStore's shutdown hook is only called when spark on Standalone Mode.

We moved this part out of Executor and into the code that launches it, so I think it now covers the executor's whole lifetime.

Fix spark on yarn to work when the cluster is running as user \"yarn\" but the clients are launched as the user and want to read/write to hdfs as the user. \n```\n\nSo it seems like it would be inefficient to call runAs on each Spark task.

Do you have a suggestion on how to fix the above code snippet?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50439423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50439564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1490#issuecomment-50439564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1490","id":50439564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDM5NTY0","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T06:25:45Z","updated_at":"2014-07-29T06:25:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I looked at this (with some confusion).
