The changes look OK, I don't think we need the failure relationship.  The integration tests for PutKinesisStream and GetKinesisStream both worked fine.  I set up a small flow putting and getting records from a Kinesis stream to test the processors.  The processors do work, but I had a rough experience interrupted by various errors that required a NiFi restart to fix.  Errors include the following, not necessarily in this sequence:\n- ERROR [pool-123-thread-4] c.a.s.kinesis.producer.KinesisProducer Error in child process\n  java.lang.RuntimeException: EOF reached during read\n- ERROR [pool-37-thread-1] c.a.s.kinesis.producer.KinesisProducer Error in child process\n  java.lang.RuntimeException: Child process exited with code 137\n- ERROR [Timer-Driven Process Thread-2] o.a.n.p.a.k.producer.PutKinesisStream\n  com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.producer.DaemonException: The child process has been shutdown and can no longer accept messages.\n\nAre you familiar with any of these?  Once the child process errors show up, the PutKinesisStream processor seems to stop working.  I do not have a precise repro sequence yet, but they coincided with throughput around the throttle limit of my Kinesis Stream.  Stopping and starting the processor did not help.  I was running this on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance with permissions for Kinesis, Dynamo, and CloudWatch.  I am not sure how to evaluate if this is a KCL problem or a PutKinesisStream problem.\n\nOne suggestion I have for the error handling in PutKinesisStream would be to NOT log the entire batch of FlowFile (PutKinesisStream.java, lines 263, 268, and 272).  For example:\n\n```\n    if ( failedFlowFiles.size() > 0 ) {\n        session.transfer(failedFlowFiles, PutKinesisStream.REL_FAILURE);\n        getLogger().error(\"Failed to publish to kinesis {} records {}\", new Object[]{stream, failedFlowFiles});\n    }\n```\n\nWith the default batch size of 250, 250 x FlowFile::toString() adds up to a very large block of text that makes it difficult to find the error.  I'm not sure how helpful the flow file records are.  I certainly recommend putting the exception first, and maybe leaving out the files?

I've also added allowable values from boolean where I missed them.\n\nRegarding units (using KB instead of bytes and seconds instead of millis) - I found that some values were not exactly in kb or mins (eg: in producer max buffered interval case there was 100-9223372036854775807 millis value). Using the exact values as specified in the docs creates a one to one mapping to AWS code and avoids any mis-calculation/rounding error.  But let me know what you recommend.\n\nI am not quite sure of the your #1 comment (Use name as a key and displayName for the UI text, rather than just name.).  Let me know what you recommend and I will work on it.\n\nRegarding property - KINESIS_PRODUCER_FAIL_IF_THROTTLED - If set to true, the producer will not retry in case of throttling error.  The property KINESIS_CONSUMER_DEFAULT_DONT_CALL_PROCESS_RECORDS_FOR_EMPTY_RECORD_LIST - will avoid calling the producer if the records list is empty perhaps for performance reasons.  These properties were available and I wanted to expose them so that the user can configure them at their discretion.\n\nRegarding the issue of producer errors, these are known issues and I am including links from what I could find about them:\n#1 - EOF file issue - https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/issues/46\n#2 - Code 137 is a fatal error when the process is send a kill -9\n#3 - Child process has been shutdown is also producer issue - https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/issues/39\n\nI will see if I can find more about these issues but if you have more details/stacktrace about the above, let me know.\n\nPlease let me know if I have missed anything.\n\nThanks again for your detailed review/comments.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/223780986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/223816446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/257#issuecomment-223816446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/257","id":223816446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzgxNjQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-05T14:33:50Z","updated_at":"2016-06-05T14:33:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@olegz  any luck with this review?

the error messages did not contain anything helpful that indicated it was a memory issue, just the text `com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.producer.DaemonException: The child process has been shutdown and can no longer accept messages`.  Memory was discussed on one of the KPL issue tickets you found (thanks!), so I tried it out.\n\nI'm not sure if we can do anything to handle this, but I don't know Kinesis well.  One option would be to try to restart the child process when this error happens.  But I may have actually been doing that.  I stopped and started the PutKinesisStream processor several times, which recreates the KinesisProducer instance, and the [KinesisProducer javadoc](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-producer/blob/master/java/amazon-kinesis-producer/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/producer/KinesisProducer.java) claims this spawns a new child processor.  This might have actually worked, briefly, just that the new child process died shortly afterwards because of the same memory constraint.  So even if we automated that troubleshooting step in PutKinesisStream, the outcome for this particular issue would be the same.  Part of transparently using the KPL/KCL is that users will have to know how to troubleshoot them directly.\n\nThere is no special trick to getting NiFi to work on EC2, their Linux VMs are very similar to any other.  I am used to EC2, and find it convenient for testing.  EC2's \"micro\" sized instances, which I use because I am terribly cheap, double as a handy way to test resource constraints.  Have you had trouble with it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/224366854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/224371572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/303#issuecomment-224371572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/303","id":224371572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM3MTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"ckmcd","id":2707164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd","html_url":"https://github.com/ckmcd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckmcd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T18:29:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T18:29:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request should be good to go as all feedback has been incorporated.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/224371572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/224396754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/303#issuecomment-224396754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/303","id":224396754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDM5Njc1NA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-07T20:01:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T20:01:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ckmcd  looks good!
