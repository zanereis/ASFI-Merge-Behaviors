Looks like quite a bit of work!\n\nRohit thanks for CC-ing me in :)\n\nIt's a bit hard to read the pull request right now and provide review comments:\n- Github says there's nearly 7000 changed files so at a guess something went wrong there? I had a look, and it looks like KarlHarrisSungardAS/cloudstack is quite a ways behind master, which may explain that...? It's probably a good idea to make a copy of the feature branch, rebase it against current master, squash some of the commits together, and then re-send the pull request. Or, start another branch, and cherry-pick over just the changes that _should_ be in the change set.\n- git hasn't picked up on the relation between veewee and packer, it's probably good idea to give it some more hints. For example it would be good to see\n  https://github.com/KarlHarrisSungardAS/cloudstack/commit/892b11ec0230ce87d14370fd1055ac223096cc77#diff-67bdab8b08f1e110ceabe1a23c3d4011R1\n  compared to the veewee equivalent.\n- there's a lot of 'shuffling' and/or adding comments intermixed with functional changes. For example https://github.com/KarlHarrisSungardAS/cloudstack/commit/7f55a1ef032c29cb955e02c90da43c91739108d7#diff-95748c84d8b6be2da502091e69b748d9L30 you might think the 'set -x' is getting removed here, but it just moved down a bit amidst a few new comments.\n- there's a lot of commits that are seemingly unrelated to the actual change (probably cherry-picked from master onto the feature branch?), those will need to be filtered out I think.\n- there's a lot of 'archive' commits which have unfinished 'checkpoint' code. I imagine all that work gets finished 'later on' (like renaming _gitignore to .gitignore is one that I tracked) but it's not so easy to see. It'd be great if those things could be squashed together.\n\nAs far as content goes...\n\n1) Like sebastien says, veewee is in maintenance mode and moving to packer (replacing veewee) is definitely a good idea. This looks like a straightforward port, which if it works ok seems like the way to go. We _should_ make sure to do it in a way that's somewhat compatible with the jenkins.buildacloud.org setup. I don't think we could sustain maintenance of both packer and veewee builds for long, it'll be a pain to keep changes in sync. I'd want to drop veewee use completely.\n\n2) Testing the systemvm using vagrant is also obviously a good idea (we're doing much the same, over at https://github.com/schubergphilis/cloudstack/tree/feature/systemvm-persistent-config/tools/vagrant/systemvm see https://github.com/schubergphilis/cloudstack/commits/feature/systemvm-test for an abandoned branch having just test-related commits), though I don't understand why we'd need to use vagrant templates? The .box file that we get out of the veewee-based systemvm build imports (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/tools/appliance/build.sh#L466) just fine...\n\n3) For the stuff that seems to be planned _beyond_ these changes, it might be a good idea to pop by on the development mailing list and discuss plans. A few people at Schuberg Philis (my employer, where there's a few people working on cloudstack) have been working on redundancy for the virtual router for a few months now. We've found that making it work also involves a lot of changes outside of the systemvm, too, i.e. changing the orchestration logic in the java code to match changed behavior of the vpc router (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Refactor+for+Redundant+Virtual+Router+Implementation / https://www.slideshare.net/LeoSimons1/toolkit-posterccceu14-v2 ). @spark404 please do have a look at Karl's approach :)\n\ncheers,\n\nLeo\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/65199170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/65510807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/43#issuecomment-65510807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/43","id":65510807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTEwODA3","user":{"login":"joshk","id":8701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk","html_url":"https://github.com/joshk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-03T23:22:59Z","updated_at":"2014-12-03T23:22:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for my radio silence.\n\nI was not aware that sudo is required by your test suite.

This is part of building a self supporting unit\ntest framework using Packer/Vagrant. See below.\npatching nature of the systemvms. I will look at the references above as\nour work progresses.\n After looking a how Cloudstack implements both public and VPC routers; I\nhave chosen to concentrate on the systemvm and what is required to create a\nVPC redundant router with the minimum changes to the interface between the\nsystem virtual machine (scripts) and the Cloudstack management server. The\nidea is to add the ability for the existing VPC routers to route\ndynamically configured network topologies (tiers) by using the existing\n Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) network scripts. The goal is to\nonly add a boolean \"is redundant\" to the interface along with supporting\nscript code to configure Keepalived and Conntrackd for VPC redundant\nrouters. Note: this boolead variable is already used for the \"router type\"\nand the type \"VPC router\" ignores this variable. Currently the public\nrouters are redundant but only allow for a \"static\" network topology.\nBuilding the test framework using vagrant help with understanding how the\npublic routers work (keepalived/conntracd) and what is required to allow\nfor \"dynamically configured network topologies\".\nWe are currently looking a the refactoring of the Java code and still\nbelieve our work will complement this refactoring work quite well.;\n\nAs always, if you have an questions or comments do not hesitate to post\nthem on this
