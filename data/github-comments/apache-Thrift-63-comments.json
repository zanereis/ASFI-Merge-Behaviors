Java 8 is still supported (for security patches) until 2030 and many projects are still using it.\r\n> \r\n> According to Maven central many people are still on `1.16.0` or `1.14.1`: <img alt=\"image\" width=\"703\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1134248/232896165-75dec1d4-00ba-4046-8fb3-2bb0e350ab62.png\">\r\n> \r\n> I took the time and effort to come over here to create a PR, but probably a lot of people don't care.\r\n> \r\n> Why add another barrier to make it even harder for people to adopt newer versions? I think for `parquet-mr` it is very interesting to add support for UUIDs. However, we can't drop Java8 yet, and the price for not upgrading is not that high because the new features in the later Java versions are nice to have, but not required.\r\n> \r\n> If Thrift cares about interoperability, and having support across many languages (including versions), then we should support Java8.\r\n\r\nThe price is on both sides. Yes on one side dropping the support to java 8 means that projects still on java 8 can no longer update to newer version of thrift. But on the other side, not dropping the support to java 8 means that thrift project can not use any new feature that's introduced after java 8.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter we discussed in [thrift's maillist](https://lists.apache.org/thread/qlrtxc1yvrzdjkf1gqd2zcnvr49lz5y7), @Jimexist listed some of the features we _plan_ to use that requires the dropping of java 8.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1513777235/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1514006469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1514006469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1514006469,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85aPefF","user":{"login":"wgtmac","id":4684607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODQ2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4684607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac","html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-19T01:27:09Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T01:27:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CMIW, at least it does not take too much work to add Java 8 support back to thrift 0.18.x version as Java 11 features are not yet used.

still think it's a mistake to move backwards. We're just going to hit up against this again and need to have the conversation all over again.\r\n\r\nThere is value in moving the baseline, even if we haven't yet leveraged the newer Java features. If a contributor comes along and wants to make an improvement that uses Java 11, now they need to convince the community to move to Java 11 **and** adopt their changes. If we've already moved the baseline modestly (and 8 to 11 is pretty modest), then all they need to do is convince Thrift to adopt their changes on that newer baseline. If we don't move the baseline ahead of time, then we're asking contributors to justify moving to 11 whenever they want to make a change that uses 11. Those contributors are likely to face questions like: \"can you rewrite this in a Java 8 way?\" or \"is this really important enough of a feature to justify moving to 11?\". It's extra work for every contributor to justify the baseline move for *their* changes.\r\n\r\nProjects with requirements on older Java versions can just use older Thrift releases. They *don't have to upgrade* Thrift so aggressively. If they need Java 8, they can use a version of Thrift that is appropriate for Java 8. They don't have to use the newer version. What kind of project is updating its dependencies so aggressively, but insists on its dependencies update themselves conservatively? Either those projects can update aggressively, and expect their dependencies to do the same, or they can update conservatively, and stay on the older version. Either way, it should not be a problem for Thrift to update to a newer Java version for its next release. This is no different than with other libraries. Consider Jetty. Jetty 11 uses JakartaEE (jakarta) instead of JavaEE (javax) libraries. We would obviously recognize the argument as flawed if somebody insisted that Jetty 11 continue using JavaEE libraries because JavaEE is still ubiquitous. No, those projects needing to stay using JavaEE would just use Jetty 10, and not upgrade to Jetty 11. Again, I will say it: you do not have to update.

EMR can be configured to run on 11 (it's installed by default... just needs to be configured), and you can run Hadoop without EMR. Also, they will certainly change their default the moment they change anything else on it that requires a newer JDK.

Can I request a security-patched/bug-fix version for them?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1309\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26535726/234173762-f2c40b42-7b57-4926-8591-ea0281f9aaf8.png\">\r\n\r\nThrift 0.13.0 made lots of [breaking changes](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/v0.13.0/CHANGES.md#breaking-changes) including THRIFT-4725 in Java, that's one of the reasons why the lower versions are adopted widely today, even they have known CVEs. Drops Java8 support is another significant breaking change.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is the indirect consumer of Thrift may take a quite long time to adopt the new Thrift when breaking changes are introduced.\r\n\r\nLet's say that Apache Hive is a direct consumer of Apache Thrift, the latest stable release of Hive is [3.1.3](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hive/hive-metastore/3.1.3), which adopts Thrift 0.9.3.\r\n\r\nApache Spark depends on Hive 2.3.9(which also uses Thrift 0.9.3) now, Spark adopts Thrift 0.12.0 because it is compatible w/ 0.9.3, but can not use 0.13 or any above versions, because of the breaking change THRIFT-4725. (See detail in SPARK-37090)\r\n\r\nAssume the next Hive stable version 4.0.0 available in 2023, which likely ships [Thrift 0.16](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hive/hive-metastore/4.0.0-alpha-2), because it still supports Java8. It may take several years for the downstream project(e.g. Spark) of Hive to adopt Hive 4.0 and therefore adopts Thrift 0.16. But what about the downstream of Spark? Will 0.16 get maintained on those days?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1521164034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1521989175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1521989175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1521989175,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85at7Y3","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-25T15:22:07Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T15:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Jimexist Done!\r\n\r\n> Can you find a counter argument that say maybe by 2024 it is a good time for thrift to upgrade to Java 11+?

Ideally, we advocate upstream do maintenance releases to make this easier on everybody downstream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1523747821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1523953423","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1523953423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1523953423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85a1a8P","user":{"login":"Jens-G","id":5834733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Jens-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-26T19:46:04Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T19:46:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> You can still keep up the latest version in any release series that you consider \"currently active\"\r\n\r\nBut that's what we do.- The most recent one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1523953423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1523989739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1523989739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1523989739,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85a1jzr","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-26T20:13:22Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T20:13:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > You can still keep up the latest version in any release series that you consider \"currently active\"\r\n> \r\n> But that's what we do.- The most recent one.\r\n\r\nMaybe I wasn't clear enough. What I was trying to say is that you could have more than one release series considered \"currently active\" and leave up the most recent of *each* series. That would still be compatible with INFRA release distribution policy.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the PMC decided that 0.9.x and 0.12.x are considered currently active in addition to the latest, 0.18.x, then you could have 0.9.3.1, 0.12.0, and 0.18.1 up there. INFRA distribution policy would only dictate that 0.18.0, 0.9.0, 0.9.1, 0.9.2, and 0.9.3 are archived (plus all 0.13.x-0.17.x). It doesn't require you to archive 0.9.3.1 and 0.12.0 if the PMC still considers those to be active.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be happening today is that Thrift only considers 0.18.x to be currently active, so 0.18.1 is available, but nothing earlier. But that can change with a simple PMC decision.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1523989739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1523995801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2785#issuecomment-1523995801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2785","id":1523995801,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U85a1lSZ","user":{"login":"Jens-G","id":5834733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Jens-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-26T20:19:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T20:19:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Propose
