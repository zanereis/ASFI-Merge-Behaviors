The use case is the following: Assume SystemML and it's config file is put into some system directory on each node in a shared cluster. This means all users of that cluster share the common setup. However, individual users can overwrite any subset of configurations. With the change, a user would be forced to suddenly specify ALL configurations.

For example in \"isInLoop\", you only investigate the if branch, you never jump into related functions, and you only investigate hop DAG root nodes (missing recursive DAG processing w/ memoization) - we want to check parents of transient read, not inputs to transient write. \n2) Optimizer performance: Please recompile each statement block just once if required, not for every candidate that might be in the same block.\n3) Simplifications: I would also strongly suggest various simplifications to make the code easier to understand and debug. First, you don't need separate cases for parfor and for if you do equivalent things; parfor is subclass of for, so any for handling covers both. Second,  you could do almost everything in getUIPConsumerList, isInLoop and validateUIPConsumerList on OptNodes which allows for simple tree processing (because it only represents containment) - only for leaf nodes, you get the associated Hop and do the remaining checking. Third, is this UIPCandidateHop really required? Almost all the information is available at hops and optnodes.\n4) Code cleanup: First, please wrap any log debug messages into LOG.isDebugEnabled, especially if you construct strings. Second, please use foreach instead of indexed access on collections  unless you need the index or remove elements from the lists. Third, please don't use \"} else {\" - it is unreadable.\n5) Tests: First, you need to put the (1==1){} cut into the function; otherwise your function is inlined. Second, a couple of tests regarding the issues raised under 1) would be good. Third, please move your specific code out of AutomatedTestBase into your own tests. \n6) Statistics: The maintenance of update in-place counters is currently not thread-safe. Since the only place where this is used is parfor, you need to add this. Please either remove or use atomics/synchronized.\n7) Explain: It would be good not to introduce unnecessary complexity. Since, update in-place markers are only set on DataOp, we should extend the output for DataOps of type tread, maybe only if it is marked for update in place.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/177883665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/178128927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/58#issuecomment-178128927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/58","id":178128927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODEyODkyNw==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-01T18:56:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-01T18:56:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@deroneriksson, @mboehm7 Great, thanks for the feedback.

Examples include (a) the handling of control structures, (b) function parameter handling, (c) parameter expression handling. Please try to consolidate or comment why you want to leave it - if there's a good reason, that's fine too.\n2) Commented code: Could you please also delete the unused commented code fragments (it's unnecessary to keep that since it can be restored from the history and only confuses people).\n3) Error messages: There are a couple of error messages that are completely useless. An example is \"incorrect lvalue ... strange\" - even if we think a certain code path will never be taken, it will happen and we don't want these kinds of messages showing up in error logs.\n4) Package qualification: Please also remove any unnecessary package specification of classes - the only acceptable reason would be that you want to use two classes from different packages in the same file. In such a case, please use the minimal package extension to differentiate them, not the full package name.\n5) Unnecessary files: Please remove any unnecessary files like \"package-info.java\". If the only reason is a global comment, add it to the main entry class of that package. In this particular case, we could just remove it. Also, please don't put JIRA numbers into any comments.\n6) Unnecessary class nesting: Could you please flatten SyntacticErrorListener ? Why would we need a class that has only another class (CustomErrorListener ) in it? \n7)  Unknown data type parsing: Further, the current version of getConstIdFromString seems a bit like to hack. Could you please think about a cleaner version, maybe based on valid characters (please also have a look at existing commons libs like StringUtils).\n8) Code style: Finally, it would be good to fix the remaining code style issues as well. This includes (a) typos (e.g., constoubleIdExpressionHelper), (b) the unnecessary use of \"compareTo()==0\" (\"equals\" would do just fine), (c) conditional boolean assignments (e.g., val=false; if( A.equals(B) ) val=true; should become val = A.equals(B), and (d) please try to avoid \"} else {\" since it's unreadable.

However, since you always maintain that in debug mode, it might create problems in specific cases, where multiple parfor optimizations happen concurrently (e.g., parfor w/ fixed parameters w/ nested optimized parfor). Please, either use ThreadLocal state or a specific flag that is only enabled by your test.\n2) Logging: Furthermore, you currently output a lot of detailed information. Since debug is used to get a high-level idea of parfor plans and applied rewrites, please move your detailed output wrt candidates and things alike to log level TRACE.\n3) Flag in parfor optimizer: Please add a flag \nAPPLY_REWRITE_UPDATE_INPLACE_INTERMEDIATE to OptimizerRuleBased (enabled by default). This will allow us to quickly disable this feature if issues show up after the initial commit.\n4) Statistics: First, please only show the update-in-place stats if it was a parfor script (because parfor is the only place where we apply it right now). Have a look at (parforOptCount>0). Second, currently you redundantly use atomics and synchronized, please remove the unnecessary sychronized from the increment methods.\n5) Code Style: First, please update the comment \"guaranteed to be a last-level block (see hop change)\" - it's wrong because you recompile the entire parfor program. Second, some minor stylistic issues: size() == 0 -> isEmpty; size() > 0 -> !isEmpty(); listUIPRes.removeAll(listUIPRes) -> listUIPRes.clear(); and if( (bInLoop) || (pb instanceof WhileProgramBlock ... ) becomes if( bInLoop || pb instanceof WhileProgramBlock ). Third, please make your methods private or protected (not package visible). Fourth, please rename getUIPConsumerList -> rGetUIPConsumerList\nand validateUIPConsumerList -> rValidateUIPConsumerList to make clear these are recursive methods.\n6) Tests: First, it would be nice if your UpdateInPlaceTest would include a class-level comment what the individual tests are (e.g., test for functions, test for interleaved statements, etc). Second, updateinplace12.dml does not need the if(1==1) cut because it already includes control flow. Third, please remove unused code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/181741156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/182186678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/66#issuecomment-182186678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/66","id":182186678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjE4NjY3OA==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T04:01:49Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T04:01:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did

However, it does not affect usability with respect to the end user. The main advantage of having Java API is \"easy integration with current dev setup\".\n\nBtw, I am OK with having a Scala API into incubator-systemml if following conditions are met:\n1. \"mvn verify\" creates a jar with the Scala APIs in it and also runs the unit tests that verifies the Scala API. This will ensure that the future commits do not break the Scala API. \n2. Common dev setup (preferably eclipse or Scala IDE) for both the Scala API and the runtime. That is, scala files are compilation units inside the eclipse editor. This will encourage other committers to work contribute to the Scala API.\n\nThanks,\n\nNiketan.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/185344730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/185420592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/70#issuecomment-185420592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/70","id":185420592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTQyMDU5Mg==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T21:41:35Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T21:42:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm in favor of replacing the existing Java APIs ([LogisticRegression](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/api/ml/LogisticRegression.java), [MLContext](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/api/MLContext.java), etc.) with Scala versions in order to alleviate the types of issues raised here that are inherent with user-facing APIs.  We could simply place these Scala APIs in `src/main/scala` and keep the same package structure as before.\n\nSo, currently our `LogisticRegression` API is is part of the `org.apache.sysml.api.ml` package, and therefore the actual [LogisticRegression.java](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/api/ml/LogisticRegression.java) file is located at `src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/api/ml/LogisticRegression.java`.  We could instead place the Scala file at `src/main/scala/org/apache/sysml/api/ml/LogisticRegression.scala`, and use the same `org.apache.sysml.api.ml` package identifier.\n\nTo alleviate build issues, we can just integrate Scala compilation into Maven.  A quick search shows that the [scala-maven-plugin](https://github.com/davidb/scala-maven-plugin/) can do just this by simply adding a few lines to the [pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/pom.xml), as shown in [1].  Eclipse integration appears to also be easy by simply adding a few more lines to the [pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/pom.xml), as show at the bottom of [2].  Then, a simply `mvn package`, or Eclipse (or IntelliJ) build would work as usual.  No additional JARs would be necessary in the final packaged `SystemML.jar` file either.\n\nThis route would also be great in preparation for [SYSTEMML-451](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-451), which aims add DML as an embedded Scala DSL.\n- [1]: [http://davidb.github.io/scala-maven-plugin/example_java.html](http://davidb.github.io/scala-maven-plugin/example_java.html)\n- [2]: [http://davidb.github.io/scala-maven-plugin/faq.html](http://davidb.github.io/scala-maven-plugin/faq.html)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/185420592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/185436348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/70#issuecomment-185436348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/70","id":185436348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTQzNjM0OA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T22:29:06Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T22:29:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dusenberrymw +1 on creating Scala API for LogisticRegression, but am not sure whether we need to convert MLContext to Scala. \n\nscala-maven-plugin solution looks good to resolve condition 1.

catch @dusenberrymw . I had assumed commons-io was already added to the libs for standalone since it is such a common library, but I was mistaken. I'll update the standalone assembly to include it. \n\n@mboehm7 I don't believe there was a consensus. My main concern with this issue is that I would prefer not to intimidate new users by requiring them to do things like `echo '{\"rows\": 306, \"cols\": 4, \"format\": \"csv\"}' > data/haberman.data.mtd` when they first try to use one of the main algorithms. The required metadata file for csv (if there was no format parameter) was one of the things I first felt frustrated by when I started using SystemML. If I created a csv file containing \"1,2,3,4\", I did not want to also have to create a JSON-formatted metadata file. Perhaps we can get feedback from some new users to find out if others feel the same way?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/186358732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/186422880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/66#issuecomment-186422880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/66","id":186422880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjQyMjg4MA==","user":{"login":"ethanyxu","id":5972986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ethanyxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T21:47:18Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T21:47:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As a new user of SystemML I vote for the idea.

@gweidner - couple of comments:\n\n1) Tests: For testing purposes it would be good to use a larger eps value (e.g., 0.1 instead of 1e-17); otherwise we're always in danger that it is ignored given the test tolerance of 1e-6.\n2) Rewrites: Currently, you apply this rewrite for both / and *. Since the runtime only supports /, please change it to / only when checking for VALID WDIVMM binary operations. \n3) Instruction Generation: Could you please use the same instruction layout for CP and Spark and only use \"instruction patching\" for MR where it is required? This applies to the lops WeightedDivMM and WeightedDivMMR.\n4) Spark Quaternary Instruction: According to 3, you would need to change the instruction parsing. Also, please think about a solution where eps is not put into the operator but treated as input data.\n5) LibMatrixMult: In matrixMultWDivMMDense, could the case \"scalar and x==null\" happen at all; if not, please simplify. In matrixMultWDivMMSparseDense, where do you actually pass in the scalar value? In all three methods, could you please unpack the scalar value once and reuse it over all iterations?\n\nOnce, this pr is in, could you please also have a look into step 2 of [SYSTEMML-510]? I'll take care of step 3.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/186986172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/187009823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/77#issuecomment-187009823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/77","id":187009823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NzAwOTgyMw==","user":{"login":"gweidner","id":12058879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner","html_url":"https://github.com/gweidner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gweidner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-22T04:48:40Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T04:48:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you Matthias for the feedback.
