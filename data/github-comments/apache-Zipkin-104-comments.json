@llinder @zeagord and I ended up was that we needed a way to choose which trace IDs would be associated with a period represented by a dependency link. Otherwise, you have to store rows for every pair related to that link. In other words, the bounds force you to choose somehow and we stopped at that.\r\n\r\nWhat happened since, was some backends have the ability to store the metric rows associated with a link, for example https://github.com/jeqo/zipkin-storage-kafka or the https://github.com/adriancole/zipkin-voltdb. This means that at query time, you could choose exemplars which are more representative and not as biased as trying to do that on each host prior to reporting.\r\n\r\n## Aside as link picking is not that much different than normal time series picking:\r\n\r\nLong long ago, the first version of zipkin had favorite functionality. This was basically manual picking which could be arbitrary or to mark something exemplary. We've had a ton of various thought works happening around this topic since, and in many areas. Below is only a survey of the first that come to mind.\r\n\r\nI think Jaana actually started the fire on people wanting to use exemplars also for arbitrary metric points https://medium.com/observability/want-to-debug-latency-7aa48ecbe8f7\r\n\r\nOne idea we had in micrometer support was to do try to keep a configuration which could decide what is exemplary and use evaluate local histograms towards that. Lacking that, we could certainly just pick randomly rate-limited.\r\n\r\nLater, we learned about haystack, which punts all the way down the line, and use a decoration service: adaptive alerting. In other words, they don't pretend to know what's exemplary up-front. Instead, they use some sort of model selection to do that and update your exemplar store somehow.\r\n\r\nLast year, someone told me excitedly about their zipkin exemplar integration.. It looked basically the same as Jaana's pictures. Grafana with zipkin trace exemplars co-plotted. However, it took significant hacking due to the lack of integration in grafana etc. Here, we discussed with LINE the same topic and resolved to park the grafana idea as their api was supposed to change dramatically to formally support things without massive hacks.\r\n\r\nAll this said, I noticed some projects are picking up similar work again, ex [jaeger exemplar support](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-lib/pull/79), I figured I'd recap where we got on links and picking favorites has significant overlap with doing the same for arbitrary metrics derived spans and picking favorites (exemplars).\r\n\r\nhope this helps any lurkers or anyone here that wants to try again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/592839402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/592920748","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2996#issuecomment-592920748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2996","id":592920748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MjkyMDc0OA==","user":{"login":"jcchavezs","id":3075074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzUwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3075074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs","html_url":"https://github.com/jcchavezs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcchavezs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-29T08:42:24Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T08:42:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Adding @eleduardo because yesterday I saw he is more used to use technical terms in pure spanish than me.
