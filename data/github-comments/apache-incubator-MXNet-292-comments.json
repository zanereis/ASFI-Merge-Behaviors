From the experimentations, the behavior varies case by case. Some combinations of versions work fine. Some are not. So, the workaround @larroy pointed (LD_PRELOAD env variable) might be a good option. Also, it is recommended to use MKL-enabled MXNet with non-MKL python to get the best performance for neural network workloads.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/356469022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/356470902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/9367#issuecomment-356470902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9367","id":356470902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQ3MDkwMg==","user":{"login":"leleamol","id":19983848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTgzODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19983848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol","html_url":"https://github.com/leleamol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T01:35:37Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T01:35:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptrendx  I have updated this tests so that we can run the tests on P2 instances until we have fix in NCCL.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/356470902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/356470925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1546#issuecomment-356470925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1546","id":356470925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQ3MDkyNQ==","user":{"login":"jeremiedb","id":18605903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjA1OTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18605903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremiedb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremiedb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T01:35:46Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T01:35:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kmarlen1988, can you confirm whether your intent to limited to prediction or to retrain a complete model?
