So the issue with the OperationalError above is probably to do with \"using password: NO\" and not the IP address of the host.  Is something removing the password from the sqlalchemy uri?  I see places where the connection password is masked, but I doubt this is the issue.\n\nI did a dump of the ab_\\* tables, once from caravel running with mysql and another running with sqlite, just to see if any of the contents were different after the examples were loaded.  I only see two differences:\n1) on mysql ids are longs (e.g., 1L) while on sqlite they are just integers (e.g., 1)\n2) on sqlite strings are unicode (e.g., u'can_this_form_post') while on mysql they are strings (e.g., 'can_this_form_post').\n\nmysql:\n\n```\nselect * from ab_role\n(1L, 'Admin')\n(2L, 'Public')\n(3L, 'Alpha')\n(4L, 'Gamma')\n```\n\nsqlite:\n\n```\nselect * from ab_role\n(1, u'Admin')\n(2, u'Public')\n(3, u'Alpha')\n(4, u'Gamma')\n```\n\nI'd be surprised if this caused a problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/245448002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/245452076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1070#issuecomment-245452076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1070","id":245452076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTQ1MjA3Ng==","user":{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-07T23:37:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T23:37:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dennisobrien -

team is adding a third kind of datasource, our backend api to caravel besides Druid and Sql. Currently in caravel, the switch between these two datasources are hard-coded, which requires us to do the same when we add our customized datasource engine. So we need to make changes inline to make things work. So we need to maintain our fork and deal with merges. Ideally, we want to keep our changes from upstream caravel as separated as possible. So it's easier to maintain and keep updated with upstream. I've created an issue before https://github.com/airbnb/caravel/issues/1035, and was suggested to send a PR. So here's the changes I'm hoping to get in. I'm creating an instance of a registry that register all desired datasource type and Models at initialization of the app. So it'll pick up the Model associated with the datasource type in Slice Model and Views.py explore method. Let me know what you think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/245694225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/245714493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1075#issuecomment-245714493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1075","id":245714493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTcxNDQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T19:36:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T19:36:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It's good to have this button hidden somewhere if the state ever gets corrupt or incompatible with new code.
