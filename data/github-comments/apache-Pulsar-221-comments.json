@itaross Thanks for your feedback. Do you want to test the pulsar source or pulsar sink using java code in a [similar way](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/functions-debug/#debug-with-localrun-mode)?\r\n> \r\n> For example:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n>         SourceConfig sourceConfig = new SourceConfig();\r\n>         sourceConfig.setName(\"exclamation\");\r\n>         sourceConfig.setClassName(ExclamationFunction.class.getName());\r\n>         ...\r\n>         LocalRunner sourceLocalRunner = LocalRunner.builder().sourceConfig(sourceConfig).build();\r\n>         sourceLocalRunner.start(false);\r\n>     }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nYes, exactly. I have developed quite few functions and having the ability to debug them boosted my productivity exponentially.\r\nFor the connectors I have developed a modified version of the influxdb2 connector and it has been really hard to get it to work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/636761329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/636779830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7078#issuecomment-636779830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7078","id":636779830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjc3OTgzMA==","user":{"login":"aloyszhang","id":48062889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDYyODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48062889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang","html_url":"https://github.com/aloyszhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloyszhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-01T10:48:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T10:48:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot
