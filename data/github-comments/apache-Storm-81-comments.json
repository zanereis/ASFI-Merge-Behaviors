It is plausible that the numbers you see are due to max spout pending.</p>\n\n<p>If you are receiving data in bursts, you would pull them off much faster with 8 spouts than 1.  Then the spout output queues would be relatively large in size, and since the tuple is sitting in the output queue longer, the overall latency is higher.  The burstiness would account for low bolt capacity figures; typically high spout output queue sizes correlate with higher bolt utilization than you're seeing.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, it seems odd to me to point at a very specific application profile and then come to the conclusion that there is a bug in the spout.  You should run your tests with spout only and do throughput tests.  If you can pull less data off of kafka with 8 spouts than 1, then I would agree that something is odd.  But even that (purely hypothetical situation) would seem to be more likely to sit with the kafka client than with the storm implementation of kafka spout.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612545872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612534782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4578#issuecomment-2612534782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4578","id":2612534782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MzQ3ODI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-13T04:13:48Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:29:30Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user HeartSaVioR commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/521#discussion_r30201415\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/521#discussion_r30201415</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/utils/TransferDrainer.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -26,10 +26,10 @@</p>\n\n<p>     public class TransferDrainer {</p>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>private HashMap<String, ArrayList<ArrayList<TaskMessage>>> bundles = new HashMap();<br/>\n    +  private HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<ArrayList<TaskMessage>>> bundles = new HashMap();</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>public void add(HashMap<String, ArrayList<TaskMessage>> workerTupleSetMap) {</li>\n\t<li>for (String key : workerTupleSetMap.keySet()) {<br/>\n    +  public void add(HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<TaskMessage>> taskTupleSetMap) {\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    @d2r <br/>\n    Looking it again, it should stores tuples to buffer unless batch-end?

 While sending tuple, check task->node+port with read lock</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>we can ensure task->node+port is safe within read lock\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>refer write lock inside of
