Another point I would like to discuss is whether the storage table should be registered in the catalog. I brought this up before but I think people haven't really voted for a solution. Generally the storage table can either be registered in the catalog or not. Most proposals in this thread suggested to register both the view and the storage table in the catalog. I would like to propose to only register the view in the catalog. My reasoning is that a materialized view is one logical entity and should therefore also appear in the catalog as one entity. This is also the behavior of most RDBMS and also cloud data warehouses like snowflake.\r\n> \tStrategy 1: register storage table in catalog \tStrategy 2: don't register storage table in catalog\r\n> Description \tMetadata locations for the view and storage table are stored in the catalog. Since both locations are tracked, each transaction is automatically atomic. \tOnly the location of the main view is stored in the catalog. A reference to the storage table metadata location is stored in the main view. An atomic update of this reference is the basis for making atomic changes to the storage table metadata file.\r\n> Pros \t\r\n> \r\n>     * Storage table can be addressed in the catalog\r\n> \r\n>     * Simple implementation\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \t\r\n> \r\n>     * only one entry for materialized view\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Cons \t\r\n> \r\n>     * 2 entities appear in the catalog\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \t\r\n>

There are chances that we use older commit hash as the expected hash with the latest client.

Currently, `divisions` is set to None, which is sub-optimal. (xref https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe-design.html?highlight=divisions#partitions, https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe-parquet.html?highlight=divisions#calculating-divisions). I'm seeing some stuff in `DataFile` that might help with setting those properly.\r\n3. I've never used (py)iceberg before, but I was pleasantly surprised with how straightforward this was. This is copy-pasting bits and pieces out of `pyiceberg.io.pyarrow`. With a proper refactor, this is even fewer net new lines of code.\r\n4. On the Dask side, we would be interested in making this more sophisticated, to allow operations on the Dask DataFrame to affect the original scan (https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/9970 and linked issues)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1443857629/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444062541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6651#issuecomment-1444062541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6651","id":1444062541,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WEqVN","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-24T17:15:24Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T17:16:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think that we have a general problem using options for writing to a table that we're trying to work around, but in the end it's probably not a good idea to use read and write options for branching.

Reads and writes need to use the same table state, but read and write options are not reliable for that. Dynamic pruning, in particular, does not copy the options\r\n3. SQL has no reliable way to set the read or write options\r\n\r\nI was talking with @aokolnychyi about this yesterday and I think he's right: the best way to solve these problems is to load a branch like we would a table, so that all uses of the branch/table are consistent. The read path does this by using `VERSION AS OF` and `TIMESTAMP AS OF` to load the table with the correct state. To get this working in other situations, I think we should go back to the original idea of using the branch name in the table identifier, like `catalog.db.table.branch`. While that's not ideal for column references (by default columns would be `branch.col` rather than `table.col`) it is the most reliable solution for writes, reads, and dynamic pruning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444062541/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444088767","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6930#issuecomment-1444088767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6930","id":1444088767,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WEwu_","user":{"login":"amogh-jahagirdar","id":87500546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTAwNTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87500546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar","html_url":"https://github.com/amogh-jahagirdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-24T17:29:00Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T17:29:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it's expected, although do agree the name is a bit confusing.

The downside is that consumer of the watermark info needs to aggregate and take the min of latest value from all writers. if we go with the conditional commit approach and fail the second commit with lower watermark, how would the second application handle the failure? we can also get into the situation where the second application may never able to commit. if it's watermark is forever behind the first application, the condition check will always be false. not sure if this is a desirable behavior.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Kafka data file committer use case, it is non-desirable to have all the parallel threads committing to the Iceberg table. If the parallelism is 100 or 1,000, there will be a lot of collisions and retries. The conditional commit can ensure the correctness. But it can be inefficient or infeasible with high parallelism. Flink Iceberg sink coalescing all data files to a single committer task so that there is only one committer thread (in a Flink job) committing to the iceberg table.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444388008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444547405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6926#issuecomment-1444547405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6926","id":1444547405,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WGgtN","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-24T21:37:47Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T21:37:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, @singhpk234 @szehon-ho!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444547405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1444629617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6012#issuecomment-1444629617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6012","id":1444629617,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85WG0xx","user":{"login":"flyrain","id":1322359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjIzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1322359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain","html_url":"https://github.com/flyrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flyrain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-24T23:03:07Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T23:03:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for the detailed review, @aokolnychyi !
