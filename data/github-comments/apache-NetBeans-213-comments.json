One commit could refactor, the other fix the bug/add a feature without obfuscating what is happening. (main reason why I advocated for the option of multi commit PRs at least)\r\n\r\nBut simple PRs like here can be described by a few bullet points in the commit msg and everyone can still see what is happening while looking at the diff.\r\n\r\nMany projects don't allow merges at all, they auto squash+rebase on \"merge\" (which also leads to an easy to understand history). The reason we decided to disable that one is because there were some problems with author headers in past. If the git account isn't properly setup mails can disappear etc. (I forgot the details but there were problems when author != committer in some circumstances). Sometimes too much choice is also bad. We had accidental merges where someone thought that squash was selected and the whole dev cycle got merged. Now there is only merge, so the last step of the review is to make sure the PR is properly squashed and that there are no surprises in the [commit header](https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/apache/netbeans/pull/7496.patch). Keep it simple works often best.\r\n\r\nHaving multiple commits per PR can also cause problems during git bisect, since extra care is needed to make sure each individual commit builds and tests.\r\n\r\nso in short: the thought is that most PRs can be one commit, but it can be useful to allow multiple for large PRs or special situations, e.g having commits from different authors in the same PR etc.\r\n\r\nI try to follow the same rule of course: the last item I worked on ended up being 4 commits, split into 3 PRs: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7512, https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7515, https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7513 (I almost made that 3 commits though)\r\n\r\nedit: also PRs _are_ the release notes.

COS stands for compile on save. As far as I see IDEWorkspaceReader1/2 classes are used to log changes, probably for debugging purposes, since I don't see anywhere attempts to parse the log lines on the other side (which is different to the event spy). So this should be fine. (c~urious that both files are identical~ one hooks into `org.sonatype...Reader` the other into `org.eclipse...Reader`)\r\n\r\nI played with cos a bit and it isn't working properly in NB 22.

It works. I appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI guess this is a matter of opinion. In my opinion empty space in editor pane signifies that no documents are open. The emptiness by itself has a function and some users (like me) rely on it to convey the information that nothing is open. Empty space doesn't automatically mean \"dead space\".\r\n\r\nIf you put some content in a place where a document is supposed to be you indicate that a document is open - without giving the user an option to close it (which for me personally is frustrating). And that something grabs user's attention away from the rest of the UI like the project tree or the file tree. Besides, this only shows a huge icon and a list of actions that are already available on the toolbar - a standard location.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty major UI change and in general I don't find it a very good practice to make changes for users without asking if they are interested, and worse, not giving them an (easy) option to say no.\r\n\r\n(Please don't take this personally. I know it's not a nice feedback to ask an author how to turn their feature off. I don't mean to be ungrateful, especially on an os project where people put in their own time.

If they build on top of each other, you can create new branches based on the PR branch for next step. However you should be prepared to rebase that work onto the finally reviewed PR branch.
