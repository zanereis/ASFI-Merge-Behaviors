In that solution, the developer was letting an interface's super interfaces (at same level) have different \"distances\" to it.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\ninterface A{ void foo(); }\ninterface B{ void foo(); }\ninterface C extends A, B{ void foo(); }\n```\n\nWhen in static compilation, a specific version of method is chosen by comparing \"distance\". In this case, the distance of A and B to C is apparently equal, which will result in GROOVY-6970. In [`org.codehaus.groovy.transform.stc.StaticTypeCheckingSupport`](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/transform/stc/StaticTypeCheckingSupport.java), line 890, we can find that the original solution was that let A and B have different \"distance\" by adding an additional `i`. I think the solution to GROOVY-6970 is not correct because it will result in GROOVY-7922, so I reverted it and re-fixed GROOVY-6970.\n\nHowever, I think the distance strategy is imperfect, an implementation of [JLS](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.5) is necessary.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/247625499/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/247647843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/419#issuecomment-247647843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/419","id":247647843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzY0Nzg0Mw==","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-16T16:37:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T16:37:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I definitely agree that it would be good to have some replacement for removing the last element from the list (the reverse of `add`).
