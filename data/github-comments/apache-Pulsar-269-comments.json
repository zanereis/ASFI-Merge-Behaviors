Now the broker has an `ackSet` to record the ack position of a message in `BatchMessage`. But the client did not return this ack position when calling `GetLastMessageId`. This will happen:\r\nThe MessagId of seek is `3:31:-1:0` and the lastMessageIdInBroker is `3:31:-1`.\r\nTherefore, when compareTo is called, it must return <0, which causes hasMessageAvailable to return false.\r\nWhen the producer starts batch sending, if the returned message is `BatchMessageId`, this problem will be triggered. If it is `MessageIdImpl`, it will pass the test.\r\nI will try to fix
