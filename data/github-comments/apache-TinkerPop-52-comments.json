I noticed documentation generation failures for sparql-gremlin which pointed to a problem with AND. When you had said that AND wasn't optimized I didn't take that to mean that it wasn't working at all and clearly we didn't have tests in place for that. I've added a test along with the reverting of the change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/commit/d67f7c9c757bfeeaedec4d6650640c1cc4b0aed2\r\n\r\nI did try to fix the problem first prior to reverting, but given how close we are to release (Monday) I didn't think I was going to easily solve the problem so it was simply safer to revert. In doing that investigation though I do now better understand what these changes were doing. As I wrote in the commits on the above commit, It made me wonder if we should try to simply optimize `match()` better so that it gives providers a better chance at using an index...in that way we get improvements to `match()` for native usage and to sparql-gremlin and other language compilers. As I mentioned previously, we'll create new JIRA issues as needed for these improvements going forward.

I should have looked taken a closer look.\r\n\r\n> Could we just check that deserialized object is not null and throw exception.\r\n\r\nYes, I think that might be the best option as we expect the message to never be null.

The nature of a session and transactions within a session are already well tested that way. I think that here for a GLV you just want to ensure that the most basic aspect of a session works. The most basic tests to assert that I think would be to create a variable in one request like \"x = 1\" then in a second request send \"x = x + 1\" and assert that you get \"2\" as a result. you may wish to do that in a loop for multiple requests just to demonstrate the ongoing modifications to the session variable \"x\".\r\n\r\nen, get your point, I will change tests for session, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/589910236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/590035073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1250#issuecomment-590035073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1250","id":590035073,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDAzNTA3Mw==","user":{"login":"dzmitry-lahoda","id":757125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/757125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/dzmitry-lahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzmitry-lahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T07:20:01Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T07:22:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Seems in there is need for multi region connectivity.
