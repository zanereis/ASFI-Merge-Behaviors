This sort of depends on the situation, I guess:\n- On YARN, it may make sense, because the node will then go back into the pool of available resource\n- On standalone, it will anyways be there for Flink, so the TaskManager might as well keep trying to offer itself for work. Think of a network partitioning event - after the partitions re-joined, the cluster should work as a whole again.\n\nHow about the following: We have a config parameter how long nodes should attempt to register. YARN could set a timeout (say 2-5 minutes), while by default, the timeout is infinite.\n\nConcerning the attempt pause: Having attempts with exponential backoff (and a cap) is the common thing (and I think it was the default before). Start with a 50ms pause and double it each attempt and cap it at 1 or 2 minutes or so. If you miss early attempts, the pause will not be long. If you missed an all attempts within the first second, you are guaranteed to not wait more than twice as long as you already waited anyways.\n\nFor the sake of transparency and making sure that the states are actually in sync: How about we have three response messages for the registration attempt:\n1. Refused (for whatever reason, the message should have a string that the TM can log)\n2. Accepted (with the assigned ID)\n3. Already registered (with the assigned ID) - The current logic handles this correctly as well, but this will allow us to log better at the TaskManager and debug problems there much better. Since this is a mechanism which may have weird cornercase behavior, it would be good to know as much about what was happening as possible.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71133987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71134892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/324#issuecomment-71134892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/324","id":71134892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTM0ODky","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-23T01:48:25Z","updated_at":"2015-01-23T01:48:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As per recommendation from @StephanEwen, will NOT merge this to 0.8 until we need to cherry-pick fixes related to these files.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71134892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71148024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/328#issuecomment-71148024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/328","id":71148024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTQ4MDI0","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-23T05:00:12Z","updated_at":"2015-01-23T05:00:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the explation @tillrohrmann \n\n+1 for exponential backoff approach.

Unfortunately I have recently pushed the commits that allow operator chaining and I totally reworked the jobgraphbuilder and the output collectors.\n\nSo basically we need to move around some of the code that you have written.

The jar files of hadoop are added to the `CLASSPATH` variable in the `libexec/hadoop-config.sh` script. There, you see variables like `HADOOP_COMMON_LIB_JARS_DIR`, `HDFS_LIB_JARS_DIR`, `YARN_LIB_JARS_DIR`, ... being added to the CLASSPATH. In the very last step, they add the HADOOP_CLASSPATH variable (by default to the end of the classpath, but there is an additional option to put it in front of it).\n\nI found that we need to add this on Google Compute Engine's Hadoop deployment. They have their Google Storage configured by default but it currently doesn't work in non-yarn setups because the Google Storage jar is not in our classpath. On these clusters, the `HADOOP_CLASSPATH` variable contains the path to the storage-jar.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71429315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71432009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/301#issuecomment-71432009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/301","id":71432009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDMyMDA5","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-26T09:15:37Z","updated_at":"2015-01-26T09:15:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've completely changed the mechanism of setting a custom file name.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71432009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71433679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/301#issuecomment-71433679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/301","id":71433679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDMzNjc5","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-26T09:29:47Z","updated_at":"2015-01-26T09:29:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmmm, using the String pattern seems to be much more comfortable for users, no?\n\nIf a user wants to have the data written out with some kind of filename pattern, she needs to implement a new IF and overwrite a method instead of simply setting a configuration parameter.\nThe only thing you gain is that you can do some \"fancy\" arithmetics (+/- 1) with the task number.\nNot sure if that's worth it.
