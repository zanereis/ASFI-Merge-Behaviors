opinion is that Jena should be able to run on Java8 runtime. Research projects may upgrade quickly but enterprise deployments are another matter.\r\n\r\nTo ensure no accidents, I prefer the release build used Java8 because it protects against runtime library changes (we have one currently about tools.jar).\r\n\r\nI'd like the build to work with Java11 - hence the commented line in the parent `pom.xml` and the Jenkins job, both of which came out of the project discussions from Feb.

In the command line tool for executing SPARQL* queries (see [`ExecuteSPARQLStar` in RDFstarTools](https://github.com/RDFstar/RDFstarTools/blob/master/src/main/java/se/liu/ida/rdfstar/tools/ExecuteSPARQLStar.java)).\r\n\r\nHow? As it is done by the `TextOutput` class in Jena, plus added support for the case in which the `Node` for a variable is of type `Node_Triple` (which is possible in results of SPARQL* queries). In this case, the triple wrapped by that `Node_Triple` should be printed Turtle*-style, i.e., enclosed within `<<` and `>>`. I have already implemented the necessary extension of the `TextOutput` class: see [`TextOutputStar` in RDFstarTools](https://github.com/RDFstar/RDFstarTools/blob/master/src/main/java/se/liu/ida/rdfstar/tools/sparqlstar/resultset/TextOutputStar.java).\r\n\r\n> `QueryExecutils.outputResultSet` handles it - making `ResultSetFormatter.output(OutputStream, ResultSet, ResultsFormat)` could do the same (lookup properly for first-class results formats, and have some adapter code to handle the other ways) is one way. Would that work or you?\r\n\r\nNot really I think. I am indirectly using `QueryExecUtils.outputResultSet` already. That is, my command line tool for executing SPARQL* queries (`ExecuteSPARQLStar`) ends up in exactly that method, simply because `ExecuteSPARQLStar` extends `arq.query` (which uses `QueryExecUtils.executeQuery(Prologue, QueryExecution, ResultsFormat)`). Then, `QueryExecUtils.outputResultSet` calls `ResultSetFormatter.out(OutputStream, ResultSet, Prologue)`.\r\nThe problem is that all of these are static methods and there is no way for me to specify which `TextOutput` object should be used by `ResultSetFormatter.out(OutputStream, ResultSet, Prologue)`. I want it to use my `TextOutputStar` (see above) instead of `TextOutput`.\r\n\r\nSo, again, I think the easiest solution would be if my command line tool for executing SPARQL* queries (`ExecuteSPARQLStar`) could simply call a to-be-created method of `ResultsFormat` that allows my program to add something to `ResultsFormat.mapResultsFormatToLang`. Then, my program would simply add `ResultsFormat.FMT_TEXT` -> `ResultSetLang.SPARQLResultSetText` (which would be used only within the context of my program), and `ResultsWriter` would find and use my `ResultSetWriterFactory` (which is created and registered in [`ResultSetWritersSPARQLStar`](https://github.com/RDFstar/RDFstarTools/blob/master/src/main/java/se/liu/ida/rdfstar/tools/sparqlstar/resultset/ResultSetWritersSPARQLStar.java)). Hence, all that would be needed is to add the following code to the `ResultsFormat` class of Jena.\r\n```\r\npublic static void addResultsFormatToLangPair(ResultsFormat fmt, Lang lang) {\r\n       mapResultsFormatToLang.put(fmt, lang) ;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI believe such a method can be helpful for other use cases as well (e.g., assume someone wants to introduce a new result format language).

But I guess I might be actually missing something... other than that, +1, small change, looking good :grin: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/448982516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/449020199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/514#issuecomment-449020199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/514","id":449020199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTAyMDE5OQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-20T14:39:45Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T14:39:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My bad!

So had a try with `master`, and successfully reproduce JENA-732. See undert he `generated-sources`.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-12-30 17-55-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304786/50544587-8851cf00-0c5f-11e9-8c12-ba6eb31cfcb0.png)\r\n\r\nThen `rebased` this PR onto `master` (result plus another change here: https://github.com/kinow/jena/commits/pr-37-2). And I can confirm that the changes in this PR are still good, except for a package name that had openjena.\r\n\r\nUsing the change in this PR, my sources were generated correctly under `generated-sources/jena`. See below.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-12-30 18-17-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304786/50544593-e2529480-0c5f-11e9-8463-e870e60dc6d7.png)\r\n\r\nEven `Skos.java` which had no package. Sources used for testing available here: [https://github.com/kinow/jena-tests](https://github.com/kinow/jena-tests).\r\n\r\nHaving the generated sources in `generated-sources` is not ideal, and may break things depending on how people are packaging/building. Jenkins plug-ins put translation classes under `generated-sources/localizer`, `maven-jaxb-plugin` puts their generated sources under `generated-sources/xjc`, and so it goes.\r\n\r\nA tool that outputs sources directly to `generated-sources` could be considered wrong, I reckon, as normally each tool/plugin creates its own sub directory under `generated-sources`. At least that's my rationale for supporting the change in JENA-732, disregarding the argument that changing this could break builds/workflows (I think we should in this case, for correctness).\r\n\r\nSo I'm +1 to fix conflicts & merge it, then fix JENA-732. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\nBruno\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/450540275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/450540488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/518#issuecomment-450540488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/518","id":450540488,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDU0MDQ4OA==","user":{"login":"kinow","id":304786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow","html_url":"https://github.com/kinow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-30T05:39:19Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T05:39:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sample project that can be imported into Eclipse workspace and uses the 3.10.0-SNAPSHOT version to run with the `lang` option: https://github.com/kinow/jena-tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/450540488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/450560911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/518#issuecomment-450560911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/518","id":450560911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDU2MDkxMQ==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-30T13:30:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T13:30:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So this means we can add back the module into the build?

They see the changes as they happen. \r\n\r\nFor `RDFChanges` it is important that it is called before the local commit happens.
