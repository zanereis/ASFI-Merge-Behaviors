I'd like to revive this discussion.\r\n\r\nI think the primary use case for Livy interactive session is for notebooks (Jupyter/Zeppelin). Data Scientists type code in notebook and view results. Scheduled app submission should use Livy batches instead of sessions.\r\n\r\nLivy server garbage collect sessions without \"activity\" for a period specified by \"livy.server.session.timeout\", where \"activity\" is defined as: a) submit statement; b) cancel statement; c) complete statement; d) access REST endpoint sessions/:id/connect;\r\n\r\nThe strange thing about config \"livy.server.session.timeout\" is that it simultaneously controls two different things: 1) timeout for idle sessions (timeout since last statement completion time); and 2) max run time for a statement (timeout since last statement submission);\r\n\r\nIt will eliminate confusion if we only let \"livy.server.session.timeout\" control timeout for idle sessions, as its name properly suggests. Whether or not we want to provide \"livy.server.session.statement.maxruntime\" is a different discussion. Note that I'm not aware of a configuration to limit batch job runtime.\r\n\r\n@meisam for the scenario you described (thousands of jobs each day by enterprise scheduler), should you use Livy batch job instead of interactive sessions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/468845203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/470175947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/91#issuecomment-470175947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/91","id":470175947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDE3NTk0Nw==","user":{"login":"martinhartig","id":12610601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEwNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12610601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig","html_url":"https://github.com/martinhartig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinhartig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T16:28:33Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T16:28:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What is the \"another solution\"? \r\nCan you point me to a PR?
