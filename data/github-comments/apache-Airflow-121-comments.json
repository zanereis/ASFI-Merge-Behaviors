Reason being:\r\n\r\nWhen `clear` is called via the UI, the webserver will set the state of the LocalTaskJob to `shutdown`, this information is stored in the jobs table in the airflow metadata db.\r\n\r\nThe LocalTaskJob (which is created via `airflow run --local` command and is running in one of the workers) will heartbeat periodically, each time it will read from the db and check its own state , and once it detects that it needs to be shut down, it will attempt to \"kill\" itself, which will call the on_kill method that eventually sends a SIGTERM signal to the raw process that's doing the work... \r\n\r\nSo the main idea being, the detection of a shutdown is via the db, so it should be able to successfully terminate the running process.\r\n\r\nWould be great to have someone running CeleryExecutor or have experience with Celery to test this out.

This would break the existing DAGs but this commit can be included in 2.0. I have added documentation in `updating.md`, `integration.rst` and `code.rst` regarding the update. There were only 2 operators in `Airflow 1.9` namely: `GoogleCloudStorageDownloadOperator` and `GoogleCloudStorageToBigQueryOperator` but there has an addition of 3 more operators, hence I feel this will keep it organized and allow to add further GCS operators. Let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nAlso this is replicating the current implementation of `DataProc{*}Operators`, hence keeping consistency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/362348334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
