FYI Re: shiro and karaf\r\n\r\nIt's not finished yet (as in deployed to maven central), but this is a minimal JDBC-based user system for karaf (currently using shiro 1.3.1): https://github.com/steinarb/authservice\r\n\r\nPoints of interest:\r\n\r\n1. [uses code and OSGi service dependency injection to configure shiro](https://github.com/steinarb/authservice/blob/master/authservice.web.security/src/main/java/no/priv/bang/authservice/web/security/AuthserviceShiroFilter.java#L73) (shiro.ini can't be used, because the OSGi classloader is unable to find the shiro classes.  [The use of shiro.ini is limited to the [urls] section](https://github.com/steinarb/authservice/blob/master/authservice.web.security/src/main/resources/shiro.ini)). The injected OSGi services are Realm and Session\r\n\r\n2. [Uses liquibase to set up the schema and initial data](https://github.com/steinarb/authservice/blob/master/authservice.db.liquibase/src/main/resources/db-changelog/db-changelog-1.0.0.xml#L6), which means that it can easily be adapted to any JDBC database supported by liquibase (which is basically all of them), currently I'm using derby memory database for tests and PostgreSQL for production\r\n\r\n3. Has a JDBC realm that supports base64 encoded salt (see [SHIRO-552](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-552)) (I'm working on a pull rquest for this, but it stranded on the OSGi issues that you are currently working)\r\n\r\n4. has a very small GUI for logging in and letting users change their own passwords and email/real name (no actual frontend, just bootstrap-styled HTML delivered by jersey). There is also a jersey resource in this module that allows nginx to use shiro for authentication\r\n\r\n5. has a react application for user management, the react application's jersey backend communicates with its business logic through [this OSGi service](https://github.com/steinarb/osgi-service/blob/master/osgiservice.users/src/main/java/no/priv/bang/osgiservice/users/UserManagementService.java#L33)
