That's what I suggested earlier. I said that we don't need to care as much about the process + node + no-pref case.

I'd rather support that than add the primary argument here.\n- If we do this, then the `--primary` argument becomes relevant only for Python, and we can give it a specific name there, e.g. `--main-file`. Another option is to add `--module` and execute the `__main__` function in a specific module with `python -m module-name`. This is the more Pythonic way to do it AFAIK but it will also be more work, so I'd just stick to `--main-file` in 1.1 and add `--module` later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51137420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51137436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1751#issuecomment-51137436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1751","id":51137436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTM3NDM2","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-05T00:52:53Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T00:52:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi TD, thanks for your review, I will update the code according to your comments.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51137436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51137532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1715#issuecomment-51137532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1715","id":51137532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTM3NTMy","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-05T00:54:10Z","updated_at":"2014-08-05T00:54:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW if we do this then there's no need to special-case `spark-internal` and such, right?
