If I understand you, the issue is that background callbacks must happen in the Zookeeper thread, not CuratorFrameworkImpl's ExecutorService thread? I still don't see how this is changed by the code you posted. In order for there to be a change in behavior, a Zookeeper thread must call `CuratorFrameworkImpl.processBackgroundOperation` with a null event. If the event is not null, the behavior is unchanged.\r\n\r\nI'm having a hard time finding any instances of `CuratorFrameworkImpl.processBackgroundOperation` being called with a null event from a Zookeeper callback. The calls I can find all have a non-null event when called from inside a Zookeeper callback.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like all the calls to `processBackgroundOperation` with a null event are coming from `forPath` or equivalent (e.g. `forOperations`).

You're right the connection issues can get in the way of this. But, to me, this is all moot. This is how Curator works today and it would be very disruptive to change it now. We can't change deep behavior like this without it affecting users of the library. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604706953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/304532717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/215#issuecomment-304532717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/215","id":304532717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDUzMjcxNw==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-28T18:47:03Z","updated_at":"2017-05-28T18:47:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Too bad.
