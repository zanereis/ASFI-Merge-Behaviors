However, note that if log4j is not set up, the user will fail to see these important messages. In the new MLContext, this information shall potentially be handled differently so that Notebook users can see this information on the Notebook page rather than in a console, since it's quite possible a Notebook user will never see anything going to a console (such as log warnings).\n2) I don't think 1 potential output to standard output will clog the stdout queue.

3) well, the issue with castAsScalar was that we did not follow R's convention for these kinds of casts - internally, however, the cast prefix was very appropriate. Anyway, I don't have a strong opinion here - if the majority of people preferes the AS prefix that's fine too.\nad 4) I understand why you made that change - the only reason why I would prefer to call the flag 'conditional' is that it represents a slightly different contract: with a flag like 'doWarning' the implementation has no choice but to raise a warning instead of a exception.

First, it always assumes entire \ndense  outputs which incorrectly propagates into subsequent operations. Second, there is no overwrite with unknown values which renders it incorrect in special cases of dynamic recompilation.\n\n4) Validation: Please move any semantic validation out of the parser (DmlSyntacticValidator) and into the actual validate. \n\n5) Buffer pool: CacheableData is completely generic and should not have any references to MatrixBlock or FrameBlock, please move the reuse handling into MatrixObject or ExecutionContext.\n\n6) Reuse allocated arrays: The current reuse of allocated arrays has two major problems: (1) it is not thread-safe, and (2) it creates incorrect results for operations that assume\nzero-initialized outputs and accordingly don't overwrite each cell. Please add TODOs to fix that. \n\n7) Multi-threading - integration: Please integrate the decision on multi-threading into hops, lops, and runtime instructions. Note that the Hop should implement MultithreadedHop and requires treatment in the parfor optimizer - otherwise  the instruction would not be aware of the surrounding parfor parallelism.\n\n8) Multi-threading - error handling: Currently, there is no error handling on multi-threaded operations, which means issues would lead to silent errors and hence potentially incorrect results. Please, explicitly call a get on each future. \n\n9) Block operations: Why are the individual operations directly implemented in the instructions? Please move to MatrixBlock and potentially create a LibMatrixDNN to groups these operations together.\n\n10) Sparse operations: Currently, sparse operations would suffer an unnecessarily bad asympotic behavior as we access each cell, and each cell requires a binary search to find the value. It would be great to support both dense and sparse if these operations might be used by other usecases than pure dense inputs.\n\n11) Distributed operations: how hard would it be to add the distributed operations for Spark/MR too? If infeasible, please add least add some comments into the reprective Hop as to why\nthese operations are not added.\n\n12) Statistics: Please only maintain statistics whenever you -stats is enabled as the System.nanoTime and atomic counters can be an actual bottleneck. Also please, remove them from\nMatrixBlock to ensure they are not unnecessarily called on distributed operations. Also the new counters need to be reset on Statistics.reset.\n\n13) Tests: I would really appreciate to have the R scripts for tests as the unrolled expected results are really had to maintain and extend. In the worst case, let use at least provide these fixed expected results as CSV files. \n\n14) Codestyle: First, please move all class members to the top of the class. Second, please try to merge predicates to reduce levels of indentation (e.g., DataExpression.getMatrixParametersForTensorFn). Third, please remove the redundant opcode checks from the CP instruction. Fourth, remove commented stdout debug output. Fifth, don't use all capital names for non-constants (NON_ZEROED_DOUBLE_ARR, which is a map).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216686267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216696582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/130#issuecomment-216696582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/130","id":216696582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjY5NjU4Mg==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T23:33:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T23:33:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mboehm7 Made the updates.\n\nAll tests passed [here](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/302/).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216696582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216702195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/130#issuecomment-216702195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/130","id":216702195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjcwMjE5NQ==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T23:58:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T23:58:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry I didn't see this before, but could you please move the warning from the parsers (PydmlSyntacticValidator/DmlSyntacticValidator) into the language level (BuiltinFunctionExpression) in order to consolidate all validate-related code as the parsers are meant for pure syntactic translation and validation, not semantic like functions names and things like that.

I don't think all of these operations qualify as Reorg as some of them do more than simple reorg, for example: col2im. Also, these operations are fairly specific to tensor to be grouped as seperate Op rather than have them under ParameterizedOp. Also, just like AggregateBinaryOp, this Op can qualify for fusing/meta-optimization. For example: http://benanne.github.io/2014/12/09/theano-metaopt.html\n(2) Pooling parameters: Can you please point me to the part where I assume every parameter is a constant ? If so, it is definitely a bug and will correct it.\n(3) Yes, the output of ConvolutionCP instructions is always in dense format. We can revisit this assumption later. I can work on fixing overwriting of unknown values.\n(4) There is no semantic validation in DmlSyntacticValidator. Since SystemML doesnot support list, all we do in DmlSyntacticValidator is unfold the list.\n(5) Done.\n(6) a. Converted  non_zeroed_double_arr to ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safety of put and remove. b. If the caller calls the method \"public void allocateDenseBlock(boolean clearNNZ, boolean zeroOut)\" incorrectly (i.e. allocateDenseBlock(..., false) when the operation requires allocateDenseBlock(..., true)) then and then only it will produce incorrect results. \n(7/8) Will add the multi-threading in the next commit.\n(9) Will create LibMatrixDNN in the next commit. \n(10/11) I think we should optimize \"Sparse operations\" and \"Distributed operations\" in subsequent PR once we are happy with the performance of single node Lenet script on dense MNIST dataset. I have added respective TODO comments. \n(12) Done.\n(13) I can create a fixed expected results as CSV files in this PR and Mike can resolve issues with R port in a separate PR.\n(14) Done.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216748943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216751023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/134#issuecomment-216751023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/134","id":216751023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjc1MTAyMw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T05:50:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T05:50:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ad 2) ConvolutionOp->parseInput->extractValue throws an exception if its not a LiteralOp.

I'm going to do a few more checks on it, and then I'll either attach it here or make a PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/216995632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217001010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/136#issuecomment-217001010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/136","id":217001010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzAwMTAxMA==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T20:59:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T20:59:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All tests passed [here](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/315/).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217001010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217018598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/134#issuecomment-217018598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/134","id":217018598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzAxODU5OA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T22:08:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T22:08:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @dusenberrymw ...

I like the implementation as well -- it's simple and the mapping of namespaces to direct file paths removes confusion.  Also, I noticed that this seems to have also fixed another issue in which the namespaces imported within a file would \"leak\" out and be available to any other files.  Now, a script only has access to the namespaces that it itself imported, which is the correct behavior.  Awesome to see that patched as well, as I think that could have been some bad technical debt.\n\nAwesome work, @gweidner! 👍

Here are a couple of comments to further improve the current status:\n\n1) Hop: Keeping the separate hop is ok for isolation, but we need to be aware that this hop then needs to be treated separately in the rewrites e.g., simplify agg over reorg. If you'd like to keep this hop, please remove the state that is just used locally (because it might confuse people why this status is not part of deep copy and compare)\n\n2) Operator Selection: Please force the execution type cp, otherwise it would fail to compile\nif we are running against hadoop/spark execution modes.\n\n3) Simplify Parser: Could we please keep the syntactic parsers (dml, pydml) free of builtin function names and specific parameters. Please, move the entire code to validate (if really needed during parsing, at least let's rework this to a call to the respective expressions)\n\n4) Simplify MatrixObject: in clearReusableData, the _data member is always of type MatrixBlock - so there is no need for checks or casts.\n\n5) Simplify MatrixBlock: Please move the map for reused objects out of MatrixBlock as you anyway use it only from your CP instruction. Also let's remove the references from MatrixBlock to Statistics (having the map outside of matrixblock would simplify this too). Furthermore, you might want to think about a new operator type and methods in matrix block to surface the calls to LibMatrixDNN such that all operations are callable directly on the matrix block object.\n\n6) Correctness Runtime NNZ Maintenance: You explicitly set outputBlock.setNonZeros(numRows \\* numCols) during setup of the output blocks. This is incorrect if not all cells are represented in the output (not matter if dense or not) and if your operations call a set/get which internally increments the nnz too.\n\n7) Correctness LibMatrixDNN: In doPoolingBackward you use double maxVal = Double.MIN_VALUE; However, this is incorrect in the presence of negative values. Please use -Double.MAX_VALUE (note that Double.MIN_VALUE is the smallest double magnitude not the minimal value). Also, it would be good to use the threads as passed into the runtime, without additional calls to OptimizerUtils.\n\n8) Cleanup Tests: The calls to bHM.clear() in finalize are unnecessary as these maps are fully garbage collected.\n\n9) Code Style: Finally, there are some minor code style issues. First, please use auto-boxing instead of explicit new Integer(val) whenever possible. Second, don't unnecessarily separate declaration and value assignment (e.g., params in ConvolutionCPInstruction). Third, please remove commented code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217752913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217934096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/139#issuecomment-217934096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/139","id":217934096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzkzNDA5Ng==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T17:38:39Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T17:38:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great, thanks @mboehm7 & @asurve!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217934096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/217937193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/140#issuecomment-217937193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/140","id":217937193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzkzNzE5Mw==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T17:49:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T18:26:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mboehm7 I looked into this more.
