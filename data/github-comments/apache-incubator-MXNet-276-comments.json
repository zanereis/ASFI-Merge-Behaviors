I appreciate your assistance. However, this behavior could signal a serious bug (so perhaps someone more familiar with the python api should also take a look).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short implementation 1 (file 1) defines the network in the same name space in which the training loop occurs; implementation 2 (file 2 <training loop> which imports file 3 <network definition>) has the network in a sub-namespace and runs the network in the main name space. The network and data is the same for both implementations and thus one would assume that both implementations would have the same result.\r\n\r\nThe point of implementation 2 is a rough first step to try an encapsulate / modularize the training process for distributed training e.g. so one can just focus on defining the network and say `trained_net = run(net=my_net, num_gpus=4)`.\r\n\r\nWe see that the distributed learning works well with implementation 1, where the run time decreases as the number of gpus increase.\r\n\r\nWe see the opposite in implementation 2, where the run time increase with the number of gpus (and the base run time for 1 gpu is also greater).\r\n\r\nHence I log this as an issue / bug. \r\n\r\nIf mnist was just so small that no speed increase could be seen, then implementation should also show the same results as implementation 2.\r\n\r\nI have run, and rerun these \"experiments\" and the output is consistent \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/346660854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/346664647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8617#issuecomment-346664647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8617","id":346664647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjY2NDY0Nw==","user":{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-23T16:51:09Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T16:51:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please reopen if necessary, but I think we're just going to standardize on cmake.
