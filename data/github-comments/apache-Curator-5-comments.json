The first problem is that Curator's internal Watcher map is holding on to references. My current attempt at a fix is to add CuratorFramework.clearWatcherReferences(). My testing shows this clears most of the references. However, Guava's cache seems to be holding onto additional references that I haven't figured out yet.

I'm not sure if it's easily fixed either, because there's no guarantee that the ConnectionStateListener used by the LeaderLatch will receive a CONNECTED event, because it may be started after a connection has already been established by Curator.</p>\n\n<p>One solution would be to only call reset() in the start() method of LeaderLatch if a connection to ZooKeeper is already established, but I don't believe that it's currently possible to query the internal connection state of Curator. This information is currently only available via the ConnectionStateListener interface, and you don't find out the current state until the next state change.</p>\n\n<p>We would need to  modify the CuratorFramework interface to add a getConnectionState() method, that would return the current connection state. I think that this is pretty useful regardless, but I'm wondering if it's been thought of before and rejected for some reason.
