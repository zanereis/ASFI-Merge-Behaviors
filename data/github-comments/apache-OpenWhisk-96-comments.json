I have to create a base class and the base entities, so both CLI and REST can extend with no conflicts.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see how it looks like in further PR, go to https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/2589.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/329281578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/329282770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2646#issuecomment-329282770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2646","id":329282770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTI4Mjc3MA==","user":{"login":"akrabat","id":33135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat","html_url":"https://github.com/akrabat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T20:10:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T20:10:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Reopening as git get confused with others rebasing work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/329282770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/329295243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2689#issuecomment-329295243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2689","id":329295243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTI5NTI0Mw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T20:59:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T20:59:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For Kubernetes, we would be able to leverage the hostname of the node each Invoker is running on assuming the Invoker is running as a DaemonSet.

My understanding of kafka is superficial, but I believe that is what it provides.  Assuming it does, then the code in the Registrar agent should make exactly the same set of state updates in each controller process.  I've done a few dozen runs with multiple controllers and it seems to work, but that isn't proof (could be dumb luck still).   An alternative implementation could forgo relying on kafka and use Akka distributed data to maintain a shared counter and mapping data structure. \r\n\r\nIf the invoker dies, but restarts with the same invokerUUID it had before, it will get the same invokerId assigned to it.  The main difference from what you need to do today is that although your deployment tooling still needs to assign UUIDs, they no longer have to be dense integers.  For example the invokerUUID can be the Kube nodeName or the IP address of the node (if you only deploy 1 invoker instance per IP address) or some other arbitrary alpha-numeric string. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/329591647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
