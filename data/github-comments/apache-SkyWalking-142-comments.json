One question to all, does this plugin suppose to optional or default. How wide does routine use in kotlin? Could it have side effect as default for all coroutine?\r\n\r\n@wu-sheng \r\nI think this can be divided into four cases.\r\n\r\n### Pure Java\r\nPure java will not exist the interception point, the plugin will not be activated, maybe no additional cost with this case, just 1 class be loaded.\r\n\r\n### Kotlin but no coroutine\r\nKotlin is becoming popular in the back-end stack, because of Kotlin's practical and straightforward grammar and powerful stdlib. But most people maybe use Kotlin to instead of Java, but no more coroutines or other adv features.\r\n\r\nBut if you don't have dependent on `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core`, the interception point will not exist too.\r\n\r\n### Kotlin with coroutine in business code\r\nMaybe sometimes, people will use coroutine in their business code, and don't care about the tracing in the coroutine.\r\n\r\nIf you have no activated tracing context, it just case `ContextManager.isActive()` cost.\r\n\r\nIf you have activated tracing context in the current thread, it will cause some performance loss, about create two context snapshots, a span, and a `TracingRunnable` object.\r\n\r\n### Kotlin with coroutine stack\r\nThis is my use case. I'm using a full coroutine stack framework, and it is necessary to make the links traceable.\r\n\r\nIt will cost about create two context snapshots, a span, a `TracingRunnable` object.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570762748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570766742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4165#issuecomment-570766742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4165","id":570766742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc2Njc0Mg==","user":{"login":"devkanro","id":9367842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjc4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9367842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro","html_url":"https://github.com/devkanro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T08:19:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T08:19:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wu-sheng @kezhenxu94 \r\nIt seems like all CI passed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570766742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/570769206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4165#issuecomment-570769206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4165","id":570769206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc2OTIwNg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T09:05:53Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T09:07:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The four cases look good enough. @kezhenxu94 @arugal @dmsolr What do you think? \r\n\r\nDo we move this into the default?
