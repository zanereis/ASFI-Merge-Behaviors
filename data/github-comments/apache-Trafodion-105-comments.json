Hans, \r\nIt has been changed to one Jars with 3 soft links. I compared the Jars, true, not really needed for three.\r\n\r\nFor lib_mgmt, it's for different usage and i am not sure if it's reasonable to put it into trafodion-sql.jar.\r\nFor core/common project, i didn't see it.\r\n\r\nFor maintain, it would be more easier to find and pack trafodion-sql.jar. In the past, every a period of time, i forget the name of the folder, i have to grep to find that compilation Makefile.\r\nsqlmid means sql middware.\r\nFor replacing name, yes, we might have a new pull-request for it. Maybe, we can only change the group id.\r\n\r\nNot really needed for eclipse settings,  you can import in Eclipse which will be generated automatically, also for Intellij.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392746821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392747469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1577#issuecomment-392747469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1577","id":392747469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mjc0NzQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-29T11:45:14Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T11:45:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New

localExprs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392974607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392977671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1584#issuecomment-392977671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1584","id":392977671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mjk3NzY3MQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-29T23:13:31Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T23:13:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

@kevinxu021, thanks very much for combining the three jars into one, that makes me very happy :-).\r\n\r\nAbout the lib_mgmt jar, that is used for stored procedures. I talked to Venkat and he said it would probably be ok to combine it with the SQL jar, but we can do that another time. Sorry about the common project, my mistake, we don't have that.\r\n\r\nMy concern with putting all of our Java sources into a folder sqlmid is the same as what you mention: Forgetting or not knowing the folder name. The original idea is: Put all the Java sources for the core/sql project into folder core/sql/src, just like for any other Maven project. That seems reasonable to me. Putting the Java code for core/sql into a folder core/sql/sqlmid - then I wonder why the classes aren't called org.trafodion.sql.sqlmid. Since nobody else is commenting on this it's probably not an issue.\r\n\r\nAbout Eclipse make targets: I'm not a very experienced Eclipse user. Somehow I thought it would be a good idea to create the Eclipse .project files by running the mvn eclipse:eclipse command. See also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TRAFODION-7.\r\n\r\nSee the eclipse and sql/.project make targets in file core/Makefile. Right now the eclipse target is broken, but if you move the Java files you need to update these targets as well. Also, take a look at file core/sqf/tools/sqtools.sh. This defines a function cdj that goes to the source folder for many of the SQL Java files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392985980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392987730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1584#issuecomment-392987730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1584","id":392987730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mjk4NzczMA==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T00:03:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T00:03:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\r\nLooks good to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392987730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/392990730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1577#issuecomment-392990730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1577","id":392990730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mjk5MDczMA==","user":{"login":"venkat1m","id":12087142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3MTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12087142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m","html_url":"https://github.com/venkat1m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T00:21:21Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T00:21:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Calling it middleware seems misleading as it has udr and other utilities framework.

Query invalidation uses this mechanism too to set security invalidation keys. This is a similar model. \r\n\r\nAre Lob Locks local to a node? (I didn't see logic to propagate locks to all nodes in the cluster.) If so, how does a client know which node to talk to for a given Lob?\r\n     They are propagated. We use the mxsscp processes running on every node to propagate the lock. The executor sends a message to the mxssmp on the local node. In turn the mxssmp propagates the same lock to all mxsscps and the lock will get set in the shared segment. (see ssmpipc.cpp change ::actOnLobReq which sends the message to all sscps on each node  and sscpipc.cpp : processLobReq which sets the flag in the shared segment)  So to check the lock , the CLI can simply check if the lock is set in it's own nodes shared segment. (SQL_EXEC_CheckLobLock) \r\nIs Lob lock acquisition synchronous?\r\nWhat happens if two clients on the same node ask for a lock on the same Lob at the same time? Are we guaranteed that one of them will get the lock and the other won't?\r\n\r\nYes the RMS mechanism to set and send the message to mxssmp and mxsscps and setting in the shared segment is done under a semaphore. \r\n\r\nIt wasn't clear to me when locks are released. Do we wait until end of transaction to release the locks?\r\nThey are released after every I/O - see ExpLOB.cpp   and the call SQL_EXEC_ReleaseLobLock.

Will the transaction be doomed at that point?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/393671944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/393672012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1588#issuecomment-393672012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1588","id":393672012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzY3MjAxMg==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T20:39:12Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T20:39:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New Check Test Started: https://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/2708/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/393672012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/393682715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1586#issuecomment-393682715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1586","id":393682715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzY4MjcxNQ==","user":{"login":"sandhyasun","id":12959766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun","html_url":"https://github.com/sandhyasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T21:14:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T21:14:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I assume since the check also has to get the semaphore,  only one of them wins.
