questions @rvesse !\n\nRight now (before this PR) one can either use a few generic, non-language-specific Analyzers: StandardAnalyzer, SimpleAnalyzer, KeywordAnalyzer and LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer. \n\nThen there is MultilingualAnalyzer, which looks at the language tag of literals and picks a language-specific Analyzer based on the language tag (falling back on StandardAnalyzer in case there's no suitable Analyzer implementation for the language). The list of language-specific Analyzers is hardwired in the implementation though.\n\nWhat this adds is a non-language-specific Analyzer that can be configured in a little bit more detail: it is possible to select a Tokenizer and zero or more TokenFilters. However, it does not look at the language tags at all and it is also limited to a few recognized Tokenizers and Filters, none of which require any special parameters.\n\nThings that were possible before:\n- use StandardAnalyzer/SimpleAnalyzer/KeywordAnalyzer for everything\n- use EnglishAnalyzer for \"en\" and FrenchAnalyzer for \"fr\" literals (MultilingualAnalyzer does this)\n\nThings that become possible with this PR:\n- use KeywordTokenizer (i.e. don't split into tokens), but drop accents with ASCIIFoldingFilter and make everything lowercase with LowerCaseFilter (my original use case for JENA-1058)\n- use WhitespaceTokenizer without filters (perhaps good for handling e.g. a whitespace-separated list of product codes or URIs)\n- dozens of other combinations of the non-language-specific Tokenizers and TokenFilters, though probably only some combinations make any sense\n\nThings that are still not possible:\n- use EnglishAnalyzer for \"en\" language but StandardAnalyzer for everything else (in MultilingualAnalyzer the analyzers are hardwired)\n- use language-specific analyzers when available but fall back on SimpleAnalyzer (ditto, the fallback to StandardAnalyzers in hardwired in MultilingualAnalyzer)\n- use StandardAnalyzer with LengthFilter to remove excessively short or long words (LengthFilter requires `min` and `max` parameters and there is no way to pass those parameters to ConfigurableAnalyzer, so it doesn't support LenghtFilter)\n\nIn short, the universe of Analyzers (Tokenizer + TokenFilter combinations, with or without special treatment for language tags) is potentially huge and this PR tackles only one rather small part of it, but it expands the options in a way that I think is useful.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/153981033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/154063083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/97#issuecomment-154063083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/97","id":154063083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDA2MzA4Mw==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T13:50:56Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T13:50:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ajs6f You're right, I did that now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/154063083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/154092054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/97#issuecomment-154092054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/97","id":154092054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDA5MjA1NA==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T15:22:57Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T15:22:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ajs6f for your detailed notes!

It runs using the suite runner to operate all the tests inside it, and it definitely gets called by `TestInMemory`, which itself gets linked up into `TS_Core`. \n\nI think I need to rename `TestInMemory` to `TS_InMemory` to come into line with the naming convention, right? It is responsible for testing all the machinery that together is self to implement the new in-memory dataset design, several different classes, not just `DatasetGraphInMemory` itself.\n\nI can definitely break the various things in `TestDatasetGraphInMemory` out, but given that it is currently only about 250 lines, most of which is Java formatting and boilerplate, and that most of those nested guys are just trivial subtypes of abstract dataset test classes from elsewhere, I thought it might actually be _harder_ to read broken out.  In a different language, I might use multiple concrete inheritance to clarify/simplify this, letting `TestDatasetGraphInMemory` inherit from all these various abstract test classes directly. But I'm fine either way.\n\nShall I make another commit renaming `TestInMemory` to `TS_InMemory` and breaking apart `TestDatasetGraphInMemory` to a `TS_DatasetGraphInMemory` and multiple classes like `TestDatasetGraphInMemoryThreading`, `TestDatasetGraphInMemoryLock`, etc.?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/156145087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/156146622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/94#issuecomment-156146622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/94","id":156146622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjE0NjYyMg==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-12T15:54:25Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T15:54:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It occurs to me that a better way to explain myself is: `TestDatasetGraphInMemory` looks the way it does (lots of nested classes) because I wanted to keep the usual correspondence of one-class-to-one-test-class and I needed to use the test behavior from many abstract dataset test classes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/156146622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/156148758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/94#issuecomment-156148758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/94","id":156148758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NjE0ODc1OA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-12T16:02:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-12T16:02:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is not the code - it's the way tests are found.\n\nThis is what seems to be happening - when running the JUnit tests on the package (at least in Eclipse and I believe in surefire if we didn't use \"TS_\"), `TestDatasetGraphInMemory`, `TestInMemory` and the inner class of `TestDatasetGraphInMemory` all get found and run.

Should I file a ticket to remind us to write those with all the copious spare time we have :) , or did I just miss them?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/157728485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/157888536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/100#issuecomment-157888536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/100","id":157888536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Nzg4ODUzNg==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T22:42:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T22:42:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"IIRC `LockMRSW` gets tested with `TestConcurrency` and when used with `TestDatasetGraphWithLock`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/157888536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/158076981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/100#issuecomment-158076981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/100","id":158076981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODA3Njk4MQ==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-19T14:45:43Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T14:45:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And the various `Assembler` subtypes?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/158076981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/158089384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/100#issuecomment-158089384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/100","id":158089384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODA4OTM4NA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-19T15:26:33Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T15:26:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Most Assemblers are tested in jena-core.

And it's nice to have a patch which actually _reduces_ the amount of code quite significantly!\n\nI'm a bit worried about the readability aspect here though. There are some techniques in here that are unfamiliar to me - having learnt Java more than a decade ago, around the time of JDK 1.4, and mostly avoiding Java in favor of other programming languages ever since (though I have picked up some techniques on the way at least up to Java 6). Using modern, clean and efficient techniques is good, but how modern can you be and still have people understand the code?\n\nFor example, the way you replaced the TextHitConverter class with a [forEach expression](https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/101/files#diff-48122cd8c64b1e120b37581f50fc55ceR252) - I didn't even know such a syntax existed! I do like getting rid of the converter class, but is this a style we want to encourage? It looks a bit like typical jQuery code to me, with all the (nested) callbacks...\n\nWhat do others feel? @afs?\n\nAlso in terms of code review, it would be easier to take this one piece (commit) at a time, with descriptive commit messages, instead of everything in one lump.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/158932591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/158933847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/101#issuecomment-158933847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/101","id":158933847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODkzMzg0Nw==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T13:31:21Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T13:32:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Maybe there's confusion about what this PR is for-- I wasn't intending that it would be merged, but that you would use it as a source of examples, like I wrote.

This mean the lock is taken once at the finishing of a transaction.\n- Reorganises the code to a rigid pattern for operations.\n- Renames `commitLock` as `systemLock`\n- Uses `ReentrantLock`, not `ReentrantReadWriteLock` (only the write lock was used; the implement of a `ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock` and `ReentrantLock` is much the same for our usage, just calls to the `sync` object).\n\nAs well as code review, design review would be appreciated.  Compared to the original design, this makes `abort` take a lock and call `abort` on indexes whereas previously it simply did nothing, knowing the index implementations would cope.  Because `abort` is a not a performance critical operation (usually!), the symmetric and explicit calls to index operations makes things clearer in my view.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/164159785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/164196267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/107#issuecomment-164196267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/107","id":164196267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDE5NjI2Nw==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T21:49:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T21:49:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This PR has become mixed in with Jena master evolution.

If I understand correctly where you're taking this, we have a lock that must be acquired to change transactional state (for example, to commit) but can be released as soon as that is accomplished (`systemLock`) and a lock that must be held as long as a transaction is in progress (`writeLock`). `transactionLock` does sound like a better name for the latter, especially since it's held by readers, too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/164426433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/164436772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/109#issuecomment-164436772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/109","id":164436772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDQzNjc3Mg==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T13:30:20Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T13:30:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think this is basically awesome.
