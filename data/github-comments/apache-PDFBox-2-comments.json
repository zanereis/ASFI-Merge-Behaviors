If we need the same parser every time, then we can add one parameter instead of two to the getFontAtIndex method. I don't know this algorithm well, so if you think we only need one parser for each method (getFontByName and processAllFonts), that's ok. The goal is to reduce the number of memory allocations because it is slow. Therefore it looks strange.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/comments/792022230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/comments/792026731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/pull/107#issuecomment-792026731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/107","id":792026731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MjAyNjczMQ==","user":{"login":"valerybokov","id":67366451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzY2NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67366451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov","html_url":"https://github.com/valerybokov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-06T19:03:59Z","updated_at":"2021-03-06T19:03:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@THausherr : The one about the double-checked-locking I'll do after the next release.
