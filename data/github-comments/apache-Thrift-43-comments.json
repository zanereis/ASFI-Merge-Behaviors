UpdateKnownMessageSize(long size);\r\n        public abstract void CheckReadBytesAvailable(long numBytes);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOT has its own TTransport (for some reason): https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/master/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Jaeger/Implementation/InMemoryTransport.cs\r\n\r\nIs there guidance somewhere on how to implement the `UpdateKnownMessageSize`/`CheckReadBytesAvailable` API?\r\n\r\nMy hope here was a small patch to 0.13.X for people on the existing API using it in high-volume scenarios and then also put into master

It seems to have mistakenly been published using https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/js/package.json when all prior versions were published using https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/package.json, which properly includes and references both the browser and Node.js runtimes in ways that browser and Node.js builds can both understand. I am guessing that this mistaken publishing happened first, prompting this PR, when the real fix would be to republish with the correct package.json at the root.\r\n\r\nThis has broken all Node.js projects using Thrift for the past several months - for instance, the 'hello.js' example included in the npm Readme. But everything Node trying to require 'thrift' after installing it via npm will get the same error regardless:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ Error: Cannot find module 'thrift'\r\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:582:15)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:508:25)\r\n    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:637:17)\r\n    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:22:18) code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you please republish 0.13.0 immediately to correct this?

IIRC this will break then compatibility with NET Framework. That's why we reset it to 2.0.\r\n\r\nYour recall is 100% spot-on, that's why I didn't _change_ the target, I _added_ one. Subtle, but important difference. The library is now targetting .NET Standard 2.0 & .NET Standard 2.1 at the same time. When you compile you get 2 DLLs, one for each. Both can be included in the NuGet and then consumers can use whichever they support.\r\n\r\nYou can see this right now in practice in the Benchmark project. It is a Console app (EXE) multi-targeting .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET Core 3.1. When compiled, two exes. One will use the .NET Standard 2.0 path and the other .NET Standard 2.1.\r\n\r\nThe idea being, we support people on older versions but if you are using .NET Core 3+, we can take advantage of the performance improvements available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/598822999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/599003110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1973#issuecomment-599003110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1973","id":599003110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTAwMzExMA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-14T03:11:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T03:11:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
