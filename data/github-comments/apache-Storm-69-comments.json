We use zookeeperAuthInfo which adds topology.owner payload as auth than sets the ACL's on /transactional nodes as \"sasl:storm\" also the digest . When the user kills  we don't erase /transactional data upon killing of a topology. After user re-deploys the topology even if its the same user the auth digest will change and which will cause it thrown an ACL exception when trying to access previous transactional data.</p>\n\n<p>1) add topology_name under /transactional . currenlty it uses /transacational/spou1 . <br/>\n2) delete /transactional/topology_name data if user kills a topology.</p>\n\n<p>deleting the /transactional nodes probably not a good option . Since most users if they are upgrading they will kill a topology and upgrade storm cluster and re-deploy the topology .

During slaves check the znode, it will sync binary from master.\n2. All client API firstly connection ZK and get to know who are the nimbus Master.\n\n(1) The core code in

I respect your experience with this, especially since this is your third iteration on the code.  ZK load is a big issue and concern for me so I am all for trying to adopt what JStorm has done in the area of HA.  Because we are working on a separate feature branch for this, where we can break APIs if need be, perhaps we can check in the code as it is now, and file a follow on JIRA to adopt the model, configs, and ideally some of the code that JStorm is using.

noopener\">http://www.slideshare.net/hustjackie/jstorm-introduction</a></p>\n\n<p>Why we start merge ?<br/>\n(1) in a long term, Java core will bring more contributors, make Storm evolve faster.<br/>\n(2) the goal both Storm and JStorm are almost same, let's work together to reduce  duplication of effort.<br/>\n(3) Alibaba JStorm Team are one of the most experienced teams in this field, they can bring lots of JStorm enhancement changes to Storm.<br/>\n(4) There are hundreds of application in Alibaba running on JStorm, which can help to verify one RC version Storm, this will reduce release period.<br/>\n(5) We can have a try to unify offline and online programming framework, merge Spark framework, some more challenege things.</p>\n\n<p>The target of merge:<br/>\n(1) Storm application can still be run without change user code after merge.</p>\n\n<p>The problem are: <br/>\n(1) The work of merging is huge, it will take much effort of two communities, especially for some design discussion.Fortunately JStorm communities will take charge of this task.<br/>\n(2) The period of Storm with both clojure core and java core maybe long, it is the biggest release since Storm release, it need more time to test.</p>\n\n\n<p>I think all difficult of merge can be resolve, the only problem is how long we resolve them.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612532102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612532222","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4559#issuecomment-2612532222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4559","id":2612532222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MzIyMjI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-24T17:06:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:28:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
