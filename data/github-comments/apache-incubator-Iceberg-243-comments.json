But that's not so much as a workaround as recovery once it happens.\r\n\r\nConsidering the missing metadata failure condition is pretty easy to detect in code once it happens via catching `NotFoundException`, it would technically be possible to automate this fix and then retry the job, though you would have to be careful not to change anything else in the Glue Table metadata in the process to be safe.\r\n\r\nAs for a workaround that avoids ending up in this situation in the first place, some potential options besides my pending upstream fix are to:\r\n1. Set the Catalog Option [`s3.delete-enabled`](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/aws/#s3-tags) to `false` so the step that actually corrupts the table becomes a no-op. If you do this though, you will Orphan any files you attempt to the system attempts to delete/expire, so make sure you don't have that option set in whatever context you use to [DeleteOrphanFiles](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/maintenance/#delete-orphan-files).\r\n2. If you want to use the prior option but limit what gets Orphaned, you can potentially extend [S3FileIO](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/aws/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/s3/S3FileIO.java) with a version where `deleteFile` no-ops for metadata files, then specify that modified version of S3FileIO for your `io-impl` parameter.\r\n1. Provide a [custom AWS Client factory](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/aws/#aws-client-customization) that disables API retries for the Glue API client. The downside, as documented earlier, is:\r\n> This hurts reliability in normal usage to an unacceptable degree.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1494931953/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1494934603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7151#issuecomment-1494934603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7151","id":1494934603,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85ZGuRL","user":{"login":"ChristinaTech","id":6320689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjA2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6320689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristinaTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristinaTech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-03T20:25:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-03T20:25:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@c0d3monk As for whether a patch can be expected for the 0.14.x version.

By adding specific table properties we are forcing a particular implementation. I don't think it is a good idea. In my view, it is OK for vendors to provide their own implementations and Iceberg as a library should allow those implementation to plug in. That means if the Iceberg repo needs to adapt to inject extra metrics reporters during writes or if we need another AutoOptimize API to make this happen, we should do it. However, this seems too specific to AWS to live in the Iceberg repo directly. When we created actions, the assumption was that we would share common table management blocks but we won't force how those blocks are used/triggered.\r\n\r\nWe could discuss some form of auto optimize API that would kick in after writes (sync or async) and use the same cluster and resources. That could make sense but starting an async compaction job on EMR seems too specific to live here directly.\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n- Is the existing metrics reporter API sufficient to build external auto optimize?

No need to rely on to_pandas which may incur additional overhead.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a great first step. The important part is that we push down the predicate from Polars into PyIceberg.

I think that would be a great second step, but would probably be a bit more complex. We don't integrate in the way with arrow that would be ideal, but we're working on this (probably would take some time).
