At least we could add some commentary to the code.  The specific problems, in my view, are:\r\n1. A filename is transmitted from client -> AM -> TM in the env variable `_KEYTAB_PATH` but the value doesn't appear to be used.   In effect it is a flag asserting that a keytab named `krb5.keytab` is available.  Alternatives:\r\n  a. Use `krb5.keytab` as the value.\r\n  b. Eliminate the env check and simply look for the file; if present, use it.\r\n2. The existence of the \"integration test code\" has an unclear purpose.   It mutates the Hadoop configuration, why?   Is the code active in any production scenario?\r\n\r\nNote that `YarnTaskExecutorRunner` implements this in a slightly different way, and should be re-tested for 1.5.0 (since I don't think it is in use yet).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/352531436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/352564245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5121#issuecomment-352564245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5121","id":352564245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjU2NDI0NQ==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-18T21:33:18Z","updated_at":"2017-12-18T21:33:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ankitiitb1069 @ggevay for the work and review.\r\nThe changes LGTM, minus my comment.

It mainly contains the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Do some minor refactors in `UpdatingPlanChecker`, `NonWindowInnerJoin` and tests\r\n- As for indicator attributes\r\n  - Event-time attributes are considered to be not supported. When executing the join, the join operator needs to make sure that no late data is emitted. Window join makes it possible by holding back watermarks, but non-window join is unbounded, so we don't know how much to hold back. \r\n  - Proctime attributes are supported to be outputted from join but can not exist in join predicate. It seems there is no easy way to support proctime attributes in join predicate. If we evaluate proctime in code generator, left proctime will always equals right proctime, which makes `left.proctime > right.proctime` always return false. Currently, users can cast proctime attributes to long type if they want to do predicate.

Given that the configuration parameter hints towards the TaskManager only, we should maybe rename it? Additionally, I just noticed that our Yarn/Mesos startup of the JobManager does not adapt `taskmanager.tmp.dirs` as it does for the TaskManager and this should then also be changed/fixed.\r\n\r\nRegarding [MAPREDUCE-6472](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-6472), it seems this is only available from Hadoop 2.7.2 onwards. With this fix applied, the behaviour changes only slightly: instead of using `java.io.tmpdir` directly (set to `Environment.PWD/tmp`), this will use the `taskmanager.tmp.dirs` which is set to `Environment.LOCAL_DIRS` by `YarnTaskManagerRunner`/`YarnTaskExecutorRunner`.\r\n\r\nI adapted the appropriate code paths for Mesos as well. If this is not used yet, it will at least work in the future once the `taskmanager.tmp.dirs` handling is correct. Until then, the fallback of this to `java.io.tmpdir` seems to be working as well (if this is set appropriately by Mesos) - but this is not only a problem of the BLOB server parts then and is out of the scope of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/354771095/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/354771253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5185#issuecomment-354771253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5185","id":354771253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDc3MTI1Mw==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-02T13:55:40Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T13:55:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The concept of this looks good. However, if we want to merge it I think we have to make this a standalone thing and not depend on other states because this can have unforeseen consequences for future developments. I can think of several cases where the current approach would lead to surprising problems:\r\n - a user inspects a savepoint and finds a `MapState` and a `ValueState` instead of the `ListState` they're expecting (becomes a problem when we have tools for inspecting savepoints and also is problematic for compatibility of the savepoint format between different state backends)\r\n - (related to the above) the \"binary format\" of the savepoint is different between the two list implementations. This leads to problems if you want to change the implementation between restoring from a savepoint and when you want to switch backends (which we currently don't support).\r\n - if/when we have metrics for user states this would export metrics for a `MapState` and a `ValueState` and not for one expected `ListState`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/354771253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/354776245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5192#issuecomment-354776245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5192","id":354776245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDc3NjI0NQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-02T14:22:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T14:22:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for fixing this!
