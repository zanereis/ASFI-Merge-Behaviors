There's a major issue which will surface in the unit test once I can get it integrated. I've got the test properly integrated in the grunt task. What happens it that PhantomJS doesn't like the following expression:\n\n```\nString.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array( buffer ) )\n```\n\nThis has been described here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/1955\nThe problem is, if I apply the \"fix\" mentioned in the comments, the test doesn't pass because unicode characters are decoded incorrectly. So, one way or another, the test will fail. I can see only one solution to this issue. I am going to close this pull request and provide the ThrifBinaryProtocol for JS as an external module to be added on top of Thrift library.
