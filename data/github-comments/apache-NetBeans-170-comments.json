There are two improvements that I suggest:\r\n\r\n- Bind an event to the `source` and `target` text fields: Currently, there is a warning message displayed when a path is added directly in the text field. To improve this, you can bind an event to the text fields so that the warning message is automatically removed when a path is added directly into the text fields instead of using the browse button.\r\n\r\n- Remove the package goal from the execution command: It seems that the execution command is invoking the `maven-war-plugin` unnecessarily. To optimize the command, you can remove the package goal, as it may not be required for your specific use case. This will help streamline the execution process and remove any unnecessary steps.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1613681216/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1614154073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6128#issuecomment-1614154073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6128","id":1614154073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5gNglZ","user":{"login":"govindcooperrosedigital","id":130347618,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8TyYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130347618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital","html_url":"https://github.com/govindcooperrosedigital","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/govindcooperrosedigital/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-30T05:37:30Z","updated_at":"2023-06-30T05:37:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Only HTML.\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Michael Bien ***@***.***>\r\nSent: 29 June 2023 20:46\r\nTo: apache/netbeans ***@***.***>\r\nCc: Gobind Singh Samrow ***@***.***>; Author ***@***.***>\r\nSubject: Re: [apache/netbeans] Unable to copy/cut/past the content (Issue #6128)\r\n\r\n\r\nonly in HTML files or everywhere?

Another thing is that the module currently use some classes from the implementation itself. e.g. the schema is created based on a `SchemaFactory` provided by the JSF Implementation.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll abandon this PR for now as I'm currently experimenting with another solution: I try to get the JSF implementation of the JSF version which is currently used via maven.\r\nSo for example if you use Jakarta EE 10 the module checks your local repository and if the JSF Reference Implementation is not present it will be downloaded from Maven Central. The module would still use the classes from the bundled JSF Implementation, but it would fetch the actual taglib descriptions from JSF reference implementation suited for the project.\r\n\r\nThat basically already works. Currently the question is how to handle the legacy namespaces. Per spec they're still valid. The problem is that these namespaces - at least I'm not aware of - could not be retrieved from the JSF reference implementation jar. So the module would need to define them manually and this needs a some more refactoring to do it properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1621245374/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1621296329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6096#issuecomment-1621296329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6096","id":1621296329,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5gowTJ","user":{"login":"morvael","id":1133953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzM5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1133953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael","html_url":"https://github.com/morvael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T08:37:19Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T08:37:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Please do not abandon it, something it better than nothing.

am not sure about this tbh.
