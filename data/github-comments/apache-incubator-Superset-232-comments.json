The unknown and\r\ndual license need some digging to determine what they are. chardet, the\r\nLGPL one, is not ok.\r\n...\r\n\r\n>From: Maxime Beauchemin\r\n@community, it'd be great if someone could volunteer to do this (making\r\nthe python library \"requests\" an optional dependency). It appears it's used\r\nin its simplest form in a few places (requests.get) which should be easy to\r\nreplace with urrlib2. The Druid connector uses a more advanced feature\r\n(basic auth), but that could be made just an optional dependency, as we're\r\ndeprecating the Druid connector, to be replaced by the SQLAlchemy Druid\r\nconnector/dialect. There it's just a matter of moving `pydruid` and\r\n`requests` to the \"extra_requires\" section of our setup.py, and doing late\r\nimports.\r\n...\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/500747326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/500756208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7685#issuecomment-500756208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7685","id":500756208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDc1NjIwOA==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-11T09:09:03Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T09:09:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Label Bot is not confident enough to auto-label this issue.
