There are few differences in our implementations and I'm open to removing my take on it if we decide this version is better.\r\n\r\nKey differences are I use full instead of tile and I don't special case when initially parsing the nodes to extract inputs. Using full requires a static shape instead of a dynamic one so I use infer_value to convert the input. The trade-off is that my implementation is likely a little slower to convert but will be faster during inference.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546077101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546082257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4174#issuecomment-546082257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4174","id":546082257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjA4MjI1Nw==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-24T20:10:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T20:10:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, indeed the fix was applied outside of this repo; and results in no changes necessary on this one.

So this PR, and the sub-PR about fixing the tutorial target full backward compatibility, using the `tf.compat.v1` APIs for now. Having said and done so, a couple comments:\r\n\r\n* The new annotations like `@tf.function` really change a lot of syntax, and maintaining a single script for both 1.x and 2.x would be a pain for developers and users. We can detect at runtime what TF version is packaged, and switch script accordingly (e.g. a facade `from_tensorflow` module that loads the right implementation) (well, same as @srkreddy1238's point (2)).\r\n* Does it matter anyway?

Comparing to the full auto-tuning result could definitely be interesting, but it is time-consuming since the tuning space is the order of 10^5 for each op. I'll further study the tuning space coverage in the short future for sure, along with the dynamic shape codegen supports. (In fact, this RFC is more like a side application during the process of dynamic shape codegen investigation 😄 )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546220405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546348622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4201#issuecomment-546348622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4201","id":546348622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjM0ODYyMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T13:14:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T13:14:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting the problem, the community uses the discuss forum for troubleshooting please open a new troubleshooting thread on https://discuss.tvm.ai ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546348622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546348774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4200#issuecomment-546348774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4200","id":546348774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjM0ODc3NA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T13:14:27Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T13:14:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Good catch, please feel free to open a new PR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546348774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/546362936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4188#issuecomment-546362936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4188","id":546362936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjM2MjkzNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T13:52:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T13:52:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the proposal.
