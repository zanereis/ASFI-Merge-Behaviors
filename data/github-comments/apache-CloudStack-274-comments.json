There is so much code here to implement all of these new features and it all has to work alongside the old code, so sometimes it's easier to change as little as possible from the old code to \"assure\" yourself you haven't broken any of it along the way. Of course, as you do this, the new code placed on top of the old code ends up adding complexity. At some point, it's best to \"suck it up,\" sit down, and rewrite a bunch of it to support the entire feature set, but be less complicated. To do this, though, it's nice to have a large set of automated tests to catch anything you might have broken in the code during the rewrite. I do have a lot of new tests to catch issues in the new code, but I've never been super confident in CloudStack's automated tests related to its legacy features.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/355701751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/355706246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2295#issuecomment-355706246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2295","id":355706246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTcwNjI0Ng==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-06T00:40:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-06T00:40:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<b>Trillian
