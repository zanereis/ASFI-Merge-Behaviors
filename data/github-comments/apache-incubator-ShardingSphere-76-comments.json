The root cause of this issue is that we can't get tableName by columnIndex correctly.\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get sharding encryptor.\r\n     * \r\n     * @param columnIndex column index\r\n     * @return sharding encryptor\r\n     * @throws SQLException SQL exception\r\n     */\r\n    public Optional<ShardingEncryptor> getShardingEncryptor(final int columnIndex) throws SQLException {\r\n        final String actualColumn = resultSetMetaData.getColumnName(columnIndex);\r\n        if (null == sqlStatementContext) {\r\n            return Optional.absent();\r\n        }\r\n        final Collection<String> tableNames = sqlStatementContext.getTablesContext().getTableNames();\r\n        for (String each : tableNames) {\r\n            Optional<ShardingEncryptor> result = findShardingEncryptorWithTable(actualColumn, each);\r\n            if (result.isPresent()) {\r\n                return result;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return Optional.absent();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe complete code is [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/blob/dev/sharding-core/sharding-core-execute/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/core/execute/sql/execute/result/QueryResultMetaData.java#L151). You can see SS try to get encryptor with all tableNames in sqlStatementContext, so we can't get encryptor correctly by same column name. \r\nI think maybe **we should discuss the issue until get a perfect solution.**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/546600331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/546601183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2920#issuecomment-546601183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2920","id":546601183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjYwMTE4Mw==","user":{"login":"sluk3r","id":6405801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDU4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6405801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r","html_url":"https://github.com/sluk3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sluk3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-26T13:08:31Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T13:08:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ustbyjy  Hi, would you please give the schema of the tables, in order to reproduce the issue.
