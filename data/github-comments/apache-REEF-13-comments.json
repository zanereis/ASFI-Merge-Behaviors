concerned about the size of this change. Not in terms of lines changed, but lines added. This basically replicates the whole group communications code. While that is acceptable as a first step, it would be a troubling end state from a maintenance perspective, as we likely also replicate bugs :-)\n\nHence, let's try to reduce the amount of replicated code and functionality:\n- I don't see why the topologies would have to exist twice. A tree is a tress, independent of what serialization scheme is used on its edges, right? What is the impossibility overcome by replicating it?\n- The new API seems to be a generalization of the old one. Hence, we should be able to have only _one_ implementation. The _old_ APIs are then implemented on top of the _new_ ones.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/106600600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/106630289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/196#issuecomment-106630289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/196","id":106630289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjYzMDI4OQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-28T23:44:00Z","updated_at":"2015-05-28T23:44:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[Reef-pull-request-ubuntu #511](https://builds.apache.org/job/Reef-pull-request-ubuntu/511/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/106630289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/106643526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/196#issuecomment-106643526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/196","id":106643526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjY0MzUyNg==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T00:52:13Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T00:52:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks good.
