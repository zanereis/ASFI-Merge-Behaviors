 Sorry for the delay.  I believe, when you make a coprocessor call it can raise two exceptions\r\nServiceException and Throwable.   My understanding is the ServiceException is retryable, while Throwable exception is the wrapper for the exception raised in the coprocessor code, which may or may not be retryable.  The coprocessor code can also return an exception in the response as a text. See TransactionManager.java for details. \r\n\r\nI haven't tested this understanding fully. \r\n\r\nAre you assuming that ret would be null in case of ServiceException? In that case, the ServiceException would be caught and would never be retried.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/397651523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/397712385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1607#issuecomment-397712385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1607","id":397712385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzcxMjM4NQ==","user":{"login":"sandhyasun","id":12959766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun","html_url":"https://github.com/sandhyasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T18:54:48Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T18:54:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

are right, I did not see your earlier reply with the explanation. Please add this explanation to the code, because I think it helps to understand the fix. I looked at method NestedJoin::genWriteOpLeftChildSortReq(), and that code has an if statement marked \"fix for soln 10-090826-4155\". I assume that we get into this if statement and that we want to make sure that this if statement will produce an output.\r\n\r\nIt looks like your fix is only needed when the underlying table has a SYSKEY? You could add that check, but just adding the comment will help tremendously, since people can then find the place where the generated output is needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/398442288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/398446106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1581#issuecomment-398446106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1581","id":398446106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODQ0NjEwNg==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-19T15:42:15Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T15:42:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Once you add the explanation as a comment, I am +1 on this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/398446106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/398501985","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1606#issuecomment-398501985","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1606","id":398501985,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODUwMTk4NQ==","user":{"login":"sureshsubbiah","id":3596671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshsubbiah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-19T18:37:21Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T18:37:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.
