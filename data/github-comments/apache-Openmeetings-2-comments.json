All files that packages install are read-only by definition. All writable locations have to be configurable, which usually include:\r\n* config files location (/usr/local/etc/{pkg-name}.conf)\r\n* database location (/var/db/{pkg-name})\r\n* logs location (/var/log/{pkg-name})\r\n* cache location (/var/cache/{pkg-name})\r\n\r\nThe user installs a package with ```pkg install openmeetings```.

All I am doing is making the port for OM properly, as good as it is possible.\r\n\r\nImagine that some non-technical organization would like to use OM. Currently they need to hire somebody who would know how to build and configure OM. With the package - there is no need to hire people just for this.\r\n\r\nCurrently only Arch linux has the OM package: https://repology.org/project/openmeetings/versions And it isn't made properly, IMO. It runs OM as root, doesn't separate read-only from writable, etc.\r\n\r\nIdeally, all systems should have packages for your software if your want people to use it easily, so it should look more like https://repology.org/project/tor/versions\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/comments/504553076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/comments/507010185","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openmeetings/issues/29#issuecomment-507010185","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openmeetings/issues/29","id":507010185,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzAxMDE4NQ==","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-30T05:54:26Z","updated_at":"2019-06-30T05:54:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @yurivict,\r\n\r\nsorry for the silence, was busy on some personal stuff\r\nI tried to add support for SQLite DB,\r\nIt fails due to some incompatibilities,\r\n\r\nCould you try latest 5.0.0-M2 build?
