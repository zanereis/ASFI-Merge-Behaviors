It was discussed a year ago and recommended to be removed. One big issue is that depending on the backing FS, the update of the current file contents is \"eventual\".  This can lead to incorrect state being returned.\r\n\r\nRegarding `#1` above, do you have any numbers that show what the performance is for listing the state files?  Also, what state store implementation are you using.  If it is the FS version, what backing FS is it?\r\n\r\nFor `#2` I would recommend that we have a different mechanism for moving to a prior state.  This is a good feature, but rewriting the current file seems to be the wrong was to go about this.\r\n\r\nAs for `#3`, it seems that the need to write a current pointer or not is totally dependent on the filesystem which is used to store the state.  Why not get rid of the concept of current outside of the state store and allow implementations to use it or not.  At least that way, I can make an implementation of FsStateStore that doesn't use current and the builtin version can.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/282536560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/282542372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/965#issuecomment-282542372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/965","id":282542372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjU0MjM3Mg==","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-26T08:58:35Z","updated_at":"2017-02-26T08:58:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For 1, we are using FS state store on HDFS. I'm less concerned about this case than case 3 on NFS. As long as we retain only a small number of jst files per dataset it will probably be okay since it will probably add at most a few seconds to the startup of a job.\r\n\r\nFor 2, I'll have to check with the team since this is the current method of temporarily moving state back.\r\n\r\n3 is a concern for us since the NFS system we are on is less scalable than HDFS. I'm seeing delete of small files giving only 50 ops/s. Listing should be faster, but with many concurrent jobs starting it may saturate our NFS filer. We only have a single master node in this mode that does job planning, so saving CPU cycles is more essential.\r\n\r\nThe base state store interface doesn't know about current.jst (at least before your changes). We have other uses of StateStore that stores non .jst files.  The current.jst is a DatasetStateStore concept. So maybe it makes more sense to add the functionality you need to a new variation of FsDatasetStateStore that doesn't make use of the current file. I think you can even add it as a config option to the current FsDatasetStateStore since it should only be a few blocks that are different. In either case, the mysql and zk dataset state stores won't need to be touched. This allows us to continue using current.jst while users of S3 can use the new approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/282542372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/282658780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1656#issuecomment-282658780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1656","id":282658780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjY1ODc4MA==","user":{"login":"abti","id":69499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti","html_url":"https://github.com/abti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T08:38:21Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T08:38:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Trivial changes, self approving.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/282658780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/282833962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/1657#issuecomment-282833962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1657","id":282833962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjgzMzk2Mg==","user":{"login":"aditya1105","id":20373170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzczMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20373170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya1105","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T19:56:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T19:56:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Trivial.
