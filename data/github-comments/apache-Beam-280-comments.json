However I see two issues here from IOITs point of view:\r\n- suppose I add the `detectClassPathResourcesToStage()` method to fill up the worker's classpath. Such method will be able to find only production code's classes, not test ones, right? This won't be useful when running IOITs - there are lots of test classes to be found too (E.g: [this](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/common/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/common/HashingFn.java) won't be picked up, because it's a purely test code). \r\nThis is why I wanted to pass jars directly through a pipeline option: one shaded uber jar with production code, and the other with test code.\r\n- In Flink and Dataflow options `filesToStage` are `JsonIgnore`'d. AFAIK this means that those can be set only programatically, not from a command line pipeline option (--filesToStage). This also blocks IOITs because there's no way to pass the test jar. \r\n\r\nA solution that i think _might_ work and be even better is to:\r\n - change the name to `filesToStage` - it fits well\r\n - not add the `@jsonIgnore` annotation to this pipelineOption so that we are able to append new jars (those jars that cannot be detected)\r\n - *always* _detectClassPathResourcesToStage()_ before starting the runner but merge returned list of paths to resources with jars that were passed through a pipeline option.\r\n\r\nI think this way we will be able to automatically detect production code, and \"append\" test code using a pipeline option.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of that solution? Or maybe there's a simpler way to \"autodetect\" the test code?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/351456638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/351491568","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4248#issuecomment-351491568","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4248","id":351491568,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTQ5MTU2OA==","user":{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-13T19:10:49Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T19:10:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"retest this please","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/351491568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/351491845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4253#issuecomment-351491845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4253","id":351491845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTQ5MTg0NQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-13T19:11:53Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T19:11:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The last time I messed with RAT config, I thought I learned that it does read `.gitignore`.
