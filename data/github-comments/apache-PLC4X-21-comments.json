I would also like to see a recording of that ... because Mokka7 doesn't at all respect the PDU size ... they do hard-coded checks like the \"num of items <= 20\" which is too big for an s7-1200 and way too small for an S7-1500. And having a look at the C# implementations I see the same hard-coded limitations. Possibly the driver auto shrinks the request to the max possible (or a hard-coded limit) and doesn't return the full 3000 bytes. But I'm the first to admit I was wrong if I see a recording.\r\n\r\nI think it really depends on the type of data you are reading ... when reading bytes of bits, it's I think 12 for an S7-1200 ... however if there's a string in it that already might be too much. The current driver keeps on adding items until adding the next would exceed the size in the request or in the expected response, as soon as it would exceed, it creates a new message and keeps on adding items until this is also full.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately adding one item that already exceeds is something the driver currently can't handle. In the old version of the driver (prior to the mspec versions) I had some hard-coded code in there to rewrite items and join them later. I never ported that back as I was expecting a more general purpose optimizer, but I think that's not going to come. So if anyone wants to get his hands dirty, that old code could help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2298920073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2299172797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1734#issuecomment-2299172797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1734","id":2299172797,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86JCpe9","user":{"login":"lzago","id":397475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQ3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/397475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago","html_url":"https://github.com/lzago","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzago/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-20T15:44:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T16:08:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @chrisdutz \r\nthey are bytes, i read the area of bytes and then i tag on the client the chunk of bytes from the buffer to get the values, real or int. \r\nI need to read the plc 1 time per sec, so it would\r\n be too slow to read more than 1000 tags singularly in a multivar approach.

The issue always occurs when the channel lifetime is about to expire, and the secure channel should be renewed. For example, when I set the channel lifetime to 1 minute, the problem occurs within that 1-minute period. This is one reason I believe it’s not related to resource leaks, as mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1364).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I tried adding `tcp.keep-alive` in hopes of facilitating the reconnection, but it’s still not working. Unfortunately, I’m still unable to pinpoint where the error is coming from.\r\n\r\n3. When I check the Prosys OPCUA simulator logs, I can see that it doesn’t attempt to renew the connection; instead, it just closes the channel. Do I need to enable something in the simulator? I’m attaching the logs for your reference.\r\n\r\n```\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:55.596 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-2]      com.prosysopc.ua.stack.transport.tcp.nio.f  [] - OpcTcpServer(opc.tcp(/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0]:53530, (opc.tcp://Yoshi.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530 [[http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#None,None]])(opc.tcp://Yoshi.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer [[http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#Basic256Sha256,SignAndEncrypt]]))): /10.1.10.92:47938 connected\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:56.502 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-4]      com.prosysopc.ua.stack.transport.tcp.nio.f  [] - OpcTcpServer(opc.tcp(/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0]:53530, (opc.tcp://Yoshi.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530 [[http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#None,None]])(opc.tcp://Yoshi.lab.mtu-digilab.io:53530/OPCUA/SimulationServer [[http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#Basic256Sha256,SignAndEncrypt]]))): /10.1.10.92:47950 connected\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:57.376 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-8]                   com.prosysopc.ua.stack.cert.d  [] - CRL initialized from C:\\Users\\gustavo.schewinski\\.prosysopc\\prosys-opc-ua-simulation-server\\PKI\\CA\\issuers\\crl\\ca.crl: no revoked certificates\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:57.432 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-8]                   com.prosysopc.ua.stack.cert.d  [] - CRL initialized from C:\\Users\\gustavo.schewinski\\.prosysopc\\prosys-opc-ua-simulation-server\\PKI\\CA\\issuers\\crl\\ca.crl: no revoked certificates\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:57.444 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-8]                   com.prosysopc.ua.stack.cert.d  [] - CRL initialized from C:\\Users\\gustavo.schewinski\\.prosysopc\\prosys-opc-ua-simulation-server\\PKI\\CA\\issuers\\crl\\ca.crl: no revoked certificates\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:57.451 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-8]                   com.prosysopc.ua.stack.cert.d  [] - CRL initialized from C:\\Users\\gustavo.schewinski\\.prosysopc\\prosys-opc-ua-simulation-server\\PKI\\CA\\issuers\\crl\\ca.crl: no revoked certificates\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:57.460 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Non-Blocking-Work-Executor-8]                   com.prosysopc.ua.stack.cert.d  [] - Certificate '332E73BEB6F91AD8A6779EDB866FDFE332F3DE09' added to trusted certificates.\r\n08/21/2024 09:27:57.486 INFO  [OPC-UA-Stack-Blocking-Work-Executor-1]      com.prosysopc.ua.stack.transport.tcp.nio.h  [] - SecureChannel opened;

Issue comes from application protocol and some gap in our implementation of security protocol. Below quote from the the spec:\r\n> requestType: The type of [SecurityToken](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/search/17?t=SecurityToken) request:\r\n> An enumeration that shall be one of the following:\r\n> * ISSUE_0 creates a new SecurityToken for a new SecureChannel\r\n> * RENEW_1 creates a new SecurityToken for an existing SecureChannel\r\n> secureChannelId: The identifier for the SecureChannel that the new token should belong to. This parameter shall be null when creating a new SecureChannel.\r\n\r\nThis means that for initial (issue) call, we send `0` for secure channel id, while for renewing we need to send id of channel we got earlier (you will find it in open secure channel response). I can just assume that secure channel 5 was negotiated earlier. I looked at code while writing answer, and this part of specification is satisfied.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2304317337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2304479853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1732#issuecomment-2304479853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1732","id":2304479853,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86JW5Jt","user":{"login":"gustavoschewinski","id":144673387,"node_id":"U_kgDOCJ-Kaw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144673387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavoschewinski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavoschewinski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-22T11:52:27Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T11:52:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @splatch,\r\n\r\nExactly, that is the issue.\r\n\r\nIn frame 1539, we can see that the SecureChannel ID is 5.

have tried the latest snapshot version 0.13.0-20240405.095431-1 with the code I provided initially. The function 'connection.isConnected()' is true after the connection is established, and when I simulate a disconnection, it is false. Also, the connection is automatically re-established, and isConnect() returns true after the connection is re-established. So I would say this is working fine. If I set the Netty log level to OFF, the log is not problematic either. It's still weird, but as @chrisdutz said, it's a major refactoring and as long as it doesn't affect stability, I'd say we can try version 0.13.0 when it's available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2312037427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2312277073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1593#issuecomment-2312277073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1593","id":2312277073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86J0oxR","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-27T11:15:40Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T11:15:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for confirming ... would it be ok for us to close this issue then?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2312277073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2312322511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1593#issuecomment-2312322511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1593","id":2312322511,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86J0z3P","user":{"login":"korni128","id":169154803,"node_id":"U_kgDOChUY8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/169154803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128","html_url":"https://github.com/korni128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/korni128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-27T11:37:41Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T11:37:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> would it be ok for us to close this issue then?\r\n\r\n@chrisdutz sure.
