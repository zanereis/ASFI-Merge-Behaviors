The client port address is optional, so the address is still a valid address.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that EnsembleTracker is getting the connection string for itself to Zookeeper. If it receives a config without a valid client port, then it can't create a new connection string to that client. Since Zookeeper isn't sending the clientPort configured outside of that string (in this case), we can't use any of the connection string.\r\n\r\n> I think you can just use server.addr which is guaranteed not null, and then use getHostAddress to get the hostAddress.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure about that.

This is not a problem for ZK itself because it has the knowledge of clientPort of a quorum peer which is not publicly accessible.</p>\n\n<p>    I think QuorumSever can provide APIs so you guys can use the APIs to get the client / server address / port rather than relying on the clientAddr etc fields. Before that happens it's fine to skip as there is no way to extract the client port (and I think that only happens when clientAddress is not explicitly present in the config string - cases like server.1= 125.23.63.23:1234:1235;1236)</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604755302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604755306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/912#issuecomment-2604755306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/912","id":2604755306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NTUzMDY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T04:54:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:34:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user lvfangmin commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/205#discussion_r127384661\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/205#discussion_r127384661</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: curator-framework/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/framework/imps/EnsembleTracker.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -166,12 +166,26 @@ public static String configToConnectionString(QuorumVerifier data) throws Except<br/>\n     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();<br/>\n     for ( QuorumPeer.QuorumServer server : data.getAllMembers().values() )<br/>\n     {<br/>\n    +    if ( server.clientAddr == null )<br/>\n    +    </p>\n{\n    +// Invalid client address configuration in zoo.cfg\n    +continue;\n    +    }\n<p> if ( sb.length() != 0 )</p>\n {\n     sb.append(\",\");\n }\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>InetSocketAddress address = Objects.firstNonNull(server.clientAddr, server.addr);</li>\n\t<li>sb.append(address.getAddress().getHostAddress()).append(\":\").append(address.getPort());<br/>\n    +    InetAddress wildcardAddress = new InetSocketAddress(0).getAddress();<br/>\n    +    String hostAddress;<br/>\n    +    if ( wildcardAddress.equals(server.clientAddr.getAddress()) )\n\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t\t\t<li>End diff &#8211;</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    If the clientAddr is in IPv6 format, will this equal?
