I realized a while ago that the only way any library can reliable read this device is when this library has a full schema of the device at hand. Only by following the constraints imposed by this schema can the library do the modbus calls that result in correct data.\r\n\r\nNote that the mentioned SunSpec has an even harder schema definition.\r\nFor example this field (they call it point) [`A`](https://github.com/sunspec/models/blob/master/json/model_101.json#L31) (AC Current) has a scaling factor field [`A_SF`](https://github.com/sunspec/models/blob/master/json/model_101.json#L66) which means that the value from the registers related to `A` must be multiplied by 10^`the value of the field A_SF` to get the actual value.\r\n\r\nSo to get the value of the field `A` you must read the registers related to `A` and `A_SF` before you can determine the actual value.\r\n\r\nI have been experimenting for a few months now on how to get to a form of schema definition that allows for all of these variants. I'm still working on that.\r\n\r\nSo please just treat this as an FYI around the fact that some devices show unexpected behavior if you try to read valid registers in a way that does not meet their schema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1937611549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1938216455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1186#issuecomment-1938216455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1186","id":1938216455,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85zhtYH","user":{"login":"in-fke","id":73228413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjI4NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73228413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke","html_url":"https://github.com/in-fke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/in-fke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-12T08:19:32Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T08:19:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I've just re-written the entire page .. \r\n\r\nThanks for following up on this rather quickly.\r\nQuestion remains: how to do \"tear down\" a connection pool, e.g. for shutdown / restart mechanisms.\r\nWe have a highly configurable framework and may need to \"re-deploy\" during runtime.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1938216455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1938237996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1186#issuecomment-1938237996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1186","id":1938237996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85zhyos","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-12T08:38:10Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T08:38:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There currently is no such mechanism.

option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1945630690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1945699973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1103#issuecomment-1945699973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1103","id":1945699973,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85z-QaF","user":{"login":"janb93","id":151517446,"node_id":"U_kgDOCQf5Bg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151517446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93","html_url":"https://github.com/janb93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janb93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-15T09:36:08Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T09:36:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Have

I was doing a plugin for benthos to read from ads so I wanted to use the plc4x to have support for more devices, but as for now I ended up with using the go-native-ads library which I had to modify to read TC2.. Most problem was when doing symbol lookup it returned INT16 and UINT16 instead of INT and UINT which caused it to crash.
