With\nthis delivery  all existing tests have been run and passed. This check-in,\nhowever, disables several jdbc methods mostly related to T4 row sets. We do\nnot have regression tests for these jdbc methods. Therefore, if someone\nwrites a test to use one of the disabled methods a “not supported” error is\nreturned.  The tests that fail use scroll sensitive and scroll insensitive\nrequests.\n\nI was hoping that this delivery would become the next release candidate and\nit would be submitted to Apache.  However,  a decision needs to be made if\nwe should release this with missing functionality.  We are working on\nadding these missing methods.\n\nSince this is the first Apache release, no one has built using the source\ntar file so there should not be any regressions.  Also people can still go\nto the git repository and build from the release 2.0 branch that has this\nfunctionality.  When release 1.3 is merged into 2.0, we will make sure all\nthe methods work as desired.\n\nOpinion:\n\n+1 – go ahead and release with unsupported methods\n\n0 – no opinion\n\n-1 – add code for unsupported methods\n\n```\nRoberta\n```\n\n_From:_ DaveBirdsall [mailto:notifications@github.com]\n_Sent:_ Monday, December 14, 2015 11:13 AM\n_To:_ apache/incubator-trafodion incubator-trafodion@noreply.github.com\n_Cc:_ Roberta Marton roberta.marton@esgyn.com\n_Subject:_ Re: [incubator-trafodion] TRAFODION-1704: T2 and T4 driver\ncleanup (#224)\n\nThank you, Roberta.

With\nthis delivery  all existing tests have been run and passed. This check-in,\nhowever, disables several jdbc methods mostly related to T4 row sets. We do\nnot have regression tests for these jdbc methods. Therefore, if someone\nwrites a test to use one of the disabled methods a “not supported” error is\nreturned.  The tests that fail use scroll sensitive and scroll insensitive\nrequests.\n\nI was hoping that this delivery would become the next release candidate and\nit would be submitted to Apache.  However,  a decision needs to be made if\nwe should release this with missing functionality.  We are working on\nadding these missing methods.\n\nSince this is the first Apache release, no one has built using the source\ntar file so there should not be any regressions.  Also people can still go\nto the git repository and build from the release 2.0 branch that has this\nfunctionality.  When release 1.3 is merged into 2.0, we will make sure all\nthe methods work as desired.\n\nOpinion:\n\n+1 – go ahead and release with unsupported methods\n\n0 – no opinion\n\n-1 – add code for unsupported methods\n\n```\nRoberta\n```\n\n_From:_ DaveBirdsall [mailto:notifications@github.com\nnotifications@github.com]\n_Sent:_ Monday, December 14, 2015 11:13 AM\n_To:_ apache/incubator-trafodion incubator-trafodion@noreply.github.com\n_Cc:_ Roberta Marton roberta.marton@esgyn.com\n_Subject:_ Re: [incubator-trafodion] TRAFODION-1704: T2 and T4 driver\ncleanup (#224)\n\nThank you, Roberta.
