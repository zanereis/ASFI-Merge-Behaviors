It can as well be removed, and that wouldn't change anything about the object of the PR (the functionality that it proposes to add), nor about the completeness of the testing of that functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you want, I can remove it.\r\n\r\n2) this test attempts to parse some JSON-LD whose @context contains the URI of schema.org - probably the most obvious use-case for reading JSON-LD\r\n\r\n    - BTW, I didn't see any test about reading JSON-LD. Are there any?\r\n\r\n     - If this test cannot connect to schema.org because there are no external connection, (or for whatever reason) the test won't fail, because the RiotException is catched. Just one line is written to the console (and it is not by the test itself, but by the code that it calls). So this test with this external connection doesn't really cause trouble to the integration process (maybe a few seconds delay - the time for the HTTP client to stop trying to connect)\r\n\r\n     - it shows me that I'm not able to read such JSON-LD on my machine (I get on the console: ```org.apache.jena.riot.RiotException: loading remote context failed: http://schema.org/```) - this, in a setting where it should work (standard jena 3.1.1, run from eclipse where I can connect to external resources from java, for instance using jersey client)\r\n\r\nSo: as far as I can tell (thanks to this test), current jena has a problem reading JSON-LD with @context set to a URI (at least, I have such a problem using current jena). As suggested by @ajs6f, I opened a jira issue about it.\r\n\r\n- it is probably possible to write a test that simulates connecting to an external resource without connecting to it (cf. \"cache\" mechanism in JSON-LD java), but\r\n\t- such a test would probably not detect a problem such as the one we seem to have here\r\n\t- it's out of the scope of current PR ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/272043239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/272121464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/203#issuecomment-272121464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/203","id":272121464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjEyMTQ2NA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-12T09:56:55Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T09:56:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> BTW, I didn't see any test about reading JSON-LD.

Currently the top K results will (or at least should) be from near the center of the area, but with the sorting disabled, the selection of the top K results will become random.\r\n\r\nI have to wonder why the sorting is so slow though. I don't know much about spatial data processing, but I suppose that calculating the distances of ~2500 coordinates to a given center point, and then sorting the list of 2500 results by those distances, shouldn't take 20 seconds.

It is a tradeoff - space vs time - for the default setup.  If you want pure speed, use a `ParserProfile` with a different `RDFFactory` - `RDFFactorStd` is the non-caching one, `RDFFactorCaching` is the caching one.\r\n\r\nWhat would be useful to make any progress is to understand what you are trying to do. Raw parser performance is not necessarily the right metric because data is used for a purpose.  The figures you have don't match what I measured, and remeasured for this issue, and without seeing the test and data, it is not possible to draw any insight.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to explore improvements, it would be useful to use a Java profiler on the code. `RDFFactorCaching is the place to look. It use a cache from Google Guava so maybe there is a better choice there are no concurrency issues.\r\n\r\nIt is the fact that a simple thing that like a cache can make a performance difference, that suggests to me that the basic parser (characters to RDF terms) is close to maximum performance (it's the I/O and bytes to UTF-8 that is the limitation). Any addition work to handle the output is going to slow the overall performance. This is confirmed by the fact the Turtle parser on the same N-Triples data, is slower than the N-triples parse yet the only difference is code paths with `if` statements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/279149691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/279414434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/50#issuecomment-279414434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/50","id":279414434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTQxNDQzNA==","user":{"login":"stain","id":253413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzQxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/253413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain","html_url":"https://github.com/stain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-13T14:56:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T14:57:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have updated https://hub.docker.com/r/stain/jena/ and https://hub.docker.com/r/stain/jena-fuseki/ to the latest releases (3.2.0, 2.5.0).\r\n\r\nIt's now based on `java:8-jre-alpine` base image so it should automatically updated with a newer java arrives.\r\n\r\nI am a bit hampered trying to contribute to this as I am not a Jena committer and don't want to step on toes; after all, releasing Jena is the job of the PMC.\r\n\r\nI think this pull request is moot, it is very difficult to test it with the Docker build as part of the source build, as basically you will require a new compilation of the whole thing inside `Dockerfile`, or you would have to use a Maven plugin to build the Docker image (which would then require Docker installed). \r\n\r\nJena already have a massive git repository which can take considerable time & disk to build, and I don't think it's right to add more to it.\r\n\r\nI think Jena and Fuseki should become two official images under the `_` namespace in Docker Hub - and then there should be a mini-git repository \"jena-docker\" - similar to [my jena-docker](https://github.com/stain/jena-docker) - but hosted under `apache/`, which could then be referenced from https://github.com/docker-library/official-images. \r\n\r\n(You may notice that some products like tomcat and solr have their distro-repositories straight on github)\r\n\r\nThat image will then simply pull the latest release from `dist.apache.org` and one only need to update version number and sha1 on any new release.

You will see there that the tests follow the same form as in other Jena modules (explicitly linked together in suites and run by `maven-surefire`). I would myself have preferred to use more usual practices such as those to which I suppose you to be referring (tests selected by name, `maven-failsafe` for integration tests) but at least this way is consistent across the Jena code base.\r\n\r\nSo in order to put your tests into that module as it stands you would have to use the Maven plugin to start an ES node before the `test` phase and stop it afterwards. There aren't any such phases that seem particularly suitable to me, but you could use `process-test-classes` and `prepare-package`, I suppose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it might be better (I think it would be better) to put your tests into that module and execute them with `maven-failsafe`. Then you can use the `pre-` and `post-integration-test` phases to start and stop the ES node, which is (to my understanding) the right and normal timing for that kind of operation.\r\n\r\nA last alternative would be to break that integration test module down into submodules, one for each module being tested.
