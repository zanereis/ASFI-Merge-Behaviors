I didn't look at any of the code under test or the test itself - I have suspicions that configuration changes might break it and/or make it too slow.

(now I won't rebase again, I will add new commits on the PR).\nI have the following questions:\n- from my understanding watermark is when the data is actually processed in the pipeline, compare to the timestamp which is when the data has been actually created. It allows us to deal with the skew (the gap between data creation time and data processing time). Correct ? So, in the JMS case, the timestamp is basically the message timestamp and the watermark is when the message is consumed from the broker.\n- the checkpoint is an object holding the last data consumed. It's a kind of unique identifier for the message. In the case of JMS, I'm using the Message ID which is unique and generated by the broker. Correct ?\n- I implemented the initial split reader using the executor recommendation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228379743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228392842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/528#issuecomment-228392842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/528","id":228392842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODM5Mjg0Mg==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T16:27:12Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T16:27:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To separate the syntax, we need the dependency to be the other direction.
