I'm not sure Parameter Value Provider would work for us since these have to be passed in on runtime or in the properties file. We're going to be supporting a variety of flows stored in Registry.

So those flows that utilize sensitive parameter contexts need to be able to work under any running statless nifi pod/container. We wouldn't be changing the run command or properties files for each flow that's processed with stateless NiFi. Instead, they would have to be pulled from some secrets manager or k8s secrets.

for your hard work on this @markap14 . I mainly looked at the code and left comments there but there are some questions/observations left on my mind, mostly about dependency management\r\n- Why are we installing the dependencies for each Python extension on NiFi startup? This massively slows down NiFi startup.  I believe installing them when creating the first processor of an extension would improve the user experience because there's a high chance the user will never use these extensions, yet they pay the price for them existing.\r\n- Related to the previous and one of my comments left: There's currently no UI indication of dependency installation, whether it failed or not and virtual env creation. Currently adding a Python processor takes around 10-20 on my machine and it feels like that the UI is unresponsive during that time.\r\n- I'm wondering why the dependency installation and virtual environment creation is ordered like this? It's kinda backwards of how most virtual environments are created for Python. The environment should be created first, then dependencies are installed afterward. Currently we are installing the dependencies, then creating the environment.\r\n- Related to the previous question: I don't really get how dependencies are \"seen\" by each interpreter. Dependencies should  go to `$ENVDIR/lib/$PYTHONVERSION/site-packages`, yet dependencies are installed to `$ENVDIR`. I have tested this approach on my machine with my virtual environments and couldn't import the modules under `$ENVDIR` unless I've set `PYTHONPATH`. I do not see `PYTHONPATH` being set to `$ENVDIR`. Can you shed some lights on how this works?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1471969300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1471978083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7035#issuecomment-1471978083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7035","id":1471978083,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5XvJpj","user":{"login":"johnAlJunior","id":127732633,"node_id":"U_kgDOB50LmQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127732633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior","html_url":"https://github.com/johnAlJunior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-16T13:42:44Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T13:42:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done it.\r\nCan you review?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1471978083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1472010156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7035#issuecomment-1472010156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7035","id":1472010156,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5XvRes","user":{"login":"johnAlJunior","id":127732633,"node_id":"U_kgDOB50LmQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127732633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior","html_url":"https://github.com/johnAlJunior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnAlJunior/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-16T13:52:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T13:52:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

for the testing @emiliosetiadarma!\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion with @mcgilman, I pushed an update to change the source of initial application Bearer Token expiration.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation derived the application Bearer Token expiration from the ID Token, but the update changes the approach to derive the expiration from the Access Token. This strategy aligns both initial expiration and refreshed expiration to derive from the Access Token expiration.\r\n\r\nSome Identity Providers return the same expiration value for both the ID Token and the Access Token, so the end result will not change for those providers. Changing the source of the application Bearer Token expiration to the Access Token expiration provides a consistent approach, and the updated section of the Administrator's Guide reflects these changes. Some Identity Providers make the Access Token expiration configurable, so this also aligns with expected integration behavior.\r\n\r\nI also rebased the pull request from the current main

I agree that moving this capability into NiFi application code itself would be the most robust. Some searches showed that it might be be possible to use SpringBoot's `ConfigurationProperties` library without using SpringBoot, but that would probably be too big a lift. It's an option, but maybe we could implement our own solution.
