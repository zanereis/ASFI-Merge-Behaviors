I understand your purpose is to make it more *convenient* to use, but IMO, it might confuse user as he need to know the `convention` before using it. How about something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninputTableA.apply(BeamSql.simpleQuery(\"TABLE_A\", sql1));\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet user specify the `TABLE_A` explicitly.

thinking is that from a user's perspective:\r\n\r\n1. Convenient, but unintuitive, especially to an outsider trying to understand what the statement means. SQL syntax is typically very precise. I can't think of any other examples where an identifier is used as simply a placeholder, regardless of what the actual identifier is. When I first read the simpleQuery examples, I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out what the TABLE_A name was associated with. The fact that it isn't explicitly associated with anything is unexpected.\r\n2. Allows the SQL syntax to be checked against a specific identifier, which is nice, but requires that identifier to be redundantly specified in the same method call. In that sense, it's almost equivalent to option 1 (though it does at least give an answer to where the identifier comes from), but with the arbitrary name specified twice.\r\n3. Allows the SQL syntax to be checked against a specific identifier, and in the case of PCOLLECTION (and/or PCOL?), that identifier also helps document what is happening: you're very explicitly querying the PCollection in that case. For that reason, I'm somewhat less fond of TABLE, since it doesn't have the same self-describing quality.\r\n\r\nSo from that perspective, #3 with PCOLLECTION (and maybe optionally PCOL as a shorthand) is my preferred choice. \r\n\r\nOther perspectives?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/309189722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/309190080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3372#issuecomment-309190080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3372","id":309190080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTE5MDA4MA==","user":{"login":"xumingming","id":379733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming","html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T03:26:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T03:33:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I want to analyze this problem from another perspective: the `simpleQuery` is not so simple that you just need to write a `sql`, you can't execute query on an arbitrary PCollection, before you invoke `simpleQuery`, you need to do some preparation to convert a normal `PCollection` to a `PCollection<BeamSqlRow>` -- to convert unstructured data to structured rows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nTableSchema tableBSchema = ...;\r\nPCollection<BeamSqlRow> inputTableB = p.apply(TextIO.read().from(\"/my/input/pathb\"))\r\n    .apply(BeamSql.fromTextRow(tableBSchema));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith all these preparation code already there, I don't think adding an explicit tableName declaration will make it verbose.  It just does the `registration` and `query` in the same method.\r\n\r\nSo if vote, I will vote for #2.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAnd this also reminds me another option: can we declare the tableName when do the conversion(convert normal data into BeamSqlRow), something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nTableSchema tableBSchema = ...;\r\nPCollection<BeamSqlRow> inputTableB = p.apply(TextIO.read().from(\"/my/input/pathb\"))\r\n    .apply(BeamSql.fromTextRow(tableName, tableBSchema));\r\n```\r\n\r\nit tells user that:\r\n\r\n> we are turning your data into a table with the given tableName and these resulting rows.\r\n\r\nAnd then you can query without specifying any tableName, but the signature of the query methods might need to change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/309190080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/309190799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3372#issuecomment-309190799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3372","id":309190799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTE5MDc5OQ==","user":{"login":"takidau","id":14131530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMxNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14131530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau","html_url":"https://github.com/takidau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takidau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-17T03:43:14Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T03:43:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If the registration can happen as part of BeamSql.fromTextRow, and be valid for any future invocation of simpleQuery, that sounds like it might be a good option.

An arbitrary table name would be confused to users, especially the same PCollection can have different table names, and different PCollection can have the same table name;\r\n2. explicit table name is more clear, as how we do in `BeamSql.query()`;\r\n3. Since each query has its own Schema namespace, the table name in `BeamSql.simpleQuery()` is useless, required only by SQL grammar.
