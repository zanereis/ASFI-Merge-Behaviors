My bad.\r\n\r\nWhat I got stuck on was the handling for date formatting. Looks like java.time is stricter on date format strings: \"dd MMM yyyy\" that we use means the date has to have two digits i.e. leading zero for 1-9, whereas Joda accepted a single digit as well. The PR fixes this by changing every date in the tests to be 01 etc. But my concern was about the real clients out there calling the APIs: will this not break the API for all of them, as they have been sending dates without leading zeros? \r\n\r\nThe right solution of course would be to use the right date format \"d M y\" which accepts both leading zero and without. But the date format is a string that is sent by the client in some cases. And we have no control over what format strings they send...\r\n\r\nSo I wasn't able to find a solution that we could use that would avoid breaking API clients. Any ideas would be very welcome...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/699536224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/699668368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1179#issuecomment-699668368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1179","id":699668368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5OTY2ODM2OA==","user":{"login":"percyashu","id":40401381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDAxMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40401381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu","html_url":"https://github.com/percyashu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/percyashu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-27T18:10:27Z","updated_at":"2020-09-27T18:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptuomola Yeah java.time is stricter on date format, I noticed this during the migration. \r\n\r\n> The PR fixes this by changing every date in the tests to be 01 etc \r\n\r\nActually the PR doesn't fixes this in that way.
