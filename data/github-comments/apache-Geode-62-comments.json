However, returning a `ObjectOpenCustomHashSet` from the lambdas in `RedisSetCommandsFunctionExecutor.internalsmembers()` or `RedisSetCommandsFunctionExecutor.smembers()` results in serialization filter errors, so as a compromise, this set copying behaviour is used to allow a `HashSet` to be returned from the lambda and then turned back into a `ObjectOpenCustomHashSet` when needed for diff and intersection.

@DonalEvans and all,\r\n\r\nThanks for the review!\r\n\r\nRegarding your question whether it is possible to check on receiving member if is notification only. I have already tried that with previous commit https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6477/commits/b3dbf5024dd378ef1bbb48658cf02500b6cff6c9  which broke design base case explained in this comment: https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6477#issuecomment-846037604\r\n\r\nBeside above solution I was considering another alternative solution on receiving member. When TXCommitMessage is received on member which doesn't host targeted bucket (only subscription queue) then part of code within following if statement is executed :\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/geode/blob/be1fad39c4f7291ad37051ba1e59046f8c52537e/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/TXCommitMessage.java#L1300\r\n\r\nImpact (set TailKey to -1) could be done within to avoid putting the event in parallel gateway sender temporary queue. I haven't done it because I was unsure of the case that is described in following comment (open link since it has multiple lines):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/geode/blob/be1fad39c4f7291ad37051ba1e59046f8c52537e/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/TXCommitMessage.java#L1323\r\n\r\nIn comment it is stated that this part of code can be also reached while data bucket (colocated parallel gateway-sender queue bucket is always created after data bucket) is being created and `TXCommitMessage` message is received. I couldn't been able to get this case, and I'm not sure that it is possible. I tried to execute transactions before member requests for data bucket `InitialImageOperation$RequestRVVMessage` (this is done even before GII) and in this case `if (this.internalRegion instanceof PartitionedRegion)` condition is not fulfilled because targeted BucketRegion is at this point of time already created and therefore `internalRegion` variable is of type `BucketRegion` and not `PartitionedRegion`.\r\n\r\nBased on all above, at least to me, it seems that impact could be created on receiving member. Also I guess that even if it happens that some parallel gateway-sender events are ignored in period before` InitialImageOperation$RequestRVVMessage` (for data bucket region) everything should be fine, because these gateway-sender events should be transferred later on in initial image for colocated gateway-sender queue bucket.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I'm not experienced in this part and I'm probably missing something. What do you think? Is this better solution? Any other suggestion is welcome.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/848723153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/848982659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6510#issuecomment-848982659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6510","id":848982659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0ODk4MjY1OQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-26T17:38:50Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T17:38:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> please also change `_` to `-` in the three benchmarks jobs names for consistency, and update .asf.yaml as well (even though the copy on develop is not yet the source of truth, it will eventually overwrite what's on master when 1.15.0 is released)\r\n\r\nDone.

If community is not interested in such change, I will close this PR.\r\n\r\nIts not community is interested or not; it is the nature of the problem that could raise many questions/concerns and its effectiveness that could bring different views and could take time to resolve (for good). If you can see many community members are involved here trying to get to an optimal conclusion.\r\nLooking at the problem and the solution proposed; this problem seems to be a good candidate to raise an RFC, where discussion could have been carried out to understand the pros and cons of the issue and solutions.\r\nFrom the problem description it seems you are trying to address performance issue with client connection. It would have been nice to see, what kind of performance impact we are looking at (e.g. with prototype)\r\nBecause of the sensitive nature of the issue (use/exposure of a n/w info) it will be nice to talked about any security issues that this could bring about.\r\nAs I mentioned above; some of the areas that could have been discussed in RFC are:\r\n- Benefits (with some sample perf number)\r\n- Security concerns/issues with this\r\n- Case where an external client tries to fetch the internal info (outside of k8 env - what happens in this case) \r\n- How other client connection could be impacted or can use similar in future (Java, C++, JMX, Gfsh, pulse connections)\r\n- Requirement for Backward compatibility,  rolling upgrade tests (I am not seeing any here)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/850589885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/850600060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6539#issuecomment-850600060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6539","id":850600060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDYwMDA2MA==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-28T18:42:12Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T18:42:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"good

Certainly on the current develop branch, any older version of Geode will cause problems if a Lucene query is attempted, but once 1.15.0 has been released, there should be no problem with rolling from 1.15.0 to a newer version, providing the Lucene version hasn't changed again. It might be better to instead check that there is no member older than the version in which Lucene was updated (1.15.0, assuming we don't cut the release branch before these changes are merged).
