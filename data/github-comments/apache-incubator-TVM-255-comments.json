@vinceab, thanks for posting! here's what I think:\r\n- it would indeed be great to place this somewhere central so that other users could benefit from this\r\n- it's not clear to me it makes sense that this place should be inside the TVM repo--this is mostly configuration rather than TVM code itself\r\n- something else like a central wiki where people could post up e.g. this configuration or pointers to repos which use TVM may be helpful\r\n- the problem with doing this is API drift. we can't really solve that now given tvm's slow release schedule when people are using python scripts to drive tvm. however, there are a couple of ways this could get addressed in the future:\r\n     1. your use case is pretty standard (build shared library, upload for remote exection). it's likely as part of `tvmc` work we should introduce an e.g. yaml format for this data\r\n     2. as tvm releases become more frequent, repos can state the version of TVM they depend on in e.g. `requirements.txt`, and could be linked from a central place.\r\n\r\ncc @jwfromm @tqchen
