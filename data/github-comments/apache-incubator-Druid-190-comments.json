This has a risk of deadlock if not handled correctly, where all threads are taken up by merge needs without the ability for worker sub-tasks to do their thing.\r\n\r\nThis seems like the best way to approach it, but we have to be careful to chunk up the work into small enough chunks so a big merge doesn't starve out the processing pool.\r\n\r\nAlso the flame graph is pretty rad 😎","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/397746921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/397759770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5885#issuecomment-397759770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5885","id":397759770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzc1OTc3MA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T22:39:51Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T22:39:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Caching is not enabled on brokers in this case","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/397759770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/397760873","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5884#issuecomment-397760873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5884","id":397760873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzc2MDg3Mw==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T22:46:46Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T22:46:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@varaga That sounds reasonable, can you please submit a PR?

It is not the cpu time I'm saying doesn't match it, it is the node time from the view of the broker vs the query time from the point of view of the historicals.\r\n\r\nIs it possible this is due to another one of these possible reasons?\r\n\r\n- The `druid.server.http.numThreads` limit has been reached on the historicals. In this case, `query/time` would be smaller than `query/node/time`, since `query/time` measures from when an http thread picks up the query. But a query could spend substantial time waiting for an http thread to pick it up.\r\n- The `druid.broker.http.numConnections` limit has been reached on the broker. Same deal, but the concurrency limit is client-side rather than server-side.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/398176360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/398242385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5801#issuecomment-398242385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5801","id":398242385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODI0MjM4NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-19T01:08:40Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T01:08:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@surekhasaharan from the test, might this be a real error?\r\n\r\n```\r\nTests run: 19, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.268 sec <<< FAILURE!

Formally define that topN and groupBy behave differently. But this is unappealing, since I think you'd want topN and groupBys that \"look equivalent\" to behave similarly.\r\n2. Modify topN to behave like groupBy. However, this is unappealing too, since I like how topN works now.\r\n3. Modify groupBy to behave like topN when grouping on one dimension. Extend this to grouping on more than one dimensions by making groupBy \"implode\" rows when _any_ multi-value dimension in the grouping set is empty. So if any of them is empty, the result row disappears. This is pretty consistent with how grouping would behave if you think of the multi-value dimensions as like an inner join on some kind of virtual table. It may be surprising to users, though, that their rows go \"missing\".\r\n4. Modify groupBy to behave like topN when grouping on one dimension. Extend this to grouping on more than one dimensions by making groupBy treat empty multi-value dimensions as nulls in this case. This has an advantage over (3) in that rows never go \"missing\", but it's a little less internally consistent. It would mean groupBy behaves differently in the 1-dimension case and the more-than-one-dimension case.\r\n\r\nNone of these is perfect. I think 3 or 4 sounds best? Probably 4? Number 3 strikes me as the more 'pure' approach but I could see it being pretty unintuitive for people. And potentially not as useful as number 4.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/399510197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/399550390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5897#issuecomment-399550390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5897","id":399550390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTU1MDM5MA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-22T19:08:34Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T22:54:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would vote for 3. We should avoid such an exception like in 4 as possible as we can. Also, 3 can be easily expressed by SQL like below. `explode()` is an UTDF similar to Hive's `explode` function.
