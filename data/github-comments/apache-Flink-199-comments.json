I much prefer free form over checkboxes.\r\n\r\n@fhueske I'm questioning my understanding of the the heuristic for using a hash-combine. For a fixed number of keys the hash-combine can be beneficial independent of the size of the data set. Basing the decision on the ratio of keys to values, as the size of the data set increases the likelihood of matching keys and values occurring in the same combine operation (before filling and being flushed to the reducer) decreases.\r\n\r\nThis is often the case for graphs. I'm thinking that the improvement for using hash-combine on larger data sets may have been due to hashing performing better than sort when we wanted to disable the combiner.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/317034403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/317034975","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4379#issuecomment-317034975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4379","id":317034975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzAzNDk3NQ==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T15:39:56Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T15:39:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Loos good to me. +1 to merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/317034975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/317038941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4372#issuecomment-317038941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4372","id":317038941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzAzODk0MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T15:54:17Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T15:54:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think you are right @greghogan. \r\n\r\nIt's not about the ratio of #distinct keys to size of the dataset.

I've done most of the work, but after I deprecated `tableEnv.sql` method and modify all the relevant test cases, \r\nI found a problem when validate input `sql String` in the `sqlSelect` method , we need to enumerate all kinds of `SqlNode` except `SqlDelete / SqlInsert` and `dml Sql Operations`, because it's not a `SqlSelect` for such a query `select * from A union select * from B`.\r\nDid we provide too many types of sql method ?\r\nAnd I had a look at the `Jdbc` api, it provided the following sql execution methods( see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html)\r\n- `Boolean execute ()` Executes the SQL statement in this PreparedStatement object, which may be any kind of SQL statement.\r\n- `ResultSet executeQuery ()` Executes the SQL query in this PreparedStatement object and returns the ResultSet object generated by the query.\r\n- `int executeUpdate ()` Executes the SQL statement in this PreparedStatement object, which must be an SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement, such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE; or an SQL statement that returns nothing, such as a DDL statement.\r\n\r\nSince `Jdbc` is well known to most Java developers, I think it's a good reference to our api design. \r\nI propose to provide the corresponding  three methods:\r\n- `sql(sql: String): Option[Table]` In this PR keeps current `sql(sql: String): Table` method deprecated, and will open another jira to implement the new sql method to support any kinds of sql String(even a mixed string contains several types of sql statements) which will return the value of Option[Table] or other value (discuss later).\r\n- `sqlQuery(sql: String): Table` \r\n- `sqlUpdate(sql: String): Option[Long]` considering returns the affected row count in the future which is more meaningful than 'Unit' \r\n \r\nchanging the existing test case from the use of `sql` method to the `sqlQuery` method, update the document and will explain the relationship with Jdbc methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nBest,

@lincoln-lil, I think it is a very good idea to strive for consistency with JDBC. Here is what I think about the proposed methods:\r\n\r\n- `sqlQuery(sql: String): Table`: Looks good to me\r\n- `sqlUpdate(sql: String): Option[Long]`: This method requires an optional `QueryConfig` object (either as optional argument or in a second method). We also need a Java version that does not use `Option` (maybe encode `None` as `-1L`). We should also think about whether we want the Scala and Java APIs to be consistent.\r\n- `sql(sql: String): Option[Table]`: I'm not sure about this method. I think it would rather confuses than helps. IMO, there is a clear separation between `sqlQuery` and `sqlUpdate` that users have to be aware of. This is even true, if they would use `sql()` because they would need to handle the returned `Option`. Moreover, we would need to change the signature of a method which is a more significant change than deprecating the method.\r\n\r\nI think the decision about this API change should not be done in this PR but discussed on the dev@f.a.o mailing list. Would you like to start a [DISCUSS] thread and propose your ideas there?\r\n\r\nRegarding the issue of distinguishing `SELECT` queries from `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries, we can change `FlinkPlannerImpl.parse()` to call `SqlParser.parseQuery()` instead of `SqlParser.parseStmt()`. `parseQuery()` accepts `SELECT` queries + `UNION`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`.\r\n\r\nThanks, Fabian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/317694437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/317696778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4296#issuecomment-317696778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4296","id":317696778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzY5Njc3OA==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-25T10:28:08Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T10:28:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've
