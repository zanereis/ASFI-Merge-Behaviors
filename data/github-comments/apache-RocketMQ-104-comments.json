非常感谢你的review.\r\n\r\n首先`DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl`中的`serviceState`是可以通过`DefaultLitePullConsumer`被并发访问的，即使`DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl`是”非共享“的。\r\n\r\n其次`#isCreateJust()`和`#getServiceState()`加锁最简单、重要的原因是：在`DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl`中对`serviceState`的访问、包括读写**之前都是加对象锁的，我推测可能是因为`#start()`和`#shutdown()`中包含 check-then-action 操作，最初的设计者想要避免程序读取到 action 之前的无效状态**。\r\n\r\n综上，我认为`DefaultLitePullConsumerImpl`对`serviceState`在并发环境下的安全访问作出了承诺：开发者(包括源码维护者)可以安全的访问`serviceState`而无需自己做额外的同步策略去防止读取到无效状态。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1108842641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1108845518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4094#issuecomment-1108845518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4094","id":1108845518,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85CF6PO","user":{"login":"dugenkui03","id":18216266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18216266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03","html_url":"https://github.com/dugenkui03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dugenkui03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-25T17:27:30Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T03:09:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RongtongJin
