If application wants to specify priority across side inputs, it wouldn't be respected.  \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/8621db68b64f3d4f2c1a2aa986e3b1ea0dd80969/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/clustermanager/ClusterBasedJobCoordinator.java#L321\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/8621db68b64f3d4f2c1a2aa986e3b1ea0dd80969/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/zk/ZkJobCoordinator.java#L369\r\n[3] https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/8621db68b64f3d4f2c1a2aa986e3b1ea0dd80969/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/config/DefaultChooserConfig.java#L54\r\n[4]https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/8621db68b64f3d4f2c1a2aa986e3b1ea0dd80969/samza-core/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/config/DefaultChooserConfig.java#L73","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/500056117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/500077026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1075#issuecomment-500077026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1075","id":500077026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDA3NzAyNg==","user":{"login":"ghostli123","id":2987681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODc2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2987681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123","html_url":"https://github.com/ghostli123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostli123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-08T00:29:13Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T00:29:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@vjagadish1989 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/500077026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/500607399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1066#issuecomment-500607399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1066","id":500607399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDYwNzM5OQ==","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-10T21:46:51Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T21:46:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bharathkk \r\nre: 1, good point about partition count monitor, let me see if / how we can fix that.\r\nre: 2, I thought we moved side inputs out of the run loop to the CSM.

Batching large number of writes will be an issue with any implementation, so perhaps this should be addressed at the API layer, either by supporting batch puts, or by accepting the JobModel (and other large messages like configs) as a whole and chunking internally within an implementation. Also, when we have versioning in metadata store, we should also not need to store the job model in ZK.\r\n\r\n@shanthoosh I don't like that we'e diverging in both the code path and key name for job models in ZK and YARN.

Segmenting the `JobModel` and storing it as independent byte array chunks will be necessary for any `MetadataStore` that doesn't support unlimited value size. This utility is not specific to `ZkMetadataStore` implementation alone and hence would be better to keep it outside of it.\r\n\r\n2. Storing the checksum during writes and verifying it during the reads would prevent us from data corruption. I think it is a good suggestion, if acceptable, will be added in a immediate follow-up.\r\n\r\nJust for context, summarizing the points I had discussed offline with you for using zookeeper to store `JobModel`. \r\n\r\nA. *Performance:* \r\n\r\n   * Number of `MetadataStore` writes: Current job model storage mechanism used for YARN is write intensive. JobModel is composed of different kind of metadata viz `TaskPartitionAssignment`, `TaskChangeLogAssignment`, `TaskContainerAssignment`, `Locality` etc and they are stored at task granularity independently. For a samza job that consumes from N input topic partitions, employing `YARN` metadata-storage-managers would result in 4 * N writes to the `MetadataStore` layer(For both `CoordinatorStreamStore`/`ZkMetadataStore`). Even after tuning kafka batch size, this is expensive for large standalone jobs(Example: Search standalone jobs consumes from 15K topic partitions on average).\r\n\r\n   * JobModel write frequency: Currently in YARN, the JobModel is computed and stored in `MetadataStore` only once in `ApplicationMaster` startup. In standalone, JobModel can be computed and published multiple times as a part of a single deployment. \r\n\r\n   * Performance tests: I compared the time taken to publish JobModel with existing YARN approach vs segmenting JobModel by size through a series of perf-tests. From my performance tests, YARN approach to store JobModel is significantly slower(10-20 times slower with coordinator-stream implementation) when compared to segmenting the JobModel by size. Example: For a JobModel of size 5MB containing 10K input topic partitions, size based JobModel splitting approach would just perform 5 metadata-store-writes when compared to 40K metadata-store-writes by current YARN approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. *Versioning:* JobModel versioning is not supported in coordinator stream currently. Let's say leader dies after publishing some portion of JobModel. From the coordinator stream alone, we cannot correctly compute the correct JobModel in standalone currently. This is required for jobmodel-lineage tracking and versioned JobModel read for functional correctness.\r\n\r\nC. *Observability:* Currently YARN has dashboard support for viewing the JobModel. If we use coordinator stream to store JobModel in standalone then there's no tooling around JobModel visibility. This will make trouble shooting a standalone job harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/501934727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/502163083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1079#issuecomment-502163083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1079","id":502163083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjE2MzA4Mw==","user":{"login":"dnishimura","id":512169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjE2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura","html_url":"https://github.com/dnishimura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnishimura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-14T15:54:03Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T15:54:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice summary @shanthoosh.

(i.e. flush after M entries). Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the performance hit mainly because of the current way of \"flush per entry\"?

Let's say we update the `JobModel` at single location(and call it latest). Please consider the following execution sequence.\r\n\r\n1.

Shall a `commandhandler` have its own environment variables? Shall their environment variables start with `shell.`? At the moment we treat all environment variables starting with `shell.` as the Shell's, and pass everything else to the executor. The logic may no longer work. We may need to distinguish them, like `shell.` , `executor.`, `commandhandler1.`, `commandhandler2.`, etc.\r\n\r\nThe SET command and multiple `commandhandler`s. Just like we allow user to change the `executor` via the `SET` command, we allow user to change `commandhandler`s via the `SET` command. However, with multiple `commandhandler`s allowed, it's a bit tricky. Say a user has loaded `commandhandler1` and `commandhandler2`. He or she now wants to use `commandhandler3` as well. We wouldn't want them to issue a command like:\r\n`SET commandhandler = commandhandler1, commandhandler2, commandhandler3`\r\nWhat's in my mind is new commands `load` and `unload`. User may issue commands like:\r\n```\r\nload commandhandler1\r\nload commandhandler2\r\n```\r\nWe may also want to consider distinguish commands of different commandhandlers by adding a prefix on the command, like:\r\n```\r\ncommandhandler1.commandA\r\ncommandhandler2.commandA\r\n```\r\nLet me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/513416791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/513418263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1106#issuecomment-513418263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1106","id":513418263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzQxODI2Mw==","user":{"login":"shenodaguirguis","id":45050883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDUwODgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45050883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis","html_url":"https://github.com/shenodaguirguis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenodaguirguis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-20T00:27:40Z","updated_at":"2019-07-20T00:27:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"my 2-mites:\r\n+ the load/unload commands makes perfect sense, can be a future work\r\n+ I am not a big fan of prefixing commands with handlers, not very user friendly? ... besides, with load/unload this won't be needed, but I don't anticipate users shuffling command handlers much, this feature is mainly to allow each user to plug-in their favorite handler.\r\n+ We can discuss offline the env vars scope, I don't see them applicable per handler...

Does `Put` have to be synchronous? Since `flush()` is exposed as part of API, what do you think about callers handling it in two steps? Have we evaluated this?\r\n> 2. What is the use of `flush()`? Looking at the implementation of `Put` and `PutAll`, both are synchronous. Do we intend to have different behavior for future MetadataStore implementation? If so, I suppose we should follow up this PR with another PR that details the guarantees and expectations of these APIs.\r\n\r\nI believe the original intent of the metadata store is to have consistent behavior regardless of the underlying store. Since it's simpler to make async calls synchronous than vice-versa, the expected behavior is synchronous. The intent of the `putAll` API is to provide an optimization option at least for the short-term until the next-gen metadata store abstraction is designed. That being said, I think flush() should not be exposed as an external API.\r\nAll good points you have brought up that we can take into account for the next phase of the metadata store design.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/514729680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/514789596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1114#issuecomment-514789596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1114","id":514789596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDc4OTU5Ng==","user":{"login":"weiqingy","id":8546874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDY4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8546874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy","html_url":"https://github.com/weiqingy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiqingy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T20:34:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T20:35:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you please also add the Java document on interfaces and public methods added in https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1106?
