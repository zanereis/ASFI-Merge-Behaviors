In the integration test that I modified to upload realtime segments, I considered the refresh use case and modified the CRC of the existing segment on ZK for it, but in servers, the CRC remains the same on the local file and the segment refresh path doesn't get to the point to actually download the segment - it uses the existing segment since the CRC of the uploaded segment and the one residing on server are the same. I'll make the changes and try to update the integration test to change the CRC of the local file on server side.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1111382267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1111401037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8595#issuecomment-1111401037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8595","id":1111401037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5CPqJN","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-27T19:31:54Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T19:31:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you please try removing the escape character?
