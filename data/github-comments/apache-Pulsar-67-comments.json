I pushed a commit to your PR with my proposed fix\r\n\r\nI have removed the code in the JSONSchema that was causing the problem.  The original reason we added that code was so that fields from child classes don't get serialized if the schema is set to the base class.  However, after some thinking, I don't think this is necessary and likely impossible to accomplish given the problem @chrismiller described.  I think its ok to still serialize the field of child classes and write them to a topic given that you can read them out on the consumer end as the base class which currently you can.  So I don't see a point to going down the rabbit hole of how not to serialize child class fields.  We might even want this behavior given that users can evolve their schema over time.\r\n\r\n@sijie @srkukarni @merlimat @ivankelly what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/438036483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/438037321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2974#issuecomment-438037321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2974","id":438037321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODAzNzMyMQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T21:38:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T21:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng We should also remove the zip file from sources before 2.3 release.

So, in that case it's hard to handle multiple requests from subscribers so, it's better to let subscriber handle those admin-api.\r\n\r\n#899 restricts subscription-name creation with the role-name prefix but it will not address authorization of existing subscription name which doesn't have role-name prefix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/438460762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/438462255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2981#issuecomment-438462255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2981","id":438462255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODQ2MjI1NQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T22:26:40Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T22:26:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> #899 restricts subscription-name creation with the role-name prefix but it will not address authorization of existing subscription name which doesn't have role-name prefix.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is to end up with 2 ways to do (almost) the same thing, which might be confusing to users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/438462255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/438462601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2981#issuecomment-438462601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2981","id":438462601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODQ2MjYwMQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-13T22:27:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T22:27:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Isn't it possible to give permissions to these subscriptions individually (with the existing solution and without changing subscription names) ?
