Ambari itself is a Java and Python program, theoretically supporting all operating systems. However, Ambari includes two acceleration libraries (.c) in the Ambari agent, which leads to coupling with the operating system.\r\n\r\n2. The big data components managed by Ambari have different levels of coupling with the operating system, depending on their implementation. So if you want Ambari to support Rocky 9, you can refer to this PR for Rocky 8:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3758/files\r\n\r\n3. Because of this PR, I modified the Jenkinsfile, which will temporarily cause the project's CI/CD to fail, but this will be fixed quickly. So if you submit a PR, don't worry about the CI/CD issues caused by this PR.\r\n\r\nThe support for other big data components on Rocky 9 is controlled by the Apache Bigtop project. Additionally, I recommend that you first submit your code as a PR, so that some initial review and suggestions can be made.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2328049368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2330508317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3809#issuecomment-2330508317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3809","id":2330508317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c6K6Lwd","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-05T03:07:36Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T03:07:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

@vishalsuvagia  The reason for the test failures is quite tricky. When ambari-server introduces ambari-admin, it compiles the admin module using the frontend-maven-plugin. At the same time, within the `stage('Parallel Unit Tests')`, both ambari-server and Ambari WebUI Tests run concurrently. This means the frontend-maven-plugin for the ambari-admin module, the Ambari WebUI Tests stage, and the ambari-web module all run simultaneously. This leads to mutual interference affecting npm-related operations, resulting in npm-related errors. The solution is to run the Ambari WebUI Tests stage and the ambari-server tests sequentially instead of in parallel.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2425794867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2426116171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3844#issuecomment-2426116171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3844","id":2426116171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c6Qm5hL","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-21T09:27:34Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T09:27:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arshadmohammad I have added the usage of Ruff involved in this PR to the description.
