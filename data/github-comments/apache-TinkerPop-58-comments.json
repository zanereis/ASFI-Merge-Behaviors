Even with full date-times, there is some context dependence if the time zone is omitted – it defaults to a \"local\" time zone, which has to be predefined. We could assume that a reference timestamp is also predefined, and bound to a specific instant near the beginning of query evaluation. You could have even weirder things than hours and minutes without a date, e.g. seconds and milliseconds without minutes. Is it worth trying to support these oddball cases? Idk, but you could do it...\r\n\r\nto summarize, it sounds as though josh/dave are +0 on having the bare time at all and kelvin has a decent idea with his option 2 if we did support it - i sorta like that better than the jodatime approach of basing from 1970.

I will use the command for my local tests from now on.\r\n\r\nFor the failed test, I am not sure if there is a way to fix this reconnection issue without moving away from “lazy connection”.\r\nFrom my understanding of this issue, it is due to marking a host as “available” and marking client as “initialized” before confirming the host is actually available. After this point, the host are not marked as unavailable/uninitialized, and so the client thinks it’s a valid connection and does not initiate reconnection even when the host later becomes available.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, I’ve made the change so that hosts are not marked as available upon cluster initiation, but marked as available only after successful initialization of connection pools. This would lead to `NoHostAvailableException()` and the client’s `initialized` field remaining false if one connects to a dead host at first, and upon resubmit this would lead to client calling `init()` again inside `submitAsync()`, which would lead to successful reconnection when server/host restarts.\r\n\r\nThis technically breaks the “lazy connection” idea, making it impossible to connect to a non-existent server/host, which caused that test to fail. Confirming host availability at initialization was the most intuitive change, though is “lazy connection” a concept we should hold? Thank you!

me try to phrase it as I understand the situation and tell me if I missed anything.\r\n\r\nAs per the current code base, the definition of client initialisation is that successful connections must have been established with at least one host in the cluster.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when the client is trying to send it's first request, `init()` will be called. `init()` tries to initializes connections across all hosts registered in the cluster and if one of the hosts is down, client will log an error. Note that if the initialization fails, the client will not throw an error or provide any response indicating that initialization has failed. This is intended behaviour because as per the definition of \"successful initialization\", a client is successful if at least one of the host has connected successfully. \r\n\r\nIf no host is successful, then the client initilization **would not fail with a `NoHostAvailableException` exception**. This is because we only throw this exception if the host has been marked as \"available\" in the cluster. It is not necessary for a host to have active connections to be marked as \"available\" in the cluster. Hence, even though connection initilization to the host has failed, host is still marked as \"active\". This will lead to successfully setting `Client.initialized` to true which is incorrect based on the definition of client initialization. \r\n\r\nThe code change in this PR sets a flag `noLiveHostAvailable` if at least one of the hosts fail during client initialization. \r\nOn the next request, it then tries to init() the client again for all the hosts registered in the cluster.\r\n\r\nLet's consider how this change will perform in different cases.\r\n\r\nCase#1: One host registered to cluster and the host is down during client init\r\n\r\nIn such cases, init() will not throw a `NoHostAvailableException` exception. `Client.initialized` will be set to true and `Client.noLiveHostAvailable` will be false. When a second request is made to the client, it will try to init() again and if the host is alive at that time, it will succeed.\r\n\r\nNote that the new flag is doing what the original `Client.initialized` flag should have been doing here.\r\n\r\nCase#2: Multiple hosts registered and only one host is down during client init\r\nIn such cases, init() will not throw a `NoHostAvailableException` exception. `Client.initialized` will be set to true and `Client.noLiveHostAvailable` will be false. When a second request is made to the client, it will try to init() again against all the hosts. This will lead to successful hosts also creating a new connection pool (which is wrong and wasteful).\r\n\r\nDue to above problems in case#2, this PR is not a suitable change.\r\n\r\nI would propose the following alternative:\r\n\r\nA client should:\r\n1. Mark the host as available in the cluster only after connections to the host have been initialised.\r\n2. During client initialization, hosts with successful connections should be marked as available and hosts with unsuccessful connection should be marked as unavailable.\r\n3. If no hosts are successful during client init, NoHostAvailable exception should be thrown to the user and let the user handle this scenario. This is because different applications might have different behaviour. Some might want to fail their application startup while some might want to keep retrying until successful. We should provide this flexibility to the applications to decide this for themselves.\r\n4. If some hosts are successful and some aren't, we should mark the unavailable ones as `considerHostUnavailable()`. This would keep on retrying the failed hosts in the backend while successful hosts are serving existing connections.\r\n\r\nI would suggest you to make the changes to follow the above points and that will make the original test pass (since init() will be called on every call for case of a single host, since client.initialized will be false)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/927738373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/927742342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1481#issuecomment-927742342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1481","id":927742342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc43TDmG","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T10:40:58Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T10:40:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could we also please create a JIRA to write an optimizer to handle empty within()/without() steps from the query?

This follows an \"assume no live hosts unless proven otherwise\" logic. So if there is at last one live host at initiation leading to a successful connection pool, then `Client.noLiveHostAvailable` is set to `false` and it will not re-init() the client.  \r\n\r\nMore specifically, in the case when there are dead hosts among other live hosts, `Client.noLiveHostAvailable` is first set to `true`, and then set to `false` when any live hosts successfully initialized a connection pool inside the async call to `Client.initializeConnectionSetupForHost`. This also leaves `Client.initialized` as `true`, which shouldn’t trigger `Client.init()` at `if (!initialized || noLiveHostAvailable)` inside `Client.submitAsync()`, and if `Client.init()` is somehow called, its `if (initialized && !noLiveHostAvailable)` check would be `true` and any further initialization would be skipped. I believe this should avoid Case#2.\r\n\r\nBut in any case, this change doesn’t resolve the fact that `Client.initialized` is set as `true` when by definition it shouldn’t when no host is available, and I’m working on a way to approach this based on your suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/928255527/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/929114562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1465#issuecomment-929114562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1465","id":929114562,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc43YSnC","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T11:49:35Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T11:49:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"From a backward compatibility angle, I reviewed this CR for the following cases:\r\n\r\n1.

Cluster no longer marks host as available at its `init()`, so all hosts start with the default `isAvailable` as `false`.\r\n2. For ClusteredClients, at `initializeImplementation`, hosts are marked as available inside `initializeConnectionSetupForHost` if Connection Pool can be initialized successfully. At the end of initiating all hosts, if no hosts are available, then `NoHostAvailableException` will be thrown here. If there is at least one host made available, then any unavailable hosts will be passed into `handleUnavailableHosts` along with the executor, which will retry the connection initialization set up in the background through `host.makeUnavailable`, and the client is successfully initiated with the available host(s). \r\n3. For SessionedClients, hosts are randomly chosen, and if a previously marked available host is present, it will be chosen instead. Otherwise, the chosen host is tried and marked as available if Connection Pool can be initialized successfully, and if unsuccessful it will log the error and return to the Client `init()` function to throw the `NoHostAvailableException`. \r\n\r\nNote that for the Gremlin Console remote acceptor test, due to the above changes, `NoHostAvailableException` will be thrown when there is no live server to connect, so I have changed it to assert that remote will throw an exception instead of being successful. Please let me know if it should behave another way (e.g. catch the exception and return an error message instead, etc.)\r\n\r\nPlease also let me know if there are any questions or concerns with the changes.

As it currently sits, we get this behavior now:\r\n\r\n```text\r\ngremlin> :remote connect tinkerpop.server conf/remote.yaml\r\nERROR org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.Client  - Could not initialize client for Host{address=localhost/127.0.0.1:8182, hostUri=ws://localhost:8182/gremlin}\r\nERROR org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.Client  - \r\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused\r\n\tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.checkConnect(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.finishConnect(SocketChannelImpl.java:777)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannel.doFinishConnect(NioSocketChannel.java:330)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.nio.AbstractNioChannel$AbstractNioUnsafe.finishConnect(AbstractNioChannel.java:334)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.processSelectedKey(NioEventLoop.java:707)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.processSelectedKeysOptimized(NioEventLoop.java:655)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.processSelectedKeys(NioEventLoop.java:581)\r\n\tat io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.run(NioEventLoop.java:493)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$4.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:989)\r\n\tat io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\n==>Error during 'connect' - java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot only do we get the big stacktrace, behind the scenes but the `Cluster` object is initialized and would be trying to reconnect to the server when it comes online. I think that the Gremlin Console could handle this issue a bit better by catching the `NoHostAvailableException` explicitly and reporting a more user friendly message, like \"Configured <cluster> <session> but host not presently available\". At that point we could change that test back to what it was and the behavior would be the same as before but with a far nicer message.\r\n\r\nCould you please submit a PR for that to complete this issue? You could submit the work under the same JIRA ticket. \r\n\r\nSome additional details:\r\n\r\n1. The exception is thrown [here](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.4-dev/gremlin-console/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/console/jsr223/DriverRemoteAcceptor.java#L111) so you would just add the catch for `NoHostAvailableException` there.\r\n2. Rather than throw an exception in that catch you would `return` the nice error message\r\n3. A bit of a side issue that I noticed while looking at this was the code path where an exception is propagated from that code in the link above and the `RemoteCommand` handles it [here](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.4-dev/gremlin-console/src/main/groovy/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/console/commands/RemoteCommand.groovy#L55). I feel like something isn't quite right there because a `remote` will never have `close()` called on it to release the `Cluster` object. So maybe there is a leak there? Perhaps you could take a minute to analyze that and see if a little fix is necessary there?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937714100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937756276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1478#issuecomment-937756276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1478","id":937756276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc435QZ0","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T12:44:26Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T12:44:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xiazcy  can we close this PR now given that #1476 has merged?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937756276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937945508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1478#issuecomment-937945508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1478","id":937945508,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc435-mk","user":{"login":"xiazcy","id":55853655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODUzNjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55853655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy","html_url":"https://github.com/xiazcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T16:17:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T16:17:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will do, closing this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937945508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937957666","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1476#issuecomment-937957666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1476","id":937957666,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc436Bki","user":{"login":"xiazcy","id":55853655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODUzNjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55853655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy","html_url":"https://github.com/xiazcy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiazcy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-07T16:26:35Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T16:26:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure, I'll take a closer look into these issues.

I will make that change.\r\n\r\nThanks Stephen!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/937997343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/940028613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1485#issuecomment-940028613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1485","id":940028613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc44B7LF","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-11T13:23:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T13:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for this pull request.

There is solid normative guidance for the allowed schema but there seems to be very little in the way of normative guidance regarding the processing model. The Primer itself is not normative and does not cover all possible cases where the schema allows a `<default>` value. The ambiguity comes from a document such as this one:\r\n```\r\n<graphml xmlns='http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns'>\r\n  <key id='code'    for='node' attr.name='code'    attr.type='string'><default>LHR</default></key>\r\n  <key id='city'    for='node' attr.name='city'    attr.type='string'><default>London></default></key>\r\n  <graph id='routes' edgedefault='directed'>\r\n    <node id='0' label='n1'>\r\n      <data key='city'/>\r\n    </node>\r\n  </graph>\r\n </graphml>  \r\n```\r\nWhen `n1` is created should it have both properties for `code` and `city` created using the default values? The spec provides no guidance (that I can find). I tested using Gephi which is a popular tool for working with various graph file formats. The results from Gephi yield a node with both properties using the default values. In the absence of normative guidance from the GraphML spec itself I would propose we be consistent with Gephi if we add support for default values to help with interchange between other tools, like Gephi, and TinkerPop. Given that a document can override the global default locally should it need to, to really generate a node with an empty string, that would seem to allow for all cases.\r\n```\r\n<graphml xmlns='http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns'>\r\n  <key id='code'    for='node' attr.name='code'    attr.type='string'><default>LHR</default></key>\r\n  <key id='city'    for='node' attr.name='city'    attr.type='string'><default>London></default></key>\r\n  <graph id='routes' edgedefault='directed'>\r\n    <node id='0' label='n1'>\r\n      <data key='city'> <default></default></data>\r\n    </node>\r\n  </graph>\r\n </graphml>    \r\n``` ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/947604873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/950378846","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1485#issuecomment-950378846","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1485","id":950378846,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc44paFe","user":{"login":"amatiushkin","id":47459964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDU5OTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47459964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin","html_url":"https://github.com/amatiushkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amatiushkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T19:14:34Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T19:14:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok. I think it make sense to introduce different strategies for importing default values. \r\n\r\nGiven the impact of this change, I would propose following strategies:\r\n- default (interim) — defaults are not imported at all, similar to current implementation. \r\n- Gephi-like — default are imported like in Gephi (all defaults are assigned, unless overwritten)\r\n- explicit — only exact defaults are assigned (empty, self-closing nodes are ignored)\r\n- soft — empty and self-closing nodes are overwriting default values if possible\r\n- custom — user defines behavior as combination of above\r\n\r\nThe list of exact features is not fully know to me, but I can highlight few things:\r\n- default value has been assigned to a node/edge \r\n- node/edge has data element which refers to a key with default value\r\n- data element in node/edge defines default value\r\n\r\nThese features needs to be listed in a specification-like fashion in  the documentation.
