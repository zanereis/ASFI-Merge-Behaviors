Apparently the cmake-generator-expresssion TARGET_SONAME_FILE does not work with dll libraries. Btw strange, because it does work with mac dylib libraries.\r\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html\r\n\r\n2) Support pthread. Celix thread and mutex support is build on top of pthread. To get Celix running on windows the easiest way would be to support pthread. If I am correct this can be done with cygwin. \r\n\r\n2) Be able do dynamically load dll libraries \r\nCelix uses a load library abstraction:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/celix/blob/master/libs/framework/src/celix_library_loader.h\r\nAnd currently there is only a dlopen implementation, but In the beginning of Celix (around 2010/2011) we also had an DLL loading abstraction. This could be reintroduced (i.e. compile a  celix_windows_library_loader.c instead of celix_library_loader.c on windows).  \r\n\r\n4) If I am correct with windows C/C++ functions need to explicitly declared exported in a library. This is currently not done and needs to be done for lib framework, utils and the bundle activators.\r\n\r\n5) Setup a CI pipeline to ensure Celix works and keeps working for a windows environment. \r\n\r\nHopefully this helps in getting a better overview were Celix stands with respect for Windows support.

Is this related to the issue with cache directories?\r\n\r\nOne of the use case I am struggling with is how to make it possible for Celix users to \"just install an application\" which uses Celix.\r\n\r\nIf you use Celix to create a nice application (e.g. myapp) which uses different bundles. You can install the bundles, but not really the executable created with the cmake function `add_celix_container`.\r\n\r\nWhen starting the installed executable (e.g. /usr/local/bin/myapp) it needs to find the bundles. This can be achieved by the config property CELIX_BUNDLES_PATH.. but this needs to be done with env after the executable is installed. Because during install you probably not known which CELIX_BUNDLES_PATH are valid (-> e.g. where will the different bundles be installed).\r\n\r\nIf it possible to create a \"fat celix executable\" with something like:\r\n```\r\nadd_celix_container(myapp\r\n  FATEXE #maybe not the best  name  ... ;)\r\n  BUNDLES Celix::ShellCxx Celix::shell_tui MyBundle\r\n)\r\n```\r\nwhere the bundle zips are embedded in the executable you can avoid this issue. \r\n\r\nOf course a different path could be to add support for bundles a shared libraries instead, but can this be done backwards compatible and do we need to update all Celix bundles as shared library then or provide 2 version (1 as zip bundle and 1 as shared library). \r\n\r\nAn other issues is also indeed the cache directory, because if you install a celix executable (e.g. /usr/local/bin/myapp) it will now create cache dir in the location where you start the executable. IMO this should be a /tmp or spool dir, but this will also mean that the celix application needs to clean its own (and maybe other not running celix executable) cache dirs.

Last time we had a big chunk of work a summary of the reasoning was: \"Thales already signed a CCLA, $contributor already signed an ICLA and the work already contains Apache License v2 headers, so no IP clearance is necessary\". To rephrase from back then:\r\n\r\n> I would think that if the person who submits the PR has the rights to make that contribution, then their ICLA should cover that. See https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html for more info.\r\n\r\nAnd 'the rights to make that contribution' being that Thales already has a CCLA submitted and $contributor being allowed to submit contributions. From the ASF its perspective I'd say we are okay here.\r\n\r\nThread when starting an IP clearance procedure for the websocket

(as the version suggest, minor update).\r\n\r\nThat said, for Celix backwards compatible means that it is backwards compatible on source level. Although backwards compatibility on binary level would be nicer, this is (IMO) hard to achieve in all situations. In other words I expect recompilation is needed, this is especially true for bundles based on Celix's C++ header only API.\r\n\r\nCould you retry with a recompilation step?\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nPepijn","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/826663730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/826798409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/339#issuecomment-826798409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/339","id":826798409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNjc5ODQwOQ==","user":{"login":"tira-misu","id":6527395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjczOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6527395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu","html_url":"https://github.com/tira-misu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tira-misu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-26T12:33:29Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T12:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Pepijn,\r\n\r\nThanks for the hint with the C++ header only API. This was indeed the missing link and it helps to be binary compatible with old versions. I had a deep dive in to celix sources (ok - it was more or less only scrathing at the surface) and found the incompatible change between 2.1 and 2.2. Old celix bundles creates an own dependency manager and new celix gives the dependency manager to the bundle. So you set the old C interface to deprecated. Changing the implentation of the deprecated interface to the new behaviour in celix 2.2 solves the issue. Bundles build with 2.1 can now be loaded with 2.2 celix runtime. All components with interfaces will be found and linked to dependent bundles. \r\n\r\nI will make a pull request. Perhaps I have overlooked something. \r\n\r\nIn general: Binary compatibility should be a main goal of a modular software framework. In particular if major version did not change. What about to implement a component test for this? I would like to offer a contribution of such a test.\r\n\r\nregards\r\nGunter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/826798409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/829196784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/340#issuecomment-829196784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/340","id":829196784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTE5Njc4NA==","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T12:28:27Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T12:28:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, thanks for the pull request","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/829196784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/829200374","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/339#issuecomment-829200374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/339","id":829200374,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTIwMDM3NA==","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T12:33:43Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T12:33:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n> In general: Binary compatibility should be a main goal of a modular software framework.

PhenZheng, \r\n\r\nI think a new Celix release is overdue, so if there is a desire we can plan this. \r\n\r\nIMO a 2.3.0 release is possible and 2.2.2 release is not needed. \r\n\r\nThe development concerning the C++ remote services and some other items are not stable, but I think it would be enough to default disable the building of these bundles and print a cmake warning when enabled. \r\n\r\nConcerning the C++ development on Celix framework, I consider this not feature complete, but stable enough.\r\n\r\nAre there any other specific issue that needs te be solved from your point of view?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/854037225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/859301204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/350#issuecomment-859301204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/350","id":859301204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1OTMwMTIwNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-11T06:12:08Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T06:12:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

However, the \"use\" on the event loop is another story, the current implementation is expensive when high resolution timer is enabled on Linux:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n    do {\r\n        eventId = celix_framework_fireGenericEvent(ctx->framework, -1, celix_bundle_getId(ctx->bundle), \"use service tracker for celix_bundleContext_useServiceWithOptions\", &data, celix_bundleContext_useServiceWithOptions_2_UseServiceTracker, NULL, NULL);\r\n        celix_framework_waitForGenericEvent(ctx->framework, \r\n        if (!useServiceIsDone) {\r\n            usleep(10);      //This might be too short when HR timer is enabled\r\n        }\r\n    } while (!useServiceIsDone);\r\n```\r\nI'm thinking about this and planning another PR, which will be posted when I've considered all corner cases. Anyway, this should be the topic of another thread.\r\n\r\nI agree that the overhead of locking/unlocking the mutex when accessing `called` and `count` is insignificant. I'm OK keeping them if you insist. I realized with the mutex removed, these celix_bundleContext_useServiceWithOptions_x utility functions can be reused directly, i.e. introducing as little modification as possible. The only thing I have to do is to convince you that it will cause no problem ;)\r\n\r\nLet me borrow Listing 5.2. (Reading and writing variables from different threads) from C++ Concurrency in Action:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include <vector>\r\n#include <atomic>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\nstd::vector<int> data;\r\nstd::atomic<bool> data_ready(false);\r\nvoid reader_thread()\r\n{\r\n    while(!data_ready.load())                   //1\r\n    {\r\n        std::this_thread::sleep(std::chrono::milliseconds(1));\r\n    }\r\n    std::cout<<\"The answer=\"<<data[0]<<\"\\n\";   //2\r\n}\r\nvoid writer_thread()\r\n{\r\n    data.push_back(42);                         //3\r\n    data_ready=true;                            //4\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> The required enforced ordering comes from the operations on the std:: atomic<bool> variable, data_ready;, they provide the necessary ordering by virtue of the memory model relations happens-before and synchronizes-with. The write of the data 3 happens before the write to the data_ready flag 4, and the read of the flag 1 happens before the read of the data 2. When the value read from data_ready 1 is true, the write synchronizes with that read, creating a happens-before relationship. Because happens-before is transitive, the write to the data 3 happens before the write to the flag 4, which happens before the read of the true value from the flag 1, which happens before the read of the data 2, and you have an enforced ordering: the write of the data happens before the read of the data and everything is OK. Figure 5.2 shows the important happens-before relationships in the two threads.\r\n\r\nUsing the book's term, we order non-atomic operations on `data` through the use of atomic operations on `data_ready`. Then I made little modification to the above example to mimic our code's behavior:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include <vector>\r\n#include <atomic>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\nstd::atomic<bool> data_ready(false);\r\nbool called; //for use service\r\nsize_t count; //for use services\r\n\r\nvoid reader_thread()\r\n{\r\n    while(!data_ready.load())                   //1\r\n    {\r\n        std::this_thread::sleep(std::chrono::milliseconds(1));\r\n    }\r\n    std::cout<<\"The answer=\"<<called<< count <<\"\\n\";   //2\r\n}\r\nvoid writer_thread()\r\n{\r\n    called = true;\r\n    count = 3;\r\n    data_ready=true;                            //4\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf we agree the quoted example is correct, then it's straightforward to see the modified one is also correct. To see why my patch is correct, we need to make sure that POSIX mutex provides similar higher level semantics to atomic-operations, which is indeed the case. Again, I quote the book:\r\n\r\n>std::mutex, std::timed_mutex, std::recursive_mutex, std::recursive_timed_mutex: All calls to lock and unlock, and successful calls to try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until, on a given mutex object form a single total order: the lock order of the mutex. A call to unlock on a given mutex object synchronizes with a subsequent call to lock, or a subsequent successful call to try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until, on that object in the lock order of the mutex. Failed calls to try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until do not participate in any synchronization relationships.\r\n\r\n> std::condition_variable and std::condition_variable_any: Condition variables do not provide any synchronization relationships. They are optimizations over busy-wait loops, and all the synchronization is provided by the operations on the associated mutex.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I claim the mutex is unnecessary because `celix_framework_waitForGenericEvent` already provides all synchronization we need (through the mutex semantics). Pthread library really make multi-threading much more intuitive, otherwise the concurrency world is rocket science.\r\n\r\nPlease forgive this non-native English speaker if I failed to explain my thoughts clearly.\r\n\r\nPS: C version explanation is given in Chapter 19 of [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/), which is freely available. C++11 and C11 memory model is essentially the same thing, thus the above also applies to C.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/965961677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/966087853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/377#issuecomment-966087853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/377","id":966087853,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs45lVSt","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-11T08:26:58Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T08:26:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/377?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#377](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/377?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (13ab918) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/commit/bb9179a68fdadda8a4ad3cf79cb7ded0e0db96b6?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (bb9179a) will **increase** coverage by `0.00%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 13ab918 differs from pull request most recent head 5216a30.
