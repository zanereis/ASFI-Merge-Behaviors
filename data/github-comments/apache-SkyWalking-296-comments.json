Skywalking has an abstraction for a Span and a Metric. With Micrometer 1.10.x we are introducing a new abstraction called Observation which could actually in cases of Timer like metrics be reconsidered to be used instead of other abstractions. That way depending on what you have on the classpath you could then trigger metric and span creation yourself. \r\n\r\nI think we could have a chat about this either here or on Zoom to discuss how we should proceed.
