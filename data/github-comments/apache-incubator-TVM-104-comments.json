I believe the specific documentation issue you ran into is indeed a copy-paste error, which we should fix. Overall though, the documentation is lacking as @jroesch said, and we (who implement more grads) should definitely update it with better descriptions as we work through them.\r\n\r\nFor `collapse_sum_like`, I dug into the TOPI code, and it looks like the general idea is to match up tensor dimensions (starting from the last dimension of both) and reduce them (using sum) until it matches the target shape. If two dims don't match, then the input dim is reduced and squeezed, and we continue trying to match. If they are equal, then do nothing. If the output dimension is 1, then we reduce down to 1.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `A.shape() = (4,5,3)` and `B.shape() = (5, 1)`, then `collapse_sum_like(A, B)` will reduce the 3rd dim of `A` to `1` (i.e. `keepdims=True`), not reduce the 2nd dimension, and then reduce and squeeze (i.e. `keepdims=False`) the 1st dimension. It's unclear to me how this will work for 'mismatched' shapes like `(4,4,4)` and `(3,2)`, since the input will just be completely squeezed (and from what I can tell, there's no error check for this, so maybe this is correct behavior that I don't understand).\r\n\r\nWe also need to think about the best way to verify correctness of these implementations, since currently the numerical tests in TVM are somewhat arbitrary. Your approach seems solid for ensuring correct behavior with respect to existing frameworks. This problem is more general than just for gradients though, and I think we should have a TVM-wide discussion.\r\n\r\nAs for your last point, I think this would be a good idea. I'll try to type up a tutorial of sorts walking through my implementation of softmax once I'm done with my current work. I don't want to write too much more here (and maybe this is already too much), but hopefully this helped. I'll make a more comprehensive post once the PR is ready.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/497977339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/497989108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3227#issuecomment-497989108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3227","id":497989108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Nzk4OTEwOA==","user":{"login":"weberlo","id":36520469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIwNDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36520469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo","html_url":"https://github.com/weberlo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-02T00:54:42Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T00:54:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@u99127 Oh.

Intel appears to preferentially support this form in their examples, and their new DLBoost avx512 vector instructions also appear to preferentially support this form.\r\n> \r\n> `https://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn/ex_int8_simplenet.html`\r\n> \r\n> `https://www.intel.ai/nervana/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2018/05/Lower-Numerical-Precision-Deep-Learning-Inference-Training.pdf`\r\n> \r\n> `These instructions enable lower precision multiplies with higher precision accumulates. Multiplying two 8-bit values and accumulating the result to 32-bits requires 3 instructions and requires one of the 8-bit vectors to be in 𝑢𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑡8(𝑢8) format, the other in 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑡8(𝑠8) format with the accumulation in 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑡32(𝑠32) format.`\r\n\r\nI am sorry, but I fail to get the reasoning between your comment *uint8 will give an extra bit of precision following activations*, and the material you listed. Would you please make it a bit more clear? AFAIK, uint8 and int8 has same value capacity, so there could be no *extra precision*.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/497989823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/497990478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2351#issuecomment-497990478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2351","id":497990478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Nzk5MDQ3OA==","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-02T01:28:44Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T01:28:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackwish \r\nIf relu activations are used, there is no need to use half of the representation space for negative values;

I was expecting this, but did not expect it to come so soon :) Here is a solution: keep a reference to shared_ptr<Session> in both allocated objects, Module, and PackedFunc.\r\n\r\nMore specifically:\r\n- EnterSession will reset the Session::Global to a new Session \r\n- The data, function, and module keep a shared_ptr to the session and use the session through the shared_ptr. Note that during the creation of a Module, the shared_ptr is obtained by Session::Global()\r\n   - Refer to implementation of RPC module, which has a similar problem https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/runtime/rpc/rpc_device_api.cc#L49\r\n- ExitSession is called, Session::Global shared_ptr is reset to nullptr.\r\n- At this moment, the old data, function, and module still keep the reference to the old session shared_ptr, the session is not really \"closed\" until all these resources went out of the scope.\r\n- We need to make sure to compare session ptr when during DeviceAPI::Copy, since you cannot copy a data from a stale session to a new one.\r\n\r\nYou can find these steps shows one design principle: if you rely on global singleton then there will be a destruction order problem(what if your dependent singleton object get destructed before you do). One way to resolve that is to keep a shared_ptr ref to the object so that it won't get destructed until every consumer goes out of scope.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/498050967/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/498056489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3268#issuecomment-498056489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3268","id":498056489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODA1NjQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-02T18:58:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T18:58:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Will this change affect the performance of concat for cpu？\r\n\r\nPreviously ssd_mobilenet1.0_512 cost 1.4437s on arm CPU now it costs 1.4545s.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/498056489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/498091707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3227#issuecomment-498091707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3227","id":498091707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODA5MTcwNw==","user":{"login":"weberlo","id":36520469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTIwNDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36520469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo","html_url":"https://github.com/weberlo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weberlo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T02:20:38Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T02:20:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen This seems like a good solution.

lets try to finalize the high-level design points. Lets first discuss the \r\n# Namespace for the tflite quantize style dialect\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* This should support both symmetric and asymmetric.\r\n* These ops should never go through codegen. They will be lowered to low-level Relay ops (like existing conv, round etc) using FForwardRewrite or similar kind of Relay infrastructure.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nHow about using `relay.op._quantization` as the namespace? So, the operations can be `relay.op._quantization.conv2d` or `relay.op._quantization.quantize`.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n* Separation of concerns - Restricts the number of ops for which TVM compute has to be written.\r\n* Good readability/debugging - Framework parsing will be easier compared to directly lowering to low-level Relay ops. Also, one can look at the quantized annotation ops and understand the quantization flow.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n* Getting the best performance might require some new Relay passes. It might require working on a peephole optimizer or some complicated fusion. (Symmetric quantization might already work very well with existing Relay infrastructure. Asymmetric most probably will need more efforts.)\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on this. As we achieve consensus, I can start prototyping these operators with stubbing implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/498749597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/498752465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3278#issuecomment-498752465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3278","id":498752465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODc1MjQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-04T16:47:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-04T16:47:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks,
