Instead, these tests should focus on runtime safety and correctness:\r\n* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python, they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.\r\n* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.\r\n* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints\r\n* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python, a __NameError__ is raised which will halt/crash the script on the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/892914202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/892916377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8658#issuecomment-892916377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8658","id":892916377,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41ONKZ","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-04T19:29:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T19:29:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM,

I changed the PR description with more details.\r\n> Before the timeout was manually set inside the `read_line` function and it was 10sec. Now, I changed it to 60s.\r\n> I changed the commit message as well.\r\n\r\nI see now. You're changing values 5s (for writing) and 10s (for reading) for the transport both to 70s right? (You said 60s above but I see `timeout_sec = 70` - is there a catch in the code here or it was just a typo in your comment above?).\r\n\r\nSo what confused me is that in your first comment in the first commit of the patchset where you add the new parameter `timeout_sec` you actually increase the timeout value for both read and write to 100 seconds and then, on the second commit, you decrease the timeout_sec value to 70 seconds, so when both commits are squashed (pity Github squashes it before merging... but that's another story) you're right, it will amount to a increase in the timeout to 70s (for both read and write). So, if I'm following it correctly, the suggestion I have is to split better next time the patchset, like not saying a commit adds a parameter and the code adds a parameters plus does other changes like modifying other values (like the timeout_sec for read and write). That eases a lot the review process, specially for more complex changes.\r\n\r\nYour second commit message version is better but I think you could s/change/Increase/ and s/a reasonable value/70 seconds/ to inform to the readers more precisely what that commit does when applied (maybe next time, so feel free to change at will or only when you get more reviews). Anyways, just as an example, I would split them as:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/gromero/tvm/commit/8a6277d9479b04a392dc3711990f0504f62bc844 - Add 'timeout_sec' parameter\r\n2. https://github.com/gromero/tvm/commit/532fe2b81c812e5621eadbb24391d3b50a7ebaf7 - Increase test timeout to 70 sec\r\n\r\nFinally, about the code itself, just out of curiosity, I'm wondering if 70 seconds isn't too much for a device to reply in this case. In your experiments have you tried any smaller value?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/894525227/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/894568511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8679#issuecomment-894568511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8679","id":894568511,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41Ugg_","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-06T23:44:37Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T23:44:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PyTorch resnet 18 is tested on every CI job, https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/874ea7a81d91857a2495892c598a8b3b87a6da64/tests/python/frontend/pytorch/test_forward.py#L2030.
