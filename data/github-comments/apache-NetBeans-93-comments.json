That's completely orthogonal topic...\r\n\r\nit is not as orthogonal as it may seem and also fairly independent from UI or user workflow. The situation changed with auto-nb-javac being very similar to javac of the same version. I would not have asked the same question of manual-nb-javac v11 running on JDK 11. Running auto-nb-javac v17 on JDK 17 gives no benefit. I think discussing this before integrating auto-nb-javac to at least have a general idea how to proceed does not hurt, even when not everything is solved in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/951804182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/951825372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3206#issuecomment-951825372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3206","id":951825372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M44u7Pc","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T11:05:36Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T11:09:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mbien: The range of JDKs our users use is broad.

Considering just JDK17, even minor changes in javac in its patch releases can potentially affect IDE's operation. With bundled Javac (e.g. the automatically generated one), Apache NetBeans controls (and can test before update) what version will be shipped with a release. We have no such control over user's execution evnironmnet. If we do some magic depending on the actual runtime of the user, the user may face \"random\" errors depending on automatic OS updates (newer JDK patch release installed) etc.\r\n> \r\n> I am against introducing such magic, and if so, it should be opt-in, not the default.\r\n\r\nThanks for answering. Thats actually the first time i got an answer for that question. The concern is that a JDK update release could introduce incompatible changes, so it is safer to run nb-javac N on JDK N instead of using the JDK's compiler - understood, \r\n\r\nHowever, if it is undesired to provide a way to conditionally disable nb-javac for N+1 too, it will make it impossible to test upstream JDK versions unfortunately, since NB will use the backported javac instead of the compatible one, I used NB for it so far since it made sense to run an IDE which also uses the compiler of the underlying ea JDK you want to test, but there are other options.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/952239996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/952244860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3227#issuecomment-952244860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3227","id":952244860,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M44whp8","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T19:28:02Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T19:28:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

think I found the issue and I think it is a bug in Jackpot. The exception is raised when the fake class for `JCVariableDecl` is being created. The constructor is looked up with \r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew Class<?>[] {JCModifiers.class, Name.class, JCExpression.class, JCExpression.class, VarSymbol.class}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew Class<?>[] {JCModifiers.class, Name.class, JCExpression.class, JCExpression.class, VarSymbol.class, List.class}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code, that does the lookup is found here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/76448e5011d37650a804a9a1c4fdf36f676807f3/java/spi.java.hints/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/hints/spiimpl/JackpotTrees.java#L88-L100\r\n\r\nJDK 17 declares 3 constructors for `JCVariableDecl` (see: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk-17+35/src/jdk.compiler/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javac/tree/JCTree.java#L983-L1016)\r\n\r\n1. `JCModifiers, Name, JCExpression, JCExpression, VarSymbol`\r\n2. `JCModifiers, Name, JCExpression, JCExpression, VarSymbol, boolean`\r\n3. `JCModifiers, JCExpression, JCExpression`\r\n\r\nOnly the first constuctor lookup described at the start of this article is relevant, as the second lookup does not match none of the constructors. The issue is, that the first lookup has to matching constructors: 1 + 2.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed debugging I see this:\r\n\r\n**Working case (Zulu, Adoptium)**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179736/139313875-ad7235b6-b6a9-4480-94ba-9e866fc2eb4e.png)\r\n\r\n**Failing case (Ubuntu JDK 11)**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2179736/139313949-ea7bce06-ddde-45ca-ab40-5f2a8c67502f.png)\r\n\r\nIn the failing case, the constructor has the required minimum number of parameters (check in line 89) and starts with the right parameter types (check in lines 91-95), but the final primitive boolean parameter is most probably the problem. In line 99 missing parameters are replaced with `null`. Now the VM either throws because it can't unbox `null` to a `boolean` or because a primitive can't be set from a reference.\r\n\r\nThe problem is present on both JDKs, it only materializes on the Ubuntu JDK, because there the constructors are returned in a different order, than on the Zulu and Adoptium builds. But this is _not_ a bug in Ubuntu, as there is no guaranteed order (at least it is missing from the method documentation: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Class.html#getConstructors())\r\n\r\nI think `JackpotTrees#createInstance` could be stabilized by\r\n- preferring exactly matching constructors\r\n- ignoring constructors, that can't be satisfied by extending parameter list with null (i.e. which have primitive arguments beyond the supplied arguments)\r\n\r\n@jlahoda what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/954103511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/954227504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3206#issuecomment-954227504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3206","id":954227504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M444Fsw","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-28T21:22:35Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T21:22:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing great investigations!

There is also a bytebuddy code path selectively calling the `JCCase(JCExpression pat, List<JCStatement> stats)`constructor which doesn't exist anymore in modern JDKs, CaseKind is also deprecated for removal, so there will be another change in future.\r\n\r\nI did the following:\r\n * direct constructor matching, no variable guessing anymore\r\n * added typesafe utility methods to JackpotTrees to keep the fragile code in one place, hopefully making it easier to update\r\n \r\n lets see if the tests are ok with it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/955130654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/955204836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3287#issuecomment-955204836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3287","id":955204836,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M4470Tk","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-30T12:54:15Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T12:54:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mishrasandeep please have a look at this change","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/955204836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/955360055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3287#issuecomment-955360055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3287","id":955360055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M448aM3","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-30T15:46:18Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T15:46:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing +1 and happy to merge this one into delivery if you want (it's bugging me too!).

The following code is activated on JDK-11 when executing `assertProjectAction(prj, ActionProvider.COMMAND_BUILD)`:\r\n```\r\n                } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n                    io.getErr().println(Bundle.NO_PLATFORM(ex.getMessage()));\r\n                    gradleTask.finish(1);\r\n                    return;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\ne.g. there is no platform. That is likely caused by the `JavaPlatformImpl` being one folder up because `System.getProperty(\"jdk.home\")` property is set to `jdk-11/..`. Surprisingly the wrong assignment happens in core platform. The following change fixes the problem on JDK-11:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/platform/core.startup/src/org/netbeans/core/startup/Main.java b/platform/core.startup/src/org/netbeans/core/startup/Main.java\r\nindex 569fa9e182d3..5ef02aa4e052 100644\r\n--- a/platform/core.startup/src/org/netbeans/core/startup/Main.java\r\n+++ b/platform/core.startup/src/org/netbeans/core/startup/Main.java\r\n@@ -204,7 +205,11 @@ public final class Main extends Object {\r\n         jdkHome = System.getProperty(\"java.home\");  // NOI18N\r\n \r\n         if (!BaseUtilities.isMac()) {\r\n-            jdkHome += File.separator + \"..\";  // NOI18N\r\n+            File jdkUp = new File(jdkHome).getParent(); // NOI18N\r\n+            File bin = new File(jdkUp, \"bin\"); // NOI18N\r\n+            if (new File(bin, \"javac\").exists() || new File(bin, \"javac.exe\").exists()) { // NOI18N\r\n+                jdkHome = jdkUp.getPath();\r\n+            }\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         System.setProperty(\"jdk.home\", jdkHome);  // NOI18N\r\n```\r\nI think the real change is going to need a bit more love.
