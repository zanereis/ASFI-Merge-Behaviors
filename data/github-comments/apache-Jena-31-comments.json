So you have two options\r\n\r\n1. Edit the generated file and make it the way you want - javacc doesn't overwrite existing files. It's a \"feature\" if you will but probably looks like a hack to the modern developers :)\r\n2. Use the USER_CHARSTREAM option and implement your own charstream - based on the default one.\r\n\r\nBut like I originally said, it's best and more performant to use lexical states. For example if it's triple quoted and you don't allow triple quotes in the literal, you can use lexical states and do:\r\n\r\n<DEFAUL> MORE: { \"'''\" : QUOTED_CONTENT }\r\n\r\n<QUOTED_CONTENT> TOKEN : { <TRIPLE_QUOTED_LITERAL: \"'''> : DEFAU:T } \r\n<QUOTED_CONTENT> MORE :  { <~[]> }\r\n\r\nThat just keeps building your literal without actually affecting the chrastream. The performance difference could be huge here - like 10x even as it will start eating the chars one by one until it sees a ''' so no buffering in the stream required as there is no backtracking! And the image of the literal is built using the standard StringBuilder which is hopefully smarter implementation. So I suggest doing that option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1177743061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1177770146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1324#issuecomment-1177770146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1324","id":1177770146,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5GM1ii","user":{"login":"SimonBin","id":10867832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODY3ODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10867832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonBin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonBin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T15:12:39Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T15:15:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"in this case it's a single doublequoted wktLiteral or gmlLiteral automatically injected by Jena into a SERVICE clause as outlined in my initial report\r\n\r\nand the bug is JavaCC not defaulting to exponential buffer expansion\r\n\r\nthis deficiency is basically able to Denial-of-Service a Fuseki server just with a simple SPARQL query","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1177770146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1177782898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1324#issuecomment-1177782898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1324","id":1177782898,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5GM4py","user":{"login":"new-javacc","id":20192685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTkyNjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20192685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc","html_url":"https://github.com/new-javacc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/new-javacc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T15:21:37Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T15:21:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Still the same idea works.
