This means the code associated with the action is downloaded into the controller causing a spike in the used heap. Garbage collection is then performed to lower the used heap. The same action is then invoked three times without the previous heap increase since the action is now cached, which does not cause a fetch from the DB.\r\n\r\nDifferences in the above graphs can been seen after garbage collection is performed. The non-modified controller contains a cache of the action's zip file causing that controller to consume more heap space than the modified controller. The difference in heap usage appears to be about 100MB after GC is performed.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the large spike in heap usage incurred during a cache miss.

@cbickel what do you think about changing this emit in the activation view:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    emit([doc.namespace+PATHSEP+doc.name, doc.start], value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich doesn't permit filtering by a package to extract the package name from the path annotation, and instead:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    let pkg = getPackageFromAnnotation(doc.annotations) || \"default\"\r\n    emit([doc.namespace+PATHSEP+pkg+PATHSEP+doc.name, doc.start], value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere we prefix the package name if it exists, or \"default\" to normalize the strings for a missing package.\r\n\r\nthis will allow matching/filtering on an action either in the default package or a named package (but not a binding, which we dont track in an activation).\r\n\r\ni could do that in a subsequent PR since it will involve some CLI sugaring as well pending feedback.\r\n\r\nEdit: I investigated a bit more. We wouldn't need 'default' as a prefix. Here's a possible path suffix to add to the view.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  var pathFilter = function(doc) {\r\n    for (i = 0; i < doc.annotations.length; i++) {\r\n      var a = doc.annotations[i];\r\n      if (a.key == \"path\") try {\r\n          var p = a.value.split(PATHSEP);\r\n          if (p.length == 3) {\r\n            return p[1] + PATHSEP + doc.name;\r\n          } else return doc.name;\r\n      } catch (e) {\r\n        return doc.name;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return doc.name;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as noted before, we lose information about a binding fairly early, so all activations are either wrt to the package name or default package. It would seem off though to have a package indexed activation which may not be a name native to the namespace.\r\n\r\nPlus, the API change is a bit more subtle. The filter today is an EntityName, and hence not ambiguous. Should its type change to EntityPath or more strictly a FullyQualifiedEntityPath which is the outward facing type for other APIs dealing with names. The latter is cleanest but then it's an API breaking change, or we have to maintain backward compatibility in the controller (Either[EntityName, FullyQualifiedName] for example). I think we can defer this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333138595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333138713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1635#issuecomment-333138713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1635","id":333138713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzEzODcxMw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T14:17:26Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T14:17:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See

There will probably be no side effects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333370765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333372789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2466#issuecomment-333372789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2466","id":333372789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzM3Mjc4OQ==","user":{"login":"misl","id":2040396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2040396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl","html_url":"https://github.com/misl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-01T12:18:14Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T12:18:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is my custom [Openwhisk Java Client](https://github.com/misl/openwhisk-client-java) I gave the following a try:\r\n```\r\n        \"KeyValue\": {\r\n            \"required\": [\r\n                \"key\",\r\n                \"value\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"properties\": {\r\n                \"key\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\r\n                },\r\n                \"value\": {\r\n                    \"type\": \"object\",\r\n                    \"description\": \"Any JSON value\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately every action invocation gives me a bad request. But this is due to retrofit automatically URL encoding the slash after the package name in the actionName:\r\n```\r\n  @POST(\"namespaces/{namespace}/actions/{actionName}\")\r\n  Call<Activation> invokeAction(\r\n    @Path(\"namespace\") String namespace, @Path(\"actionName\") String actionName, @Body KeyValue payload, @Query(\"blocking\") String blocking, @Query(\"result\") String result, @Query(\"timeout\") Integer timeout\r\n  );\r\n```\r\nI see 2 possible option around this:\r\n\r\n1. Modify Swagger CodeGen to add `encoding = false` to the [@Path](url) annotation. Side effect would be that other special characters in the actionName are no longer URL encoded. (Question: are special characters allowed in package and action names?)\r\n2. Modify the Openwhisk URI swagger file to explicitly mention the package name and the action name in the package. Effectively changing:\r\n```\r\n@POST(\"namespaces/{namespace}/actions/{actionName}\")\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n@POST(\"namespaces/{namespace}/actions/{packageName}/{actionName}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best option?

may have not done a good job of explaining the motivation for this PR.  \r\n\r\nGetting a working docker-runc is touchy because you need an exact version match between the invoker container and the host.  @ddragosd is trying to fix that by mounting the binaries from the host.  I also experimented with that in the kube context, but just mounting the binaries isn't enough (at least on kube as made available on Bluemix). docker-runc from the kube worker node also has dependencies on libAppArmor, so there is more junk to drag in.  I haven't gotten that to work (and I'm not 100% sure it can be made to work reliably), so I thought bringing back the option to bypass runc to a lower performance option might be better to get some container reuse might be better than getting no reuse at all.   But maybe I'm wrong (is no reuse better than docker pause/unpase?)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333666775/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333672882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2736#issuecomment-333672882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2736","id":333672882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzY3Mjg4Mg==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T21:38:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T21:38:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Makes sense to me @jthomas; 3.8 is out.\r\nI'm ok pinning to 3.x.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333672882/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/333680966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2828#issuecomment-333680966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2828","id":333680966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzY4MDk2Ng==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T22:16:38Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T22:16:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should we fold this into the `DockerClient` to avoid needing to pass around the flag?

and save this information next time it needs to `pause`/`resume` a container. `pause`/`resume` would only work when the binary inside the Invoker container is compatible with `runc` on the host, otherwise we're getting: ```stderr: json: cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type []string``` . #2799 solves this error by mounting `runc` from the host, but it only works if `runc` doesn't have other dependent libraries.\r\n\r\n@dgrove-oss in the current kube deploy that you're testing with, I assume the binary on the host is compatible with the binary in the invoker and you didn't get the `unmarshall` error
