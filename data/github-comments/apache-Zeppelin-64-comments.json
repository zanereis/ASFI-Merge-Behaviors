actually, last time I tested, the about dropdown was doing great on mobile\n\n@minahlee I still prefer separated one, mainly because you won't always have a user, and\nhaving a dropdown under Connected/Disconnected is misleading and doesn't give much indications.\nThe thing about settings is that it describes well what you will find inside: settings\n\nIn the case of website separating them, we can list JIRA and Gmail:\n<img width=\"155\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-16 at 11 11 40 am\"

role: What is under user (if there is one), should be related to the user: Logout. And what is under setting should be related to the instance/software: Interpreter, Credentials, Configuration,
