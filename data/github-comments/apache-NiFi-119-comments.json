We can just prompt the user to apply the deletion to the parameter context before attempting to recreate a parameter with the same name. Thoughts??? Does it matter if they are trying to recreate the parameter with the same sensitivity? At that point it is just an update to that parameter right???","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/525013059/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/525035062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3669#issuecomment-525035062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3669","id":525035062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTAzNTA2Mg==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T21:13:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T21:13:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MikeThomsen thanks!

Lot's good stuff here. This has been merged to master. One issue I found that we should address in the future... \r\n\r\nIf the user does not have read access to the Process Group and they attempt to update a parameter context, they can access the Parameters context menu item if we are in the group in question. However, they cannot access the Parameters context menu item if they are in the parent group and select the group in question on the canvas.

The flow.xml.gz is not the best way to solve for scenarios where a registry is not available. The biggest risk in using the flow.xml.gz directly is that it makes Stateless NiFi look like a drop in replacement for a NiFi node and encourages a usage pattern that avoids version control. Not to mention that the flow.xml.gz was never intended as a public interface, so it could change unexpectedly between versions.\r\n\r\nMiNiFi chose to use templates (XML/YML files) as a way of loading flow definitions without the registry, but it sounds like templates may be on their way out. I will start a discussion thread on the dev list to talk about file-based flow representations and the best solution for when a registry is not available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/526724080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/526732681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3651#issuecomment-526732681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3651","id":526732681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjczMjY4MQ==","user":{"login":"dbkegley","id":5727001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjcwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley","html_url":"https://github.com/dbkegley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbkegley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-30T20:08:51Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T20:08:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"My goal for this was only to remove the requirement of using registry to run stateless flows so I'm in agreement about the points against using the flow.xml.gz.

I found a few things that require some changes but overall this looks great. One other bug I was able to uncover: If you have 2 PG's, say `pg1` and `pg2`, and each PG is configured to leverage the same parameter context, say `pc1`, with a parameter named `param 1`. Now say that each PG has a CS configured such that it has a property that references `param 1`. Now enter into `pg1`. Open the context menu and click to view the Parameters. In the 'Parameters' tab click the row with `param 1` in the table to view the usage of that parameter. Now, go to the referencing CS in `pg2`. You will see the proper shell dialog will open to allow you to view the CS tab of the configurations shell for `pg2` but if you click the gear icon to configure that CS you will see the following error:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-03 at 6 17 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6797571/64213478-17605800-ce7b-11e9-9509-d0aae2e7c6fe.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/527669352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/527859362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3679#issuecomment-527859362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3679","id":527859362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzg1OTM2Mg==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T11:25:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T11:25:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/527859362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/527940977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3543#issuecomment-527940977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3543","id":527940977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzk0MDk3Nw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T15:00:14Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T15:00:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I lost track of this, do you mind rebasing against the latest master?
