However, I do not believe that is the correct behavior (or better said not for all the needed cases). From my understanding of the semantic for OVER - even if the function would work on the time (proctime/eventtime) - we should still emit a value for every incoming event. I have 2 arguments for this:\r\n1) in our scenarios - we would use the current implementation for example to detect certain statistics for every incoming event, while the statistic focus is defined for a certain period of time (this is a functionality that is highly needed). For example if you apply this in a stock market scenario - you might want to say give me the sum of the transactions over the last hour (to verify potentially a threshold for liquidity of the market) and as the application would need to react on each incoming transaction (e.g. decide to buy or not to buy) - then working on the behavior you mentioned would not enable such a scenario. More than this, even if you would need both behaviors ..then what query could you write to have the described behavior and make the differentiation from the other?\r\n2) if you think on the case of event time - which should be similar with proctime - then there it should be the same. When you get an event (ev1 , time1) - you should not emit this output until you would know if there is at some point later another event with the same event time (ev2, time1). Basically you would register the timer for the acceptable watermark/allowedlatency and accumulate the accumulator for a specific event time and emit it after the allowed latency has passed....is this the actual behavior that is implemented / would be implemented?

First of all i am happy that we agree that we need to emit something for every input :). I was scared that this will not be the case\r\n\r\nNow regarding the 2 options for the output - i would still have a preference for the first option. The reason for this is that at least in the case of proctime there is no 2 events that are simultaneous in absolute terms. There is an implicit serialization (also based on how flink engine works...one event will arrive before the other). It might simply be a coincidence that the granularity that the computers now cannot measure system time with more fine granularity...and because of that we would have 2 events which are apparently with the same proc time stamp...\r\nHowever, as you mentioned several times (and i agree) having a uniform behavior might be a key point. In this case we would indeed implement the behavior you suggested. - Let me know again if you are sure about this. I raised my concerns but i am open to accept what you suggest.\r\n\r\nIn case you suggest to implement it with proctimes, i have 2 questions:\r\n1) do you know if there is some example for timer in proc time (if not, now problem -  i will figure it out)\r\n2) in the case of harness tests - the correct implementation of the behavior might not match the test. If i write a test that does\r\n{code}\r\n testHarness.setProcessingTime(3)\r\n testHarness.processElement(new StreamRecord(rInput, 1001))  // let us assume that the system time is 1490906681\r\n testHarness.processElement(new StreamRecord(rInput, 2002))  // let us assume that the system time is still 1490906681\r\n +    testHarness.processElement(new StreamRecord(rInput, 2003))  // let us assume that the system time is now 1490906682\r\n +    testHarness.processElement(new StreamRecord(rInput, 2004)) // let us assume that the system time is now 1490906682\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nin this case if we do a Count, than the output would be\r\nev1 2\r\nev2 2\r\nev3 2\r\nev4 2\r\n...instead of having all with an associated count of 4 (which would be in the behavior you mention). This would be because i would assume that the timer +1ms would be triggered based on system time.\r\nIn such a case - should we just build a limited test that would work?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290540104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290540746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3641#issuecomment-290540746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3641","id":290540746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDU0MDc0Ng==","user":{"login":"rtudoran","id":16573790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTczNzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16573790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran","html_url":"https://github.com/rtudoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T20:49:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T20:49:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ignore question 1 - i found an example in the UnboundedEventTimeOverProcessFunction.scala","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290540746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/290543548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3641#issuecomment-290543548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3641","id":290543548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDU0MzU0OA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T21:00:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T21:00:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are right, with processing time no two records arrive at exactly the same time.

This can be costly. Instead we can pass the `Context` and only invoke the methods when needed.\r\n - I regard `WindowOperatorTest` as legacy, new tests should be added to `WindowOperatorContractTest`. This is a base class with a lot of test cases that is extended by `RegularWindowOperatorTest` and `EvictingWindowOperatorTest`.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are hard to know and it's not obvious what test should go where, sorry for the inconvenience.

good work and thanks for improving the documentation.

I wonder if the different semantics in list state between the operator state and the keyed state can be confusing and error-prone for users and what we could do about this?

Especially if in the future, if both the keyed state _and_ the operator state are registered through the initialization context, it can definitely be confusing if both states have the `getListState` or even `getMapState` ... methods, while they actually have completely different semantics.\r\n\r\nTo address @StefanRRichter's concerns, perhaps we could\r\n1) Try to emphasise the semantic differences in the docs / Javadocs.\r\n2) Consider renaming `getListState` to `getXXXListState`? \"XXX\" needs to imply the round-robin redistribution scheme.\r\n\r\nI was also wondering about another possibility, which follows a completely different approach: `getRepartitionableListState(descriptor, REDISTRIBUTE_MODE)`. This might be able to set it apart from the keyed state counterpart.\r\n\r\nIf no `REDISTRIBUTE_MODE` is given, simple round-robin is used.\r\nFor the union state, we would call `getRepartitionableListState(descriptor, OperatorStateRedistributionPattern.UNION)`.\r\n`OperatorStateRedistributionPattern` would be a new public API that only defines what is currently supported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/291489931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/291515966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3656#issuecomment-291515966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3656","id":291515966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTUxNTk2Ng==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-04T14:24:01Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T14:24:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @fhueske , I had moved the PR to FLINK-6247, and think about how to deal with this JIRA.
