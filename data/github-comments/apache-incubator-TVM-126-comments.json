Or to put it in TOPI with dedicated routine which to be enabled on condition - say, templates. Also, AFAIK, VNNI intends a symmetric approach.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments @jackwish \r\nLet me first give little background why are we doing this\r\n\r\n* Intel Skylake and newer processors have Int8 fast instructions. But they only support u8 x i8. One can legalize the `nn.conv2d` when it sees u8 x i8 and convert it to u8 x i8. However, doing that at `nn.conv2d` involves many more instructions. (It requires instructions before and after conv). Therefore, I decided to do it at `qnn.conv2d`. In this case, we can just worry about the quantized tensors in general as we have information about scales and zero points. Here, we just have to requantize the weight to go from uint8 to int8 and everything is set.\r\n\r\n* `VNNI supports symmetric design.` Yes, that is true. This PR does not change that. The whole flow would be - we have u8 x u8 `qnn.conv2d`. QnnLegalize converts it to u8 x i8 `qnn.conv2d`. QnnCanonicalize will lower the `qnn.conv2d` into Relay ops. The example is \r\n\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n# Original\r\nv0.0.3\r\ndef @main(%data: Tensor[(1, 64, 256, 256), uint8], %kernel: Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), uint8]) -> Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] {\r\n  qnn.conv2d(%data, %kernel, kernel_size=[3, 3], out_dtype=\"int32\", input_zero_point=1, kernel_zero_point=1) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] */\r\n}\r\n\r\n# After QnnLegalize\r\nv0.0.3\r\ndef @main(%data: Tensor[(1, 64, 256, 256), uint8], %kernel: Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), uint8]) -> Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] {\r\n  %0 = cast(%kernel, dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %1 = add(%0, -128 /* ty=int32 */) /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %2 = clip(%1, a_min=-128f, a_max=127f) /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %3 = cast(%2, dtype=\"int8\") /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int8] */;\r\n  qnn.conv2d(%data, %3, kernel_size=[3, 3], out_dtype=\"int32\", input_zero_point=1, kernel_zero_point=-127) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] */\r\n}\r\n\r\n# After QnnCanonicalize\r\nv0.0.3\r\ndef @main(%data: Tensor[(1, 64, 256, 256), uint8], %kernel: Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), uint8]) -> Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] {\r\n  %0 = cast(%kernel, dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %1 = add(%0, -128 /* ty=int32 */) /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %2 = clip(%1, a_min=-128f, a_max=127f) /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %3 = cast(%2, dtype=\"int8\") /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int8] */;\r\n  %4 = nn.conv2d(%data, %3, kernel_size=[3, 3], out_dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] */;\r\n  %5 = cast(%data, dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 256, 256), int32] */;\r\n  %6 = multiply(%5, 9 /* ty=int32 */) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 256, 256), int32] */;\r\n  %7 = nn.avg_pool2d(%6, pool_size=[3, 3]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 254, 254), int32] */;\r\n  %8 = sum(%7, axis=[1], keepdims=True) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1, 254, 254), int32] */;\r\n  %9 = multiply(-127 /* ty=int32 */, %8) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1, 254, 254), int32] */;\r\n  %10 = tile(%9, meta[relay.attrs.TileAttrs][0]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] */;\r\n  %11 = subtract(%4, %10) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] */;\r\n  %12 = cast(%3, dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(128, 64, 3, 3), int32] */;\r\n  %13 = sum(%12, axis=[1, 2, 3]) /* ty=Tensor[(128), int32] */;\r\n  %14 = reshape(%13, newshape=[1, 128, 1, 1]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 1, 1), int32] */;\r\n  %15 = subtract(-73152 /* ty=int32 */, %14) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 1, 1), int32] */;\r\n  add(%11, %15) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 128, 254, 254), int32] */\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the `nn.conv2d` gets the u8 x i8 inputs. Now, we can use Legalize on `nn.conv2d` to use the TOPI templates as you were suggesting.\r\n\r\n* Finally, I can add a guard where if the `target` is Skylake+, only then I will trigger this legalization. That should resolve the concern what happens with older processors\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/528492602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/528511924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3871#issuecomment-528511924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3871","id":528511924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODUxMTkyNA==","user":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T18:21:56Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T18:21:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@masahi can you approve explicitly?

The HW has no notion of asymmetric and symmetric. It will just take two tensors, one uint8 and other int8 and do dot product. So, I don't think asymmetry plays a role at the level of `nn.conv2d`.\r\n\r\nSide note - If suppose both the inputs were symmetric. The `qnn.conv2d` will Canonicalize to just `nn.conv2d`. In that case also, `nn,.conv2d` will only have two tensors, one uint8 and other int8. Whether they were symmetric or not, `nn.conv2d` (and also VNNI) is completely unaware of that.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am missing

should actually be an error!)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/528993639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/528995045","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3910#issuecomment-528995045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3910","id":528995045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODk5NTA0NQ==","user":{"login":"shoubhik","id":2293791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTM3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2293791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik","html_url":"https://github.com/shoubhik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shoubhik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T20:02:33Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T20:02:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anijain2305

Allow me to explain. Let's leave asymmetric, symmetric and VNNI off the discussion for now.\r\n\r\nSuppose, we have a tensor of floating point numbers. We can represent them in one quantized representation `Q_a` with `scale_a` and `zp_a`. So, \r\n\r\n`FP_value = scale_a * (Q_a - zp_a)`\r\n\r\nNow, I can have another quantized representation that can map to the exact same floating point numbers as that `Q_a` tensor.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n`FP_value = scale_a * ( Q_a - zp_a + 128 - 128)`\r\n`FP_value = scale_a * ( (Q_a - 128) - (zp_a - 128))`\r\n\r\nSo, here, we can have another quantized representation `Q_b` with (`scale_a`, `zp_b'), where \r\n\r\n`Q_b = Q_z - 128`\r\n`zp_b = zp_a - 128`\r\n\r\nAny operator that was consuming this tensor as input remains unchanged. It will still get same represented floating point values (only the quantized values and zero point has changed, while the floating point values are still same). \r\n\r\nIn the context of PR, Q_a is `u8` and I want to bring all the values in `i8` range. This can be done by using the above equation. \r\n\r\nEssentially, following thing happens\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n# Original\r\n\r\n        u8       u8\r\n        |        |\r\n        qnn.conv2d\r\n\r\n# After QnnLegalize\r\n\r\n\r\n       u8       u8\r\n        |        |\r\n        |        requantize to i8 using above equations\r\n        |        |\r\n        qnn.conv2d\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf we agree on this, the following comment should also help - https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/42195a48e01c4850a7a89d2ae586740821d76555/python/tvm/relay/qnn/transform.py#L71-L107","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529776665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529784824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3904#issuecomment-529784824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3904","id":529784824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTc4NDgyNA==","user":{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T06:05:34Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T06:05:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinx13 can this be merged?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529784824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529791264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3896#issuecomment-529791264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3896","id":529791264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTc5MTI2NA==","user":{"login":"zhenhuaw-me","id":4936589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzY1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4936589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenhuaw-me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenhuaw-me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-10T06:29:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-10T06:29:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, you are right @anijain2305, I was focus on factorizing `uint8 * int8` too much, leading to misunderstanding of the legalization.\r\n\r\nSorry for the that, and thank you for the kind patient and detailed explain :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/529791264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
