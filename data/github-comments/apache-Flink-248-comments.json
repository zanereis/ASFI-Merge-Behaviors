Indeed org.apache.flink.api.common.typeinfo.BasicTypeInfo#toString should be changed at least to fix case from there.  \r\nAt the same time before going such a way I have 2 questions:\r\n1. is it ok to change public api behavior here (toString is public)?\r\n2. Should we go through all successors of org.apache.flink.api.common.typeinfo.TypeInformation and if its toString looks like clazz.getSimpleName than change it similar to org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.GenericTypeInfo#toString?\r\n\r\ncould you please clarify it and than I could do required

To fix i  t the class `org.apache.calcite.avatica.util.DateTimeUtils` should be changed which is presented in both avatica and flink.\r\nAt the same time different db's provide a little bit different behavior (please have a look at the links below)\r\nlooks like in case of day of week extraction for Oracle, MySql Sunday = 1, for Postgresql Sunday = 0, for Microsoft SQL Server it depends on property set by user\r\nOn the other hand there is a standard [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) which also defines weekday, day of years e.g. This is also a part of [CALCITE-2303](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2303).\r\nSo my suggestion is within this ticket provide support for all operations which could come from [CALCITE-2303](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2303): `dow`, `decade`, `epoch`, `isodow`, `isoyear`, `microsecond` and `millisecond`\r\nHowever yes you are right it is required to choose what approach for dayOfWeek to use.

And the TiKV has already used it to delete entire shards. But, to be on the safe side, I think the current PR should be frozen, but I think the implementation base on `deleteRange()` in this PR should be a better implementation(especially when user scaling up the job, in that case we only need to clip the RocksDB without iterating any records, a super fast way) if the `deleteRange()` is no longer a feature of experimental.\r\n\r\nAnyways, even although we can't use the `deleteRange()` currently, but we can still improve the performance of the incremental checkpoint in somehow. We can improve it the by the follow way: if one of the state handle's key-group is a sub-range of the target key-group range. we can open it directly to prevent the overhead of iterating it. @StefanRRichter What do you think? If you don't object this, I will update the PR follow the above approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/391574919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/391585558","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5306#issuecomment-391585558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5306","id":391585558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTU4NTU1OA==","user":{"login":"suez1224","id":10366341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224","html_url":"https://github.com/suez1224","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suez1224/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T04:38:03Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T04:38:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol

Am I right that you mean `docs/dev/table/sql.md`?\r\n2. Currently I see the general explanation of extract and reserved words where DOW already specified.\r\nFrom this point of view I do not see what could be updated right now. At the same time I have a proposal to go to the similar way as Calcite does. [Here](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html) there is a link to their functions including date/time. Among extract they also have synonyms e.g. \r\n>MONTH(date) | Equivalent to EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date). Returns an integer between 1 and 12.\r\n>WEEK(date) | Equivalent to EXTRACT(WEEK FROM date). Returns an integer between 1 and 53.\r\n>DAYOFYEAR(date) | Equivalent to EXTRACT(DOY FROM date). Returns an integer between 1 and 366.\r\n\r\nand etc.\r\nSo I suggest to introduce the same synonyms in flink (just via usage of existing in Calcite) and organize documentation for them in a similar way\r\n\r\nAnd if you agree then one question: would it be better to create another issue for that or use the same?\r\nI would suggest at least to separate two things:\r\n1. do whatever it is possible right now\r\n2. other stuff which depends on issues, fixes and updates from Avatica/Calcite\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/391649301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/391653537","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6031#issuecomment-391653537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6031","id":391653537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTY1MzUzNw==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T09:40:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T09:40:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks :) I have squashed commits and rebased the PR on latest master.
