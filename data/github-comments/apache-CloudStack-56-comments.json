verify through SSH if I can ping the other side, this doesn't work. Not sure if this is related to this PR, probably not (although this worked Sunday on master). I will do some more investigation and report back. \n\nApart from this the PR seems OK!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/144430354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/144439566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/901#issuecomment-144439566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/901","id":144439566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDQzOTU2Ng==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-30T15:05:05Z","updated_at":"2015-09-30T15:05:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @karuturi for picking this up.

I've been paging through the diff files to see what might be a good candidate for unit testing.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't really see much.\n\nWhat I do see (in terms of added/changed code) is the following:\n- Removal of a constructor (compiler would catch any issues here).\n- Renaming of variables (typically adding a \"_\" before a member variable).\n- Some new setters and getters (technically could do unit testing here to confirm that what we place in the object is what we get out of it, but most of the time we are just directly setting a member variable and retrieving from it, so it's pretty low risk).\n- Adding \"private\" and \"protected\" where previously we had \"public\" (the compiler should catch issues here).\n- Making a previously private method public and making it accessible via an interface.\n- Adding three methods to the HypervisorHostListener interface: hostAdded, hostAboutToBeRemoved, and hostRemoved (but not really having any hooks into the system to be able to \"pretend\" like I'm adding or removing a host).\n- Removing the word \"public\" from the methods of an interface since all methods in an interface are public in Java.\n- Adding three methods to the Listener interface: processHostAdded, processHostAboutToBeRemoved, and processHostRemoved (but not really having any hooks into the system to be able to \"pretend\" like I'm adding or removing a host). Also, this leads to a need to make a simple, default \"do nothing\" implementation of these methods for about 30 classes.\n- Adding an extra command to allow while a host is in maintenance mode (but not having any way to simulate maintenance mode via unit testing).\n- Adding a new command that VmwareResource can respond to. However, the command requires interaction with an ESXi host, so can't really be tested in isolation (i.e. via unit testing).\n- Changes to the way DB locking is performed in a couple scenarios with the SolidFire storage plug-ins (requiring an underlying DB).\n- Reformatting of text to better conform to ACS formatting guidelines.\n- Removal of \"dead\" code that I came across while working on this ticket.\n\nI'd be happy to entertain ideas on unit testing this PR, but I'm thinking we'd get more \"mileage\" here out of adding integration tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/144619954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/144654663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/889#issuecomment-144654663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/889","id":144654663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDY1NDY2Mw==","user":{"login":"borisroman","id":5996146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5996146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman","html_url":"https://github.com/borisroman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T08:30:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T08:30:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@remibergsma @runseb I've ran the test_vm_lifecycle.\n\n[root@cs1 smoke]# nosetests --with-marvin --marvin-config=/data/shared/marvin/mct-zone1-kvm1-basic.cfg -s -a tags=basic,required_hardware=false test_vm_life_cycle\n==== Marvin Init Started ====\n\n=== Marvin Parse Config Successful ===\n\n=== Marvin Setting TestData Successful===\n\n==== Log Folder Path: /tmp//MarvinLogs//Oct_01_2015_10_11_33_MFQA0G.

I then went to the Master router and did:\n\n```\nroot@r-14-VM:~# ip route show\n10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.1.1.213 \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 169.254.0.7 \n192.168.23.0/24 dev eth2  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.23.4 \n```\n\nSo, no default route on RVR routers. I then added them:\n\n```\nroot@r-14-VM:~# route add default gw 192.168.23.1\nroot@r-14-VM:~# ip route show\ndefault via 192.168.23.1 dev eth2 \n10.1.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.1.1.213 \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 169.254.0.7 \n192.168.23.0/24 dev eth2  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.23.4 \nroot@r-14-VM:~# \n```\n\nAfter that, I went back to the VM and ping was successful!\n\n```\n# ping 8.8.8.8\nPING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: seq=0 ttl=48 time=9.765 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: seq=1 ttl=48 time=9.801 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: seq=2 ttl=48 time=9.343 ms\n^C\n--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max = 9.343/9.636/9.801 ms\n# \n```\n\nThis bug is not related with this PR and was not mentioned before - probably nobody tested it.\n\nI would suggest to create a separate issue, which should include the fix and a test to cover it. What do you think?\n\nConcerning the conntrackd, I did the following:\n\n```\nroot@r-14-VM:~# conntrackd -s\nERROR: parsing config file in line (102), symbol 'Multicast': syntax error\nroot@r-14-VM:~#\n```\n\nAs you can see the configuration file is not good!
