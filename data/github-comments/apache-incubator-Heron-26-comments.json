The current round robin algorithm will reduce the memory requirements of each instance to fit into a smaller number of containers. This algorithm will fail.  If I make the autoadjustment as default then this algo will not affect current jobs. They will not fail but they may use more containers than previously. This is because now the memory requirements of each instance are guaranteed to be satisfied. However with homogeneous containers you may end up seeing more resources being used than the current round robin. \n\nI think if you want to guarantee the memory resources per instance, this algorithm is better since it provides the guarantee and can automatically figure out the number of containers. However, if you are fine not providing this guarantee but use fewer homogeneous containers, then you should use the existing algo. In case of YARN, I would recommend the enhanced algo since it can support heterogeneous containers and thus will not waste resources.\n\nThis algorithm supports configurable padding that is added on top of the container_ram defined in the topology. Thus your users, might see slightly bigger containers as it is not assumed that they take padding into account when defining the container size. This is because the padding value is dependent on the number of instances packed in a container and thus is applied after packing.\n\n Let me know if you want me to change the default for auto-adjustment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235691507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235695875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1119#issuecomment-235695875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1119","id":235695875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTY5NTg3NQ==","user":{"login":"prabhuinbarajan","id":4031715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzE3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhuinbarajan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhuinbarajan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T19:37:15Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T19:37:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"fixed all pylint comments\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235695875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/235703271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1160#issuecomment-235703271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1160","id":235703271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTcwMzI3MQ==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T20:03:38Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T21:03:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@avflor - thanks for the detailed explanation. conservatively, can we code this as a separate algorithm - something like Enhanced Round Robin.
