Can you remind me what happens if someone passes in a nested schema for CsvDeltaStreamer?\r\n\r\nI used some code below to test the nested schema for CSV reader in Spark.  It throws the following exception, which means that Spark CSV source does not support nested schema currently.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the CSV schemas should be flattened.  It depends on Spark's behavior whether nested schema is supported for CSV source (in the future nested schema may be supported for CSV).  So we don't enforce the check in our Hudi code. \r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: CSV data source does not support struct<amount:double,currency:string> data type.;\r\n\r\n\tat

For RO views, we use HoodieParquetInputFormat, which does not read log files. For RT views, we use HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat, which reads slice including log files. @bvaradar  is working on fixing any broken windows for supporting incremental reads on RT views.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to include this change for supporting RO views (which is majority of use cases for us). I agree with you that this is additional complexity. I added more tests than usual because of that. \r\n\r\nOther alternatives i can think of:\r\n1) Support incremental reads only for RT views.  incremental reads on RO can fail or use RT (is this your proposal in the above comment?)\r\n2) Instead of doing incremental reads based on hoodie commit time, use parquet file creation times. This approach requires substantial changes and likely be breaking some fundamental assumptions.\r\n\r\nAlso, at a high level, I want to discuss adding additional mode for incremental reads. Today, its responsibility of hoodie users to save commit times and use that for next incremental reads. Can we add 'kafka consumer' model, where consumer only specifies their unique-id. Hudi tracks read progress (perhaps as part of consolidated metadata?). This would simplify usage and make debugging lot easier.\r\n \r\nfyi,  @n3nash is out of office for next 10 days. @bvaradar likely can share more context. Let me know if you have other suggestions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/598409536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/598563329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1396#issuecomment-598563329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1396","id":598563329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODU2MzMyOQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-13T05:55:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T05:55:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">>(is this your proposal in the above comment?)\r\n\r\nyes..
