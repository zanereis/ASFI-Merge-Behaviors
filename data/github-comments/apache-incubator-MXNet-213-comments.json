Considering data parallelism, as each worker works on one partition of the data, if we can monitor\r\n    1) the overall data processed by all the workers (represented by the total number of processed batches for example) \r\n   2) the progress each worker has made (represented by the local processed batches) since the work launched.\r\n   Then it will be very helper for us to have a global view of the ongoing distributed learning process.\r\n2. To be frank, I am new to deep learning, so the following concerns are mostly hypothetical. \r\nOne of the scenario I can come up with is what if there are not enough computation resource for you to do the computation. Although intuitively, the more GPUs we have the quicker the learning process, but we always have a limited number of GPU. Under this circumstances, if we can leverage the computation capacity of the idle CPU cluster in our system, we will get extra performance gain. \r\nAnother concern would be is that possible some of the computation is processed faster on CPU? I know that computation like matrix multiplication will be extremely fast if we use GPU. But I am not sure that is always the case for all kinds of computation in deep learning algorithms.\r\nDo these two concerns make sense to you?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/314923515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/314942176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7003#issuecomment-314942176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7003","id":314942176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDk0MjE3Ng==","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-13T01:19:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T01:19:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM. is the failed lint test not related to these code changes?

In some cases the discrepancy in training times (between CPU and GPU) is so big that you probably are better off waiting for a GPU to become available. You could conceivably use a cluster of CPUs if you are not training the entire network i.e. taking a pre-trained model and fine tuning it with new labeled data. I do think your questions/concerns are valid.
