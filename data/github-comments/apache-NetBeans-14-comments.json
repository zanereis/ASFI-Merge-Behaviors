They might reappear after some kinds of edits, but doing a CLI build is a natural gesture to fix that.\r\n\r\n> I assume this also works with maven builds invoked via \"Clean and Build\" from the project context menu, rather than from the command-line?\r\n\r\nYes, that is what I normally do.\r\n\r\n> Sometimes a clean build has not been enough to resolve this--I've had to restart NetBeans or even delete the cache directory.\r\n\r\nYes, I have done the same on many occasions.\r\n\r\n> If a clean build can now resolve these cases, it makes many other bugs less serious.\r\n\r\nThe intent is indeed to mitigate the impact of other bugs—they still need to be fixed once reproduction steps can be nailed down.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this patch (unlike the one supposedly developed by @jlahoda) does _not_ fix anything from the IDE’s perspective. You may still have error badges, broken code completion, that sort of thing. Its sole purpose is to allow CoS actions (typically running or debugging a single test case) to work, under the assumption that the erroneous classes have no particular relationship to what you are actually working on—the test and the classes being tested—other than that some of the code marked as erroneous happens to get run somewhere deep in the call stack.\r\n\r\nAs an example: if I am working in `jenkinsci/jenkins` on some test that creates a Jenkins project with paraneters and then runs a build step which I just wrote, to see if the build step properly handles parameterized variables, the files I am likely to be editing iteratively are `core/src/main/java/pkg/SomeBuildStep.java` and `test/src/test/java/pkg/SomeBuildStepTest.java` as I work out the kinks. In the course of a test run, hundreds of other classes will get loaded and used, including for example `Job` (superclass of all projects) and `ParametersAction` (captures parameters passed to one project build). Yet before https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/2595 was merged, certain versions of NetBeans would mark both those sources as erroneous, even though `mvn compile` using JDK 8 worked fine. Without this patch, I would be unable to use CoS mode, and would need to fall back to a shell:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn -pl core,test -Dtest=SomeBuildStepTest#smokes -DfailIfNoSpecifiedTests=false test\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich runs all sorts of unrelated goals and is much slower.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/382151819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/382276743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/501#issuecomment-382276743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/501","id":382276743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjI3Njc0Mw==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-18T06:27:06Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T06:27:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It is also important to get the tests in the shape - last time I tried to run all NetBeans tests, they timed out.

yes it is, but it seems incomplete. As far as I understand, it just allows the installation of a custom Authenticator, but when I requested the integration of phansson plugins,  my query was motivated by the fact that the plugins also include advanced proxy PAC support and provide an implementation of an Authenticator that handles much better SPNEGO as the default NBAuthenticator.

I've looked on intellij and it's the same, they will navigate from your project into a pom file, but it doesn't navigate further from there.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at this defect and see where its thrown, then see if there's other locations that could throw an NPE, and resolve them.  Thanks for the help on this @Chris2011

The reason the checked in code isn't using JSON (as I mentioned before) is because something wacky happens when the resulting Array of AnnotationLines is given to the diffing engine.
