@fxbing it is a nice motivation. but I am feeling that you didn't change the code in the right place. the change in fetchPartitionedTopicMetadataAsync will introduce unnecessary creation of partitioned topic. The `auto-creation` happens when a producer or a consumer connects to broker. so I think the change should be done in `BrokerService`. You can check the methods `getOrCreateTopic`.\r\n\r\nI first thought about making changes in the BrokerService, but when the client requests to create a Producer or Consumer, it will first get partitions info from zk, decide whether to create partitioned or non-partitioned. When the request arrives at the BrokerService, the client has decided to create a nonpartitioned Producer or Consumer. If the Broker's configuration requires automatic creation of a partitioned topic, Broker needs to send the configuration information to client, client re-establishes the partitioned Producer or Consumer, and the BrokerService updates the partitions in the zk.\r\n\r\nI think it's easier to make changes when the client creates the type that determines the creation, and need fewer communications.\r\n\r\nDo I need to modify it as I said above?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/521877181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/521877466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4963#issuecomment-521877466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4963","id":521877466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTg3NzQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"fxbing","id":29175509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTc1NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29175509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing","html_url":"https://github.com/fxbing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxbing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T04:13:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T04:13:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Also change \"partition\" and \"non-partition\" to \"partitioned\" and \"non-partitioned\".
