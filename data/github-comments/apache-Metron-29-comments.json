was able to get this to work by performing one extra step.  The PR description did not include the Kafka ACL command to permission the topic, only the \"pycapa\" group.  After I did this, I was able to verify data with the pycapa --consumer command.  The topic ACL command is included in the Pycapa README so I think simply adding the ACL command for the group is all that's needed.\r\n\r\nI did notice that running the pycapa --producer command causes a Kafka service ticket to be cached.  Since we're passing in the metron principal and keytab I would expect that ticket to be in the cache instead.  While it's unexpected it did not cause any errors.\r\n\r\nOne last minor documentation issue:  this PR description includes steps to install Python 2.7 but nowhere is that mentioned in the README.

In that case, we should probably just remove it entirely and leave it by sensor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298377727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298378724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/556#issuecomment-298378724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/556","id":298378724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODM3ODcyNA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T17:20:04Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T17:20:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Worked as advertised.  +1 from me assuming we work out the UNION ALL vs UNION requirement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298378724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298379161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/556#issuecomment-298379161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/556","id":298379161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODM3OTE2MQ==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T17:22:00Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T17:22:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"tl;dr - I'm +1 with the combined report, just wanted to understand the trade space.\r\n\r\nYou have it right.

The YAF portion is correct.  The YAF sensor produces flow information from A to B and you produce a table that counts and orders them.  Bro is almost correct.  Bro produces HTTP and DNS metadata for us.  So you need to differentiate by protocol.  In case of Bro-DNS your dashboard should say top DNS requests.  In case of Bro-HTTP your dashboard should say top HTTP requests.  Snort is an IDS that produces alerts.  So your dashboard should say top number of generated alerts.  \r\n\r\nOne thing that would be useful here is to add a second dashboard for YAF that would give me a  histogram for a connection of my choice.  For example, your top connection is 192.168.66.1->192.168.66.121 | 867.  If I could have a second follow-up dashboard where i could have 4 boxes: sourceIP, destIP, TimeBinSize, HowFarToReachBack.  An example use would be that I would take the top connection and do the following: SourceIP= 192.168.66.1, DestIP=192.168.66.121, TimeBinSize=5 mins, HowFarToReachBack=3hours.  Then it draws a histogram of the top connection for me in 5 min increments reaching back 3 hours.

Really great work so far.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of requests.  First there are some very minor style issues.  Several lines are not terminated so that should be cleaned up.  \r\n\r\nI feel like the organization of the \"Sensor Config for parser e2e1\" is too broad.  I would prefer tests to be broken down a little bit more, by feature or editor pane if possible.  For example, as a test I swapped the sort orders in threat triage editor.  The tests failed (yay!) but the test description reported in the failure was \"Sensor Config for parser e2e1 should add e2e parser\".  That is too vague and gives me no indication of where the error happened and what part of the code I need to inspect. \r\n\r\nI think there may also be some gaps in testing.  Is the raw JSON editor tested?  Advanced config?  Are we testing how we format field names and values in the read-only and list view?  When we're editing sensors are we verifying the correct config is saved?  Are we verifying the editor looks correct when we open an existing sensor (not just the primary form but child panes as well)?  Are we testing the general settings page?\r\n\r\nAnother concern I have is that we're expecting a static list of sensors.  These tests will break if a sensor is ever added to Metron and it won't be obvious because these tests are not part of the build workflow.  Is it possible/reasonable to add some kind of setup script to create the test cases so that they will not be affected by new parsers being added?\r\n\r\nStill more work to do but this is a solid start.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298453600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298458837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/556#issuecomment-298458837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/556","id":298458837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ1ODgzNw==","user":{"login":"james-sirota","id":4854764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTQ3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4854764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota","html_url":"https://github.com/james-sirota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-01T23:25:07Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T23:26:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry wrong window on the comment before...

There may be a better/simpler way that I am not aware of.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/298978399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/299087566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/561#issuecomment-299087566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/561","id":299087566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTA4NzU2Ng==","user":{"login":"james-sirota","id":4854764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTQ3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4854764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota","html_url":"https://github.com/james-sirota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-04T03:04:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-04T03:04:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+ 1 looks great","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/299087566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/299087789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/556#issuecomment-299087789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/556","id":299087789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTA4Nzc4OQ==","user":{"login":"james-sirota","id":4854764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTQ3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4854764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota","html_url":"https://github.com/james-sirota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-sirota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-04T03:07:48Z","updated_at":"2017-05-04T03:07:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for fixing the cumulative report.
