The issue is pretty random. To more or less reliably get at least 2 or more missing copy/paste in the notepad win, I had to raise the maxtries to about 50. This extends the duration of each test run. But at least with a native NbClipboard.java from Tag 22 this way I can reliably reproduce two or more copy/paste errors per run.\r\n\r\nBut now the funny thing is coming. I've filled up the NbClipboard.java with several System.out.println(...). More or less half of the methods had one directly on entry, so was the first line in each affected method. Wasn't in all of the methods, but around every second one. Because I don't know where to look closer I've done some random choosing of some methods. I've changed nothing else in the source code, just added these println(). But this version now runs through the test without any loss of any copy&paste cycle. I've done three tests with 50 tries each. During that span the normal NbClipboard.java would have had at least 6 or more losses.\r\n\r\nSo my guess is, that this issue (or to be more precise: the issue which will be shown by the test case) is some timing/sync/context change problem. Unfortunately I'm not able to tell you, which method should be slowed down or be \"interrupted\" by a println() to show this effect. This would need some more of these long running tests, and currently I'm out of time, at least for the rest of this week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2376831718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2376958168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6630#issuecomment-2376958168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6630","id":2376958168,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6NrYDY","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-26T13:20:33Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T13:20:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"well late :D will need rebase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2376958168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2376983746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-2376983746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":2376983746,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6NreTC","user":{"login":"greggwon","id":3497254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTcyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3497254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon","html_url":"https://github.com/greggwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greggwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-26T13:29:57Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T13:29:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This feels like a data race or cache sync problem.

 I don't think the alignment problems in older LAFs are due to this patch;\r\n\r\nyes, this is not what I meant. This dialog is somewhat special since it uses the old grid bag layout which doesn't implement text baseline alignment for neighboring components if i remember correctly. Two combo boxes are also multi line fields with dynamic height - so this is to be expected that it won't look nice on all LAFs. (I remember starring at the dialog a while while doing https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3393)\r\n\r\nWhat i meant was that the GTK laf specifically looks inconsistent everywhere else too. Toolbar icons have the wrong size and every combo box looks different. I set `-J-Djdk.gtk.version=2` for VisualVM to make it somewhat useable (fixes the toolbars at least).\r\n\r\nI am wondering if we should filter it out from the LAF list? I guess users could still use the flag to force

I do remember that before (~6 years ago when I last used deployment to remote domain) it was not making any difference if remote and local versions were bit different (as my test on NB 11.3 showns), thus I didn't pay much attention to it.\r\nIn case it is a requirement now to have the same versions of payara on local and remote machines - I am fine with that and absolutely okay to have this issue closed.\r\nFrom the other side if, at least, some warnings about local vs. remote versions mismatch could be added in scope of this issue - it would be beneficial for other users of NB who potentially could get in the same situation.\r\nThus it is up to you how to proceed with this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you once again!
