You should basically read javadocs of 4 added classes and interfaces. I don't see a point in copy-pasting Javadoc here.\r\n\r\n> can you list down all the future changes that are needed to make this PR useful and get some good results ?\r\n\r\nThere is ObjectStrategy refactoring, see the first message in this thread:\r\n> I. e. it's makes index merging with rollup 3% slower. This is because this PR starts to become really beneficial when garbage-free object metric ser/de is implemented, as mentioned here: #5172, and I wanted to do that before publishing this PR, but it turned out to be a pandora box and it may take several months to complete that work. So I decided to publish this PR even though it doesn't improve performance yet, because this work is already done and i don't want to re-do it when master diverges.\r\n\r\nSome more info: https://github.com/DataSketches/memory/issues/14#issuecomment-353591816. It's already 70% done (for several months already), it awaits for this PR and also for some changes in DataSketches/memory. It will allow to drastically reduce amount of garbage produced when Object columns are involved into index merging (like histogram, dataSketches).\r\n\r\n> Finally, is this code tested somewhere in production ? If not, can we get branch tested in some test cluster to gain some more confidence here.\r\n\r\nNo, it's not used in production. I'm not going to test this change in production before it's part of a release, because we moved away from this practice.

My feeling is that the justification given in #1362 for the current logic is not worth the unintuitive behavior in the case where a segment starts before the load interval but also extends into it.

thank you for the report! I'm making a patch for this bug.\r\n\r\nDruid stores metadata for each segment. The metadata contains some meta information of a segment like timestamp spec, query granularity, a flag to indicate the segment is rolled up, and so on. This information is stored in a separate `meta.smoosh` file when a segment is stored. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that most fields of metadata can be `null`. `null` in metadata means that Druid can't determine that information. For example, let me suppose we have two segments to merge into a single segment. If one of them was rolled up (`isRollup` = true) but another wasn't (`isRollup` = false), `isRollup` is set to `null` for the new merged segment because we can't decide it. \r\n\r\n`compactionTask` uses metadata to get the information about aggregators and `isRollup` of input segments. So, you can avoid this issue by using `indexTask` instead of `compactionTask` which requires to specify the whole dataSchema in the task spec.\r\n\r\n> - Should the task exit with SUCCESS or FAILED if it cannot figure out how to compact the segments?\r\n> - How will the auto compacter handle this?\r\n\r\n@gianm good point. I think the task complete state should be FAILED to let users know the compaction failed. \r\n\r\nThis kind of bug will make the compactor to try to compact the same interval forever. Currently, since this will occupy only one task slot, remaining intervals will be compacted if users have enough task slots for compaction. However, we need something to handle this kind of infinite compaction failures in a nicer way. Maintaining a blacklist for failed intervals might be a solution. Users can reset the blacklist once they fix their problems.

I think it was for avoiding code duplication, but it can be improved by splitting them and extracting common code paths into utility methods.\r\n\r\nThe process method isn't doing any additional merges. The only change is to make it cognizant of the fact that the sub-query sequence it is processing in case of forcePushDown is now a result of running the pushed down nested query instead. \r\n\r\n>A groupBy v2 query requires to get a resource before query execution. We currently check there are enough number of merge buffers to execute a given query. Since historicals have processed only the inner-most query so far, they have always required a single merge buffer. However, they can process nested queries after this patch, resource preservation should be changed as well. Please see here for how the number of merge buffers is calculated for brokers.\r\n\r\nGood point. I will make sure that historicals have same number of merge buffers as broker. Although from the first look at the code, it seems like it it should, but I will make sure and hopefully add a test for the same too.\r\n\r\n >If I understand correctly, once forceNestedQueryPushDown is set to true, the inner most query is passed from GroupByQueryQueryToolChest to DirectDruidClient to find which historicals should receive the query, and then that the pushed down nested query is sent from DirectDruidClient. I think this kind of value hijacking can cause many potential bugs. Instead, I suggest to add an interface to Query to find the dataSource of the inner-most query.\r\n\r\nThanks.

I am not the biggest fan of the approach I took, either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/380569660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/380571602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5597#issuecomment-380571602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5597","id":380571602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDU3MTYwMg==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T19:39:16Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T19:39:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the contribution, can you please sign the CLA?\r\n\r\nhttp://druid.io/community/cla.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/380571602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/380571931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5471#issuecomment-380571931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5471","id":380571931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDU3MTkzMQ==","user":{"login":"samarthjain","id":1642180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain","html_url":"https://github.com/samarthjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-11T19:40:32Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T19:40:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">The integration test fails in my laptop as well.
