of subsequent discussion with @mbehrendt on this topic:\n1. anonymous rule does not necessarily mean unnamed - the system may generate a name for the rule; by making the rule implicitly named, the trigger-action mapping should be unique (unless explicitly named).\n2. rather than introduce two ways of creating rules (one via `wsk rule create` and another via `wsk trigger associate`) there will be only one way to create a rule (named or unnamed) and it will be via `wsk rule create` (with optional rule name); this avoids introducing new terminology and non-orthogonal mechanisms for doing the same thing.\n3. to save a step for the user, creating a rule will enable it by default (similarly deleting a rule [that is not named] should disable it by default).\n4. we may be able to implement these implicitly named rules via the CLI (or UI) - entirely on the client initially with light additive changes to the rules API (rules list should provide trigger/action details and possibly allow

this particular capability addressed by this issue, the Go command line package behaves a bit differently than the Python command line parser.  In particular, when a command line argument (i.e. `--apihost`) is defined against the root command and sub-commands, the sub-command definition \"wins\".\n\nThe Go `wsk` command defines `--apihost`, `--auth` and `--apiversion` flags that each take a string argument; the Go `wsk property get` command defines the same flags; however, these flags are boolean switches and do not take string arguments.  When the command arguments are merged, it appears that the final command's definition (`get` in this scenario) will override any previous argument definitions having the same name.\n\nConsequently, as this issue describes, the Go CLI behavior will differ from the Python CLI for this scenario.  While a bit contrived, here's a silly example that shows the described behavior.\n\n```\n>wsk property get --apihost\nwhisk API host           openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net\n>wsk --apihost openwhisk.stage1.ng.bluemix.net property get --apihost\nwhisk API host           openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net\n```\n\nOne solution may be to have two commands - one command that manages CLI configuration and another command that obtains whisk server settings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/234981580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/234983193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/918#issuecomment-234983193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/918","id":234983193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDk4MzE5Mw==","user":{"login":"psuter","id":245547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter","html_url":"https://github.com/psuter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psuter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T15:13:11Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T15:13:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged as 8812ced660f568c79ca8511cbae63eadcbb19f95.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/234983193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/234983364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/906#issuecomment-234983364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/906","id":234983364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDk4MzM2NA==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T15:13:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T15:13:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll take a look at this PR and try to merge it.

The CLI can be configured with a default namespace `wsk property set --namespace NAME`; all subsequent CLI commands will default to that namespace.  Use `wsk property get --namespace` to see your current default namespace configuration.  If you want to access another namespace while retaining the default namespace configuration, the target entity must include the target namespace (i.e. `/whisk.system/weather` is the qualified name of the weather package).\n\nEntities in have access control protection via --auth key and the entity's public(shared)/private setting.  So even though you know the namespace, you might not have access to a particular entity in that namespace.  Currently, this access control implementation has issues per the following conversation I had with @rabbah.\n\n```\nMark Deuser [8:17 AM]  \nah.. `wsk package list /whisk.system` does work\nare the /whisk.system entities shared?\nmaybe that's where i'm confused.. does a `public` entity give read rights (i.e. list, copy) ?\npackages, actions, triggers, and rules can all be created as `public`\n\nRodric Rabbah [8:24 AM]  \nYeah that's misleading we have defects to address\nOnly carries meaning on a package today\n```\n\nSo, at the moment, the public/private setting is only applicable to packages right now; this means that even though a non-package entity in another namespace may be configured as `public (shared)`, it won't be directly accessible via the CLI.  To have that access to that entity, you will need to supply the namespace's auth key.\n\n@rabbah - Feel free to confirm and/or correct.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/235026981/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/235027986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/661#issuecomment-235027986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/661","id":235027986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTAyNzk4Ng==","user":{"login":"ioana-blue","id":17202292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjAyMjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17202292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-blue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-blue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T17:46:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T17:46:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As far as I understand, there is no test in place for this, correct?
