About partition pruning . it will skip unneeded data for example:\r\n        there are follow partitions: \r\n        /hudi_ws/order/dt=20200801\r\n        /hudi_ws/order/dt=20200802\r\n             ... ...\r\n        /hudi_ws/order/dt=20200831\r\n      Query sql like \" `select * from order where dt>'20200820'` \". it will start 31 tasks and 20 tasks which partition are in  \r\n      {20200801,...,20200820} are not need running . if  we support partition pruning (current implement in spark 1. built-in \r\n      FileSourceStrategy 2. spark v3 datasource v2  [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30428] \r\n     (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30428) ). it will skip unneeded partition data \r\n     and only running 11 tasks which partition are in  {20200821,...,20200831}. it will make more effective\r\n    \r\n   2. About 'CatalystScan other than PrunedFilteredScan'\r\n       This is just for the convenience of using `listFiles` method partitionFilters parameter\r\n     `PartitioningAwareFileIndex#listFiles(partitionFilters: Seq[Expression], dataFilters: Seq[Expression])`\r\n      CatalystScan was marked 'Experimental' as you mentioned \r\n      CatalystScan and PrunedFilteredScan built thought DataSourceStrategy. I investigated it. it didn't have any special logic. \r\n       They just passed different parameters. and there is usecase (`https://github.com/Huawei-Spark/Spark-SQL-on- \r\n       HBase/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hbase/HBaseRelation.scala`)\r\n      I'm also troubled with ( 1. FileSourceStrategy did partitionKeyFilters but no in DataSourceStrategy 2. using CatalystScan \r\n      or PrunedFilteredScan 3. split allPredicates to partitionfilter and datafilter) when I implement this function. and do you \r\n      have any suggestions on the ' support partition pruning'\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/751559719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/751568479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2366#issuecomment-751568479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2366","id":751568479,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTU2ODQ3OQ==","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-28T04:16:40Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T04:16:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
