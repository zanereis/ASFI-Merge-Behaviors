But I also see that the `self.command is not None` part is redundant as well in the newly suggested implemented `self.command is not None and isinstance(self.command, str) and self.command.strip().find('[') == 0`, so I am finally changing this to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_command(self):\r\n        if isinstance(self.command, str) and self.command.strip().find('[') == 0:\r\n            commands = ast.literal_eval(self.command)\r\n        else:\r\n            commands = self.command\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease have a look and let me know if you see any concerns. Thanks for the review. :) ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/504724943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/504726758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5459#issuecomment-504726758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5459","id":504726758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDcyNjc1OA==","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-23T07:16:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-23T07:16:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I thought Python type hints and types in docstrings were 2 different things?
