I've solved this using a similar solution to yours but instead of creating a custom chart, I update each bar's layout properties.

For each series, we loop through the data and get the bar layout.\r\n2. For each of the bars, we define the label text. In my case, it's a combination of series name and value.\r\n3. We then grab the itemLabelModel. This is the object with label options. I wanted to show/hide labels for each bars as opposed to doing it at the series level.\r\n4. We merge seriesLabel options into itemLabel options just in case you have defined some of the config at the series level.\r\n5. We obtain text rectangle for each label (the bounding box of the text)\r\n6. Finally, we compare it against the bar layout. When rotated 90 degress, you want to compare the label height with the bar width and the label width with the bar height.\r\n\r\nIn the demo, I'm showing the labels on hover so that you can see them overflow the bars.\r\nPlease resize the window in the sandbox so that you can see lables show/hide","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/517322955/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/517386464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10944#issuecomment-517386464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10944","id":517386464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzM4NjQ2NA==","user":{"login":"missionz3r0","id":3701326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDEzMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3701326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0","html_url":"https://github.com/missionz3r0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/missionz3r0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T17:36:30Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T17:36:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see what you're saying, but that splits from the API for [links](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series-graph.links) then. \r\n\r\nThe API tells us that it uses the name, but in the case that you are using numbers for your name and edges it checks for the index?
