to provide some more explanation. Certain computations such as\ncount distinct are fundamentally slow operations and no brilliant\narchitecture can overcome limitations in physics. For this reason, people\nhave started developing approximate sketch algorithms that can greatly\nimprove performance and reduce storage. Using an approximate cardinality\nalgorithm can dramatically reduce the amount of data you have to store and\nimprove operations over this data by orders of magnitude. The question for\nyour design is, do you want to store potentially 100x more data and have\nqueries run 100x slower for 100% accuracy? If so, you can look into\nNishant's suggestion, and also take a look at lexicographic topNs, which\ncan paginate through the values of a dimension and you can count the number\nof values present.\n\nOn Wed, Oct 14, 2015 at 7:43 AM, Charles Allen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I also have filed #1826 https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/1826\n> to make sure the expected behavior is better spelled out in the docs.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/1825#issuecomment-148071951.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/148129205/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/148139943","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1813#issuecomment-148139943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1813","id":148139943,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODEzOTk0Mw==","user":{"login":"mark1900","id":11822480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIyNDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11822480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900","html_url":"https://github.com/mark1900","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mark1900/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-14T18:07:27Z","updated_at":"2015-10-14T18:07:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Quick question to @himanshug .

have had avro working for a while, but code is not generic enough and very specific to our schemas. In fact, it will not be possible to take a general avro schema and convert it to druid row because avro has support for very many complex types, so we will have to compromise anyway. Also, it was written pre druid-0.8.0 era where it wasn't possible to have InputFormats that could return anything but Text records.\nWith druid-0.8.2, the limitation regarding Text records is gone. In my org, some people are working on next gen druid avro integration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/150103531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/150129595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1844#issuecomment-150129595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1844","id":150129595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDEyOTU5NQ==","user":{"login":"zhaown","id":3255910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTU5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3255910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T07:20:34Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T07:20:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm using avro with druid for production, for batch indexing, it's not complicated based on @himanshug 's https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/1472, and I'm using my `AvroValueInputFormat` which is the mirror of `AvroKeyInputFormat`.\n\nBut for realtime indexing, it's a bit more cumbersome because you need an schema to deserialize avro object from binary stream, and you don't want to send schema with every serialized record to kafka. Then you need an schema registry, currently we are using [schemarepo](https://github.com/schema-repo/schema-repo) and `camus schema registry client`, the latter is not in the maven central... \n\nI'll
