The spark shell. (`./bin/spark-shell`)\n2. The examples. (`./bin/run-example`)\n\nI think these classes should probably be moved to examples, right? @mateiz what do you think?\n\nI recently refactored (1) to internally use the spark submit script by passing a special name for the jar (`spark-internal`). I'd also like to have user submit the examples jar to spark-submit when running examples as discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1565.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41484532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41484541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/565#issuecomment-41484541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/565","id":41484541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDg0NTQx","user":{"login":"WangTaoTheTonic","id":5276001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzYwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5276001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic","html_url":"https://github.com/WangTaoTheTonic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WangTaoTheTonic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-26T23:58:53Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T23:58:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for that, i already fixed it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41484541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41484924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/567#issuecomment-41484924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/567","id":41484924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDg0OTI0","user":{"login":"scwf","id":7018048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7018048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf","html_url":"https://github.com/scwf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-27T00:27:05Z","updated_at":"2014-04-27T00:27:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The test may has some problems.
