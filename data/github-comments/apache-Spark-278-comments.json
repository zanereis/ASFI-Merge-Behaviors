This seems to be the motivation for `provided` scope, since it achieves this as a secondary effect. But in the exceptional case where Spark is being used outside an environment where Spark is provided, this has the undesirable primary effect of making Spark not execute for lack of Guava, unless the packager also includes Guava for it. Either way can be made to work and are equivalent for the common case, where Spark is `provided`.\n\nEDIT: OK, is this accurate?\n\nA \"compile\" scope Guava is the simple thing to do, and allows the shading solution to proceed. It however causes Guava to leak into apps that depend on Spark. But, only if they don't do the normal thing and treat Spark as \"provided\".\n\nA \"provided\" scope Guava is more unusual, and requires some extra work in POM, but also enables the shading solution. Guava doesn't leak at all, but, people not depending on Spark as \"provided\" must remember to depend on Guava for Spark.\n\nA \"compile\" scope Guava that is also \"optional\" works with the shading solution (? I think). Guava doesn't leak. But people using not using Spark as \"provided\" still have to remember to include Guava for Spark.\n\nThe last two seem the same, so, I suppose I can't really argue for \"compile+optional\" and against \"provided\" since the semantics are the same and both are not precisely what we desire (which would be something like \"runtime by default for transitive dependers\").\n\nProceed unless anyone else has an opinion to the contrary, IMHO.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51414756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51414885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1758#issuecomment-51414885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1758","id":51414885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDE0ODg1","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T00:11:20Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T00:11:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1758:<br>\\- This patch FAILED unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/18075/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51414885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51415792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1813#issuecomment-51415792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1813","id":51415792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDE1Nzky","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T00:24:12Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T00:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pwendell I think you may have suggested in jira at some point to create a separate deliverable for the shaded guava jar, and have the spark build depend on that.

For instance, users who write applications that embed spark, they don't have to try to recreate or mimic our distribution artifacts. For this reason I have a slight bias for the existing approach, just because we've used it for a long time without any issues.\n\nThe way we do this type of shading has been ad-hoc, we've typically cloned the relevant projects, re-written class names and then published them to maven central under the org.spark-project namespace.\n\nOn the dev list I recently explained to @avati that it would be nice to include scripts in the Spark repo that do this. He's actually starting working on this and you can see an example for protobuf - I think the stuff he's done so far looks great:\n\nhttps://github.com/avati/spark-shaded/blob/master/0001-protobuf.sh\n\nI downloaded guava the other day and played around, I think it will be pretty straightforward to do this for guava as well.\n\nI actually know several other projects that have started to use our shaded artifacts (we tend to shade dependencies that are a common pain point) - so I think there is some value in continuing to do this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51423938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51423993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1513#issuecomment-51423993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1513","id":51423993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDIzOTkz","user":{"login":"scwf","id":7018048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7018048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf","html_url":"https://github.com/scwf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T02:35:59Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T02:35:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pwendell
