These days I've been reading through the source code of the key generator and registry center related. I'd like to discuss with you at the plan of coding leaf generator.  \r\n1. As you know the leaf generator needs zookeeper client to communicate with zookeeper server. So the way of initializing the zookeeper client is a little hard to decide. Although, initializing the client and the definition of the client has been implemented in 'package org.apache.shardingsphere.orchestration.reg'. But it is hard to use them directly,.Beacuse the key generator is in 'package org.apache.shardingsphere.core.strategy.keygen'. So I'm planning to write these part on my own to initialize the client and the related functions. \r\n2. The property of the leaf segment generator, especially zookeeper client related.I'd like to use new parameter，this means orchestration register related parameter won't be used.\r\nThese two points are what I like to discuss with you, do you have any suggestion?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/492579588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/492608354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2319#issuecomment-492608354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/2319","id":492608354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjYwODM1NA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-15T11:01:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T11:02:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,
