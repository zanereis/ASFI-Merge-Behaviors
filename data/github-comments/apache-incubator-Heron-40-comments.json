The result of scale up (which is homogeneous containers) will be undone with both your and my algorithm since they both remove the homogeneous containers (yours because of the imbalance metric and mine because of categorization). In this scenario both algos will produce the old state (state before scale upoperation). The problem comes when you operate on mixed containers. If your goal is for mixed containers to remove imbalance then that's ok, but if your goal is to remove as much containers as possible during scale down then imbalance metric will not do that. IMO the latter provides better user experience than the former because users ultimately scale down to release resources.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/263979137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/263982334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1560#issuecomment-263982334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1560","id":263982334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mzk4MjMzNA==","user":{"login":"avflor","id":18666312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18666312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor","html_url":"https://github.com/avflor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avflor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-30T20:14:21Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T20:14:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The example you give me is a use case where your heuristic will remove a container and my will not. However, note that these are heuristics. There are cases that these will not work. The observation here is that optimizing for removing imbalance doesn't necessarily mean that you remove containers. In fact it can prevent container removal.  If you want to optimize for removing containers then a heuristic that removes from the least loaded container will result in the general case  in more removals that a heuristic that optimizes for imbalance.

It seems that we mixed different objectives, say load balance and minimization of # of containers, together. \r\n\r\nIMO, if we consider the problem we discuss as a Bin Packing problem, minimization of the # of containers used implicitly covers the load balance objective. Because you can remove more containers, only if the containers are well balanced. The difference is that in our scenario there is already a packing plan, so we also want to minimize the instance movement cost (Removing an instance has no cost, but moving an instance does) when doing the bin packing. By proposing a algorithm to solve the bin packing problem with the consideration on minimization the instance movement overhead, we can achieve both load balance, container removal and operator scaling-up/down, simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/264064195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/264071830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/645#issuecomment-264071830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/645","id":264071830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDA3MTgzMA==","user":{"login":"khurrumnasimm","id":21236134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjM2MTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21236134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm","html_url":"https://github.com/khurrumnasimm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khurrumnasimm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-01T03:50:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T03:50:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is there anyone active working on this?
