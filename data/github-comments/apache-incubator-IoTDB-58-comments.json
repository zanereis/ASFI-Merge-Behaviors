Do you have any test result?\r\n\r\nI tested it with benchmark and found that the registration timing was so slow that I killed the test. This can estimate the speed drop. When it is 0, it takes about 10ms to access the disk each time a sequence is created, and it is estimated that about 100 sequences are created per second. When it is 100, a time series is 300 bytes, 1MB cache can carry about 3000 times, and the cache is flushed 10 times per second, and about 30,000 time series can be created. There are two orders of magnitude difference in speed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1042700428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/1042702509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/5073#issuecomment-1042702509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/5073","id":1042702509,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCXnElM4-JmCt","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-17T08:42:59Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T08:42:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
