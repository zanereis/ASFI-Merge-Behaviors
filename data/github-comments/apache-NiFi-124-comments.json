I realize, as I reviewed again, that my comments may have come off in a bit of a \"This has to change, this has to change, this has to change!\" tone. My apologies, if that's the case. I just started a review and commented on things that I noticed as I read through, a bit of a stream of thoughts. This resulted in some comments being rather nit-picky, was just mentioning anything that stuck out to me.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks @turcsanyip for reviewing as well! And for explaining how you tested. My biggest concern was that I didn't have a good way to easily test this, which is why I was suggesting the integration test. I do think that an integration test for this would be ideal and would be helpful to avoid breaking things going forward. However, I realize that providing an integration test is a tall order, and it's not something that necessarily has to be done before merging this PR - as long as we have a clear way of testing this.

that!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/557585203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/557660624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3894#issuecomment-557660624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3894","id":557660624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzY2MDYyNA==","user":{"login":"tpalfy","id":53442425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQyNDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53442425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy","html_url":"https://github.com/tpalfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpalfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T19:23:07Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T19:23:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No

The reason is: most of the time we're using the combination of ListAzureBlobStorage with FetchAzureBlobStorage and the List processor is creating flow files with this flow file attribute to be used in the Fetch processor (https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-azure-bundle/nifi-azure-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/azure/storage/ListAzureBlobStorage.java#L72).
