If per cursor-znode (with ack-holes) it increases 80 bytes to 150KB then we may not want to store 10K range to avoid higher footprint size.\r\n\r\nHere, with storing 10 range in binary format increases size from 80 bytes to 150 bytes which kind of keeps footprint stable. But then it will not solve the problem which discussed in this issue where large ack-holes can create backlog. So, I think having option to restrict distance between markDelete and readPosition is something useful for broker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/327642650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/327644681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/742#issuecomment-327644681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/742","id":327644681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzY0NDY4MQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-07T00:02:42Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T00:02:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">  where large ack-holes can create backlog \r\n\r\nlarge *number* of ack-holes\r\n\r\n> So, I think having option to restrict distance between markDelete and readPosition is something useful for broker.\r\n\r\nIt's not related at all with the distance.

\r\n\r\n>  What did you feel unclear about the name?\r\nPlease tell me if there is an idea or suggestion.\r\n\r\nI can understand the name because we have been talking about it but I'm not confident with that plugin developers easily understand what it is for. The name you suggested doesn't add any context (the same thing is already written as the method name and the parameter name). As I wrote on the issue, I'd suggest `EncodedAuthenticationParameterSupport`. I'm also fine with `Pulsar2AuthenticationInterface` if we agreed on marking the old one deprecated.\r\n\r\n> Does the old interface need to be deprecated?\r\nWhen deleting the old interface, it is inconvenient because we have to give all settings as a string.\r\n\r\nYes, I think it need to be deprecated because it makes API simple and solid, and it indicates that we are not going to add support for other formats on `configure`. As I wrote above, plugin developers can parse the string with just one line if we provide an utility class.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd not write configuration values directly in `authParams` if I wrote a plugin which requires many and/or complex configurations. I'd write just an external filename or an URL instead. Even if the format was JSON, one line JSON is hard to read / write.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/328077137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/328172453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/747#issuecomment-328172453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/747","id":328172453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODE3MjQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"jai1","id":8659452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8659452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1","html_url":"https://github.com/jai1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jai1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T17:56:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T17:56:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"retest

Acks are currently fire and forget, the do check that the message got written to socket, which is more that what redeliveries check right now, but could be prone to errors.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that if you get disconnected, the messages will be redelivered again after reconnection. \r\n\r\nDepending on the subscription type, so if you are consuming on a shared subscription, and one ack gets lost because of a disconnection, the broker will dispatch all messages that were sent to consumer C1 and not acked (from broker perspective) to another available consumer. \r\n\r\nThat will lead to duplicates, though not message loss. \r\n\r\n> Should we maybe handle an ackTimeout on broker side?\r\n\r\nThe reason for doing in it in client side is that broker is already re-delelivering all unacked messages when it detects that the consumer got disconnected. \r\n\r\nThis is based on the TCP connection. There's also a \"probe\" that checks for the connection not to be stalled/partitioned. It sends a *ping* every 30s if there's no activity on the connection and it will forcefully close the connection if there's no response.\r\n\r\n>Should redelivery messages have a reply and only then would consumer stop tracking those messages?\r\n> Should acks also have a reply?\r\n\r\nHaving acks-on-the-acks doesn't help a lot if you're considering that: \r\n * With a receive / acknowledge model the guarantee will only be *at-least-once*\r\n * Even if waiting for the ack-reply, that could be timed-out. At that point you don't\r\n    know whether your ack was recorded or not. Worst case it wasn't, and the message will be re-delivered.\r\n * It's anyway very tricky to decide what to do when an acknowledgment fails to be recorded. In most of cases, the best option is just to have the message re-delivered.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/328924354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/328930818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/750#issuecomment-328930818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/750","id":328930818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODkzMDgxOA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-12T17:49:39Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T17:49:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Change looks good.
