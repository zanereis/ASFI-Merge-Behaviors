some modification to #7059 (see #7093), I was able to achieve a test ppl of 73.03 with hidden size of 650 and 71.74 with hidden size of 1500, with tied weights and variational drop of 0.5 on outputs and 0.5 on states. Compared to 75.96 and 72.30 in pytorch with the same setting with regular dropout.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/315925730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/315925822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2535#issuecomment-315925822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2535","id":315925822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTkyNTgyMg==","user":{"login":"lichen11","id":6911428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTE0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6911428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11","html_url":"https://github.com/lichen11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lichen11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T00:48:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T00:48:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried your code above. \r\nglobal_pooling_feature <- predict(model, X = normed) actually gives the probability vector, as it sums up to one.\r\nI tried using predict(model2, X = normed) and got an error.

guys @piiswrong @mli @tqchen , can anyone have a review on this? This is an update of the pull request #6304 which adds an early stopping class for the training module. This class is capable of stopping the training early by either non-improving training errors or eval errors (if eval data is given). Users can customise the paticen to decide how many rounds of non-improvement can be tolerated. While early stopping happens, models will be saved by enabling the option. \r\n\r\nThis is an extention to the current callback apis which can be used very similar to the Speedometer class so that new users should find it very easy.\r\n\r\nThank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/316067513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/316068217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7064#issuecomment-316068217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7064","id":316068217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjA2ODIxNw==","user":{"login":"qingzhouzhen","id":14066190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDY2MTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14066190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen","html_url":"https://github.com/qingzhouzhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingzhouzhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-18T13:45:20Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T13:45:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
