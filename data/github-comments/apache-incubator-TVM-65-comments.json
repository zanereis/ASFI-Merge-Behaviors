thanks for review.\r\n\r\n> Is this additional level of redirection necessary in the tvm_trace_runtime? Currently, the feature being implemented seems to be fine to just call call_packed.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understood, to be able to handle packed function, and take action only on those functions which are registered in global registry, we need an additional runtime machinery, in my case I've added global function \"tvm.trace_runtime\" which checks the global registry for the registered trace callbacks and calls it if necessary. In other case if we use call_packed inside computation node and the packed function is not registered we will get an error.\r\nSo, if we use only call_packed without wrapping, we should explicitly pass the name of runtime handler as first arg\r\n`call_packed (\"tvm.trace_runtime\", \"tvm_global_callback\", expr)`\r\ninstead\r\n`tvm.trace(\"tvm_global_callback\", expr)`\r\nCan you please clarify, what do you think, should I delete those wrapping ?\r\n\r\n> One of the properties of trace is that we might want to return the same specific value x[i] when we trace the content, which might need some additional work in the compiler when seeing trace, this property seems not being reflected here.\r\n\r\nThanks for mention this, I completely forget about return value. Before updating the patch, I want make sure, that I get your right about \"work in the compiler\".\r\nSeems to me, I just can add return value to TVMRetValue\r\n`*ret = args[1];`\r\nand this requires some cosmetic changes in code which lowers tvm_call_packed\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/pass/lower_tvm_builtin.cc#L254\r\nFrom:\r\n```\r\nreturn Call::make(\r\n        Int(32), intrinsic::tvm_call_packed_lowered,\r\n        packed_args, Call::Intrinsic);\r\n```\r\nTo:\r\n```\r\nreturn Call::make(\r\n        op->type, intrinsic::tvm_call_packed_lowered,\r\n        packed_args, Call::Intrinsic);\r\n\r\n```\r\nand to the call_packed python wrapper to create a Call node with the actual type of processed Expr.\r\nCan you please confirm it, or there are could be some problems which I don't see, because a lot of logic depends on packed functions.\r\ncc @grwlf \r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/447335309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/447389702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1601#issuecomment-447389702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1601","id":447389702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzM4OTcwMg==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T17:10:41Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T17:34:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen @nhynes Frontend is finally [here](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2292).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/447389702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/447396157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2291#issuecomment-447396157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2291","id":447396157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzM5NjE1Nw==","user":{"login":"ehsanmok","id":6980212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODAyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6980212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok","html_url":"https://github.com/ehsanmok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehsanmok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T17:33:51Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T17:34:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Very strange!
