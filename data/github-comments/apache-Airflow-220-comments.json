When I say building as a plugin, there's nothing contrary to AIP-5. AIP-5 could be in the core, and be built on top of this. The intention would be that any DAG loading method used in the core would use the same hooks as the plugins.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy here is to use the same code to extend core functionality as used to extend plugin functionality to provide everyone with good solid hooks for performing extensions to Airflow without having to do PR's on the core.\r\n\r\nBut just to confirm, there is nothing contradictory with AIP-5 and this PR. AIP-5 could use the hooks in this PR and still be distributed with the core airflow.\r\n\r\nSide note: Using plugin hooks, means you can have pieces of code which exist in seperate repositories and users can install at their will and if there is a desire within the core community, those repositories can be brought into airflow core through normal PR process. But it reduces the need for actual PR's into the core on whether code is suitable to go in the airflow core.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485102939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485105277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5085#issuecomment-485105277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5085","id":485105277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTEwNTI3Nw==","user":{"login":"drewsonne","id":233054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne","html_url":"https://github.com/drewsonne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewsonne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T12:07:54Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T12:10:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Shooting from the hip, but to implement AIP-5, would be something like this on top of these hooks\r\n\r\n```import json\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import LoggingMixin\r\nfrom airflow.configuration import conf\r\nfrom airflow.plugin import AirflowPluginDagSource\r\nfrom airflow.plugins_manager import AirflowPlugin\r\n\r\nlog = LoggingMixin().log\r\n\r\n\r\nclass DagBagFetcher(AirflowPluginDagSource):\r\n    def add_dags_to_dagbag(self):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def put_dags_on_disk(self):\r\n        home_dir = conf.get('core', 'airflow_home')\r\n        dag_repo_manifest = os.path.join(home_dir, 'dag_repositories.json')\r\n        if os.path.isfile(dag_repo_manifest):\r\n            log.info('Loading dag_repositories.json')\r\n            with open(dag_repo_manifest, 'r') as fp:\r\n                manifest = json.load(fp)\r\n                for repo in manifest['dag_repositories']:\r\n                    # ... download from s3\r\n                    # ... write to disk\r\n        else:\r\n            log.info('Could not find dag_repositories.json')\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Aip5Plugin(AirflowPlugin):\r\n    dag_sources = [DagBagFetcher]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you could include it in the core, by adding to setup.py\r\n\r\n```\r\n    setup(\r\n        # ...\r\n        'entry_points': {\r\n            'airflow.plugin': [\r\n                'dag_repo_loader = airflow.plugin.dag_repo_loader:Aip5Plugin'\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    )","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485105277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485116449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5117#issuecomment-485116449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5117","id":485116449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTExNjQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"ryanyuan","id":7124535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQ1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7124535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-20T13:11:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T13:11:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Unfortunately there was a transient error in Travis (I hope we can get rid of those soon).

But it will be confusing to tell the```airflow.webserver.graph.load_time``` stat from client side if they encounter page load time performance issue. Most of the page load time is spent on JS side, not on Flask side. I think most of the server side metrics are good to have.

little delayed response, but some thoughts below. Thanks for the feedback!\r\n - Yeah this PR mainly focuses on the server side metrics. More specifically, it adds metrics for server data fetching / processing for 2 of the most used client side views (more to follow later).\r\n - JS does play a major role in rendering, but unless there are AJAX server side calls in JS, most of them are usually rendering, which for now feels like the smaller of the bottlenecks, unless the code goes wrong somewhere? Ideally we should track both metrics eventually as mentioned above. One way I considered was using a statsd-client module available for java script as well using NPM. But that might merit a longer proposal.\r\n - I agree with the idea that the errors should be collected and monitored, and that will effectively be done the same way the scheduler Statsd metrics are monitored today right? The aim for the metrics here is to provide regression test and alerts for the UI before clients have to report it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485254447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485255300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5114#issuecomment-485255300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5114","id":485255300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTI1NTMwMA==","user":{"login":"kurtqq","id":47721902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzIxOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47721902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq","html_url":"https://github.com/kurtqq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurtqq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-21T14:17:47Z","updated_at":"2019-04-21T14:17:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kaxil maybe i'm missing something.

Thank you for the detailed explaination. The more I think and dig into the issue the more interesting it becomes. Here's what I think:\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly fine to implement some hooks for the use of both core Airflow and plugins. But in that way I think the code belongs more to the utils module instead of the plugin module.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, writing a hook to be used by both core and plugin is not what we are trying to pursue in this PR. From what I'm understanding, we're trying to make the DAG loading plugable. And I'm 100% supportive for this philosophy. In my imagination, to achieve this we would need roughly two steps, 1. is to extract a layer of abstration on DAG fetching in Airflow core and 2. is to make this layer plugable. I think both of them are within the scope of AIP-5 and seems like you are trying to achieve the latter in this PR.\r\n\r\nIf what I was describing makes sense, then I think it is better to finish 1. first if we don't do 1. and 2. together. And about the implementation details of 2., to keep stuff consistent, I'd prefer to do it like [how we do plugin executor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/executors/__init__.py#L84-L95), which we kinda need to have 1. in place to start.\r\n\r\n\r\n@ashb I image we'd still need local files as cache or so, but maybe this is not what you meant _need_.\r\n\r\n@milton0825  I'm sorry I didn't look close enough when u start the DISCUSS thread but one thing just came aross my mind is that we may want to make the DagFetcher module plugable, people like @drewsonne, me and more would love to have that( not saying that you didn't plan it, just didn't see it get pointed out loud in the AIP)\r\n\r\n@ashb @milton0825 @feng-tao Is above something similar to what you guys have in mind?  I just start to put more thoughts into this and likely you guys got something better :D would love to hear more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485331808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/485339826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5085#issuecomment-485339826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5085","id":485339826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTMzOTgyNg==","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T06:33:02Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T06:33:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@KevinYang21 \r\nThanks for the feedback! What I envision about remote DAG fetcher is that we can have multiple DAG repos using different storage options (e.g. git, s3, hdfs) at the same time. We will use a `dag_repositories.json` that records the URI to different repo. DAG fetcher would look at the URI and use different implementation (GitDagFetcher, S3DagFetcher) to fetch the DAGs.\r\n\r\nBut I think we should also allow people to register their own DAG fetcher plugin through a similar way to https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/executors/__init__.py#L84-L95 as you point
