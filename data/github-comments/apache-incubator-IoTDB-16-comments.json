This side effect has been noticed but back to then, AsyncApplier is merely in the experimental stage. Since you have fixed one of the problems, I would like to give some pieces of advice to make AsyncApplier complete:\r\n> \r\n> 1. When starting to take a snapshot, record the current commitIndex.\r\n> 2. Block until all logs whose indices <= the recorded commitIndex are applied. (Use RaftLogManager to do so instead of LogApplier)\r\n> 3. Prevent the log cleaner thread to clean logs that are not applied.\r\n> 4. Change `StorageEngine.getInstance().syncCloseAllProcessor();` in `takeSnapshot()` to send a flush plan within the group. (So the file sequence will not be broken by snapshots)\r\n> 5. When committed logs are recovered during start-up, re-apply all of them. (Notice that operation sequences in IoTDB are idempotent)\r\n\r\nGreat suggestion, I think the 1-3 items you mentioned is to make sure that when do snapshot, new logs can not be added and the snapshot task should not take long time.  however now the implementation can block the new logs coming in, as when do snapshot we should get the _logManager_ lock, so new logs can not be committed(commited log also  need to get the  _logManager_ lock ), we just need to wait all the previous committed log applied when do snapshot.\r\n\r\nI'm going to rethink the 4-5 suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/676856963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/676914299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/issues/1636#issuecomment-676914299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/1636","id":676914299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjkxNDI5OQ==","user":{"login":"ope-nz","id":26259049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjU5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26259049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz","html_url":"https://github.com/ope-nz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ope-nz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T03:10:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T03:10:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Actually sorry, it appears to be the way I combined the dependencies that is causing it.

So, we need to markFailedMeasurementInsertion manually for insertRowPlan.\r\n> \r\n> (2)\r\n> insert into root.turbine1.d1(timestamp,s1,s2) values(1,1.1,2.2);\r\n> delete timeseries root.turbine1.d1.s1\r\n> restart IoTDB\r\n> select * from root\r\n> \r\n> This will throw a metadata exception when querying the schema of the InsertPlan, because a measurement is deleted in MManager.\r\n> \r\n> One way to fix this is to add a parameter of IoTDB.metaManager.getSchemas() indicating that it should return a MeasurementSchema[] with some nulls instead of throw exception when recovering wal.\r\n> \r\n> Finally, it's better to recover the two cases by an IT.
