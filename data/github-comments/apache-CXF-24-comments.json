The necessary constructor is found in 11 / 29 Exceptions (openJDK17+35). For example SecurityException has it, and IllegalAccessException does not.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 exceptions (ClassNotFoundException, EnumConstantNotPresentException, TypeNotPresentException) in java.lang that have their own member variables.

Even before upgrading the baseline, we could perhaps avoid calling `Subject.getSubject(AccessController.getContext())` if the current Java Runtime is 18+ and `System.getSecurityManager()` returns

AFAIK, there is no relation between  `System.getSecurityManager()` returning `null` and `Subject.getSubject(AccessController.getContext())` . The only setting that matters is `-Djava.security.manager=allow` which is sadly is hidden inside `System::allowSecurityManager()` class, having access to it would have been helpful to not call `Subject.getSubject()` at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2488550074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2492460587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/2160#issuecomment-2492460587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/2160","id":2492460587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR86Uj-4r","user":{"login":"ffang","id":663583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang","html_url":"https://github.com/ffang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ffang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-21T22:18:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T22:18:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @Riggs333 ,\r\n\r\nThanks for contribution!\r\n\r\nCould you please create a jira ticket for this issue?\r\nFreeman","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2492460587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2492491329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/2160#issuecomment-2492491329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/2160","id":2492491329,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR86UkGZB","user":{"login":"Riggs333","id":787481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzQ4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/787481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333","html_url":"https://github.com/Riggs333","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Riggs333/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-21T22:35:52Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T22:35:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ffang,\r\nthank you for your quick response! 🙏🏻 \r\n\r\nI just created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-9085.\r\nPlease feel free to adjust it to whatever it needs to be.

I am afraid it was not double-logging by the server and the client.  Yes, both server and client logged the response.  But the server logged the response once (indicated by \"Outbound Message\" label), and the client logged the response twice (indicated by \"Inbound Message\" label).  In fact, because of the null body, it caused Camel to fail afterwards.  Please note this was done using Camel without synchronous=true on the endpoint - I am under the impression that with the async support in CXF http client, we do not have to use synchronous=true with Camel.  Here is the log generated by the test project I submitted:\r\n\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.341-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [ - timer://test] o.a.c.interceptor.LoggingOutInterceptor  : Outbound Message\r\n---------------------------\r\nID: 1\r\nAddress: http://localhost:8081/test/user\r\nHttp-Method: PUT\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nHeaders: {cache-control=[no-cache], Content-Type=[application/json], Content-Language=[en_US], Connection=[Keep-Alive], Accept=[*/*]}\r\nPayload: {\"id\":4,\"name\":\"Charlie Parker\"}\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.512-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [qtp669781254-80] o.a.c.interceptor.LoggingInInterceptor   : Inbound Message\r\n----------------------------\r\nID: 2\r\nAddress: http://localhost:8081/test/user\r\nEncoding: UTF-8\r\nHttp-Method: PUT\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nHeaders: {Accept=[*/*], Cache-Control=[no-cache], connection=[keep-alive], Content-Language=[en_US], Content-Length=[32], content-type=[application/json], Host=[localhost:8081], User-Agent=[Apache CXF 4.1.0]}\r\nPayload: {\"id\":4,\"name\":\"Charlie Parker\"}\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.525-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [qtp669781254-80] route1                                   : request received {\"id\":4,\"name\":\"Charlie Parker\"}\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.533-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [qtp669781254-80] o.a.c.interceptor.LoggingOutInterceptor  : Outbound Message\r\n---------------------------\r\nID: 2\r\nResponse-Code: 200\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nHeaders: {uri_eb_url_any=[user], Accept=[*/*], Cache-Control=[no-cache], User-Agent=[Apache CXF 4.1.0], connection=[keep-alive], Host=[localhost:8081], Content-Language=[en_US], Content-Type=[application/json], Date=[Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:39:49 GMT]}\r\nPayload: {\"result\": \"Ok\"}\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.545-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [ult-workqueue-2] o.a.c.interceptor.LoggingInInterceptor   : Inbound Message\r\n----------------------------\r\nID: 1\r\nResponse-Code: 200\r\nEncoding: ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nHeaders: {Accept=[*/*], Cache-Control=[no-cache], Content-Language=[en_US], Content-Type=[application/json], Date=[Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:39:49 GMT], Host=[localhost:8081], Server=[Jetty(12.0.16)], Transfer-Encoding=[chunked], uri_eb_url_any=[user], User-Agent=[Apache CXF 4.1.0]}\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.545-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [ult-workqueue-1] o.a.c.interceptor.LoggingInInterceptor   : Inbound Message\r\n----------------------------\r\nID: 1\r\nResponse-Code: 200\r\nEncoding: ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nHeaders: {Accept=[*/*], Cache-Control=[no-cache], Content-Language=[en_US], Content-Type=[application/json], Date=[Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:39:49 GMT], Host=[localhost:8081], Server=[Jetty(12.0.16)], Transfer-Encoding=[chunked], uri_eb_url_any=[user], User-Agent=[Apache CXF 4.1.0]}\r\nPayload: {\"result\": \"Ok\"}\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.548-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [ult-workqueue-2] route2                                   : response received: \r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.548-05:00  INFO 8592 --- [ult-workqueue-1] route2                                   : response received: \r\n2024-12-23T19:39:49.549-05:00  WARN 8592 --- [ult-workqueue-2] o.a.c.i.engine.DefaultReactiveExecutor   : Error executing reactive work due to null.

Hi @reta,\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for looking into this again. I am afraid it was not double-logging by the server and the client. Yes, both server and client logged the response.\r\n\r\nHi @jyinpci , I think you are very right, and I believe I could reproduce the issue successfully now - the key is to use `async()` client invocation, and with it, the response callback is called twice. I don't have a fix yet but I do have tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2564085650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/2564956013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/2174#issuecomment-2564956013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/2174","id":2564956013,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQMOR86Y4h9t","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-30T02:13:21Z","updated_at":"2024-12-30T02:13:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded
