And I randomly checked some modified files, they are modified after first introduced spotless plugin at 2019/10/10. The master won't broken as this PR is rebased to master branch. \r\nPS: And my another question is that if we need to modify `checkstyle-suppressions.xml` to make Reformat in IntelliJ and checkstyle.xml pass? but the spotless plugin would fail because of the identation is 4 after Reformat and the checkstyle.xml would also pass because of `<suppress checks=\"indentation\" files=\".\" lines=\"1-9999\"/>` in checkstyle-suppressions.xml, but the spotless plugin would fail and I would not find a way to make three all pass (above jira tickets to tracking this to document it clearly). But after running `mvn spotless:apply`, we could make build pass.  cc @bvaradar @vinothchandar

Basically I pass in insert records for which delete records will be generated. If we go with previous approach of generating random deletes, I couldn't verify if deletes actually deleted some records. So, have taken this approach.\r\n> \r\n> Steps I plan to add to Quick start is as follows\r\n> \r\n> * Generate a new batch of inserts.\r\n> * Fetch all records from this new batch (// fix the rider value below since each batch will have unique rider value)\r\n>   val ds = spark.sql(\"select uuid, partitionPath from  hudi_ro_table where rider = 'rider-213'\")\r\n> * Generate delete records\r\n>   val deletes = dataGen.generateDeletes(ds.collectAsList())\r\n> * Issue deletes\r\n>   val df = spark.read.json(spark.sparkContext.parallelize(deletes, 2));\r\n>   df.write.format(\"org.apache.hudi\").\r\n>   options(getQuickstartWriteConfigs).\r\n>   option(OPERATION_OPT_KEY,\"delete\").\r\n>   option(PRECOMBINE_FIELD_OPT_KEY, \"ts\").\r\n>   option(RECORDKEY_FIELD_OPT_KEY, \"uuid\").\r\n>   option(PARTITIONPATH_FIELD_OPT_KEY, \"partitionpath\").\r\n>   option(TABLE_NAME, tableName).\r\n>   mode(Append).\r\n>   save(basePath);\r\n> * Same select query above should fetch 0 records since all records have been deleted.\r\n>   spark.sql(\"select uuid, partitionPath from  hudi_ro_table where rider = 'rider-213'\").count()\r\n\r\nPlan sounds good. I think there are some checkystyle issues in the build.

I'll start rearranging the code and go from there.\r\n\r\nBtw, the CSV Source PR (HUDI-76) depends on this.
