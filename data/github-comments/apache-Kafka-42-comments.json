The patch doesn't seem to fix the issue completely though. The problem that I am seeing is that when there is only 1 replica in ISR, the only time that we will update HW is when a new message is appended. So, if no new message is appended and we roll a log segment, HW will stay on the old segment. Now, if a new fetch request comes in with log end offset, log.fetch() will return the new segment in LogOffsetMetadata. Then, in DelayedFetch.tryComplete(), since the fetch offset is not on the same segment as HW (even though offset is the same), we will complete the fetch request immediately and therefore incorrectly ignore max wait time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180551456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180552183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/873#issuecomment-180552183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/873","id":180552183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDU1MjE4Mw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T20:58:21Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T20:58:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180552183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/180553486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/878#issuecomment-180553486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/878","id":180553486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDU1MzQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"granders","id":1295932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders","html_url":"https://github.com/granders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T21:03:52Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T21:03:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ismael @ewencp Trivial change;

I have added reasoning behind adding hadoop-core dependency. I am open to suggestion, if that can be avoided somehow. Without changing APIs, which seems not essential for default authorizer, I could not find a better way to pass requesting user's info to authorizer.
