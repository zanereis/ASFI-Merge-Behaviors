Depending on the implementation, the buffer size may or may not make a difference.\r\n- There are frequent requests for `NotifyChangeDirectory` on a root drive `C:\\` that might cause NetBeans to receive more file system notifications than it needs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1587596787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1587668924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5634#issuecomment-1587668924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5634","id":1587668924,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5eoee8","user":{"login":"BruceKHaddon","id":102705941,"node_id":"U_kgDOBh8rFQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102705941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon","html_url":"https://github.com/BruceKHaddon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BruceKHaddon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-12T16:28:44Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T16:28:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, indeed.

It's only a problem inside IDE when trying to \"Run\" a class with main method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1588876975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1588883003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5826#issuecomment-1588883003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5826","id":1588883003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5etG47","user":{"login":"morvael","id":1133953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzM5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1133953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael","html_url":"https://github.com/morvael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-13T09:14:25Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T09:14:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\r\n[org.apache.ibatis.io.VFS] [main] [DEBUG] [org.apache.ibatis.io.VFS$VFSHolder] [createVFS] [74] : Using VFS adapter org.apache.ibatis.io.JBoss6VFS\r\n[org.apache.ibatis.io.ResolverUtil] [main] [DEBUG] [org.apache.ibatis.io.ResolverUtil] [addIfMatching] [287] : Checking to see if class SomeClass matches criteria [is assignable to Object]\r\n```\r\nIn NB 18 due to the swtich from target/classes to maven repository jar the second line will not appear, SomeClass will not be found by scanning, and thus ClassNotFoundException will be thrown when loading result map xml.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1588883003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1588900032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5826#issuecomment-1588900032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5826","id":1588900032,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5etLDA","user":{"login":"morvael","id":1133953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzM5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1133953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael","html_url":"https://github.com/morvael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-13T09:24:41Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T09:24:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I actually worked with compile on save disabled for a long time, since it caused some bug (long forgotten what it was), but the IDE simply used last version of target/classes from regular build and was able to scan them properly.

In fact, my core point is to merge the functionality of the two views to complement each other, and the development team can make a comprehensive consideration as to whether to actually merge the two views. It is important to emphasize that the key word for the purpose of my proposal is **\"convenience\"**, because as of now, Netbeans is not really convenient for viewing files. This can be referred to Eclipse, Idea, VSCode and other IDEs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1590306042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1590309386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5900#issuecomment-1590309386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5900","id":1590309386,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5eyjIK","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-14T01:38:22Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T06:03:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rossluk Please submit it as a new issue with an example once.
