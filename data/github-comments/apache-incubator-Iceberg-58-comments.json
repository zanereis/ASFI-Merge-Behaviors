We actually enable `objectReuse` by default so that chained operators can avoid the serialization and deserialization cost, which is huge for embarrassingly parallel DAGs. That is mainly for operator chaining.\r\n\r\nSo I understand why we'd want to enable object reuse, but is there any concern that end users who use Iceberg in their job graphs might get confused as object reuse is not the default flink behavior?\r\n\r\nI don't think this should be a blocker anywhere, but if we merge this, we should definitely be sure to document it. I know at my work we don't enable object reuse by default because of scenarios like @stevenzwu mentioned where users update fields on with object references in heap-based backends (like assigning mutable objects directly without cloning etc).\r\n\r\nThe patch is pretty large and I don't mean to be a blocker, but can we please be sure we document where this behavior deviates from a typical Flink program? I guess one could argue that since it's only in the InputFileFormat that it's relatively abstracted away from the users, but I think we should at least consider updating the docs to reflect this potentially unexpected change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/718371436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/718374609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1649#issuecomment-718374609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1649","id":718374609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODM3NDYwOQ==","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T05:46:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T05:46:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can somebody assign this issue to me?

Considering that the object doesn't even appear until a stream is closed, which can be any amount of time, it leads to any number of potential race conditions. Seeing as how `create()` is not used anywhere currently, we should leave this unimplemented until the need arises and revisit this decision at that time.\r\n\r\nSorry for the late reply, somehow I missed the notification...\r\n\r\nI personally think it makes more sense to implement our own version of `AmazonS3URI` as Ryan suggested. Here are my reasons:\r\n\r\n1. As mentioned in the AWS SDK Github issue you cited, the use of S3 URI is chaotic. There are multiple different versions of the URI string and the old `AmazonS3URI` only supports a very specific subset. So it's understandable to not have a standard `AmazonS3URI` class provided by the new AWS SDK. If you look into the code of the class, it's just parsing a string using the regex pattern `^(.+\\\\.)?s3[.-]([a-z0-9-]+)\\\\.`, so it is not hard to have a custom URI parser on Iceberg side to do the work.\r\n2. some customers are now using `s3a://` URI to be able to use `HadoopFileIO`, so we might need to add additional support to also accept this type of URI for an easy migration to `S3FileIO`. Currently using `AmazonS3URI` will throw exception for this use case. Implementing our own version of URI parser would be an easy way to achieve this.\r\n3. After all, `S3FileIO` will only write to S3. If a user chooses to use this FileIO, it might even make sense to accept a file path instead of a URI. For example, simply use `/my-bucket/my/file/path` to write to a S3 location. Currently `HadoopFileIO` already has this behavior, where a file path will write to the default file system specified in Hadoop config.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/719050513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/719087312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1573#issuecomment-719087312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1573","id":719087312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxOTA4NzMxMg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T23:48:59Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T23:48:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Dan and I had a discussion about `create` and came to an agreement to implement it, but to make sure the docs for it don't make claims about atomicity.

I don't think this should be committed. It is not safe to automatically roll back if there is a problem loading the current metadata file because the changes in the current metadata file are lost.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where the current metadata file may not be found. The S3A file system may throw `NotFoundException` because of negative caching in S3, even though the metadata file exists. If that happens, then this would silently roll back anything committed in the current metadata. There are other cases where this may happen as well and we simply don't know why the current metadata file was deleted. Assuming a specific cause is not a viable solution.\r\n\r\nThe problem in #1688 is that the Hive table was updated, but the operation appeared to fail on the client. The client deletes the metadata file from the commit attempt so that the commit cannot be accidentally successful (the case you hit) because the client will throw an exception that will very likely result in a retry. For example, Flink appending files will keep trying to append the same files.\r\n\r\nI think the right solution to the problem is to improve the handling in the commit path, not the read path. The commit path can load the table again and check whether the metadata file is the one it attempted to commit. If it is, then it can return success instead of deleting the metadata file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/720141602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/720141796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1688#issuecomment-720141796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1688","id":720141796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDE0MTc5Ng==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-01T19:51:01Z","updated_at":"2020-11-01T19:51:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think a fix for this needs to happen during commit, not during read.

I don't think this should be committed. It is not safe to automatically roll back if there is a problem loading the current metadata file because the changes in the current metadata file are lost.\r\n> \r\n> There are cases where the current metadata file may not be found. The S3A file system may throw `NotFoundException` because of negative caching in S3, even though the metadata file exists. If that happens, then this would silently roll back anything committed in the current metadata. There are other cases where this may happen as well and we simply don't know why the current metadata file was deleted. Assuming a specific cause is not a viable solution.\r\n> \r\n> The problem in #1688 is that the Hive table was updated, but the operation appeared to fail on the client. The client deletes the metadata file from the commit attempt so that the commit cannot be accidentally successful (the case you hit) because the client will throw an exception that will very likely result in a retry. For example, Flink appending files will keep trying to append the same files.\r\n> \r\n> I think the right solution to the problem is to improve the handling in the commit path, not the read path. The commit path can load the table again and check whether the metadata file is the one it attempted to commit. If it is, then it can return success instead of deleting the metadata file.\r\n\r\nthanks @rdblue  ,I will add some retry on commit and try checking  whether the metadata file is the one it attempted to commit before  deleting the metadata file .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/720234894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/720259098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1684#issuecomment-720259098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1684","id":720259098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDI1OTA5OA==","user":{"login":"zanmeipaul","id":20592867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTkyODY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20592867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul","html_url":"https://github.com/zanmeipaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanmeipaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-02T06:10:04Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T06:10:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"1. hive create table\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE customers\r\nSTORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler' \r\nLOCATION '/data/iceberg_catalog/test/customers'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES ('iceberg.mr.table.schema'='{\"type\":\"struct\",\"fields\":[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"customer_id\",\"required\":true,\"type\":\"long\"},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"first_name\",\"required\":true,\"type\":\"string\"}]}');\r\n\r\n2. flink operation table\r\ntableEnv.executeSql(\"CREATE CATALOG iceberg_catalog WITH (\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'type'='iceberg',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'catalog-type'='hive',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'uri'='thrift://dcwork03:9083',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'default-database'='test',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'clients'='5',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'warehouse'='/data/iceberg_catalog/test/customers',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t//\"  'hive-conf-dir'='/Users/zhongbaoluo/Applications/app/apache-hive-3.1.2/conf/',\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\"  'property-version'='1'\\n\" + \r\n    \t\t\t\")\");\r\n\r\ntableEnv.executeSql(\"SELECT `customer_id`,first_name from iceberg_catalog.test.customers\").print();\r\n\r\nerror:\r\n\r\n+----------------------------+\r\n|                 table name |\r\n+----------------------------+\r\n|                  customers |\r\n|                   ld_test1 |\r\n|                     orders |\r\n|                  orders002 |\r\n|                   orders02 |\r\n|                 partitest2 |\r\n|                  t_dc_user |\r\n| t_mpos_integral_sign_water |\r\n|                update_test |\r\n+----------------------------+\r\n9 rows in set\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.flink.table.api.ValidationException: SQL validation failed.
