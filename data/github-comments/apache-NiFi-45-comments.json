Thank you so much for the feedback!\r\n\r\nFor the biggest issue -- using expression language for Project ID as per the request of @fmaritato -- I couldn't figure out an easy way of incorporating that functionality. The general pattern of NiFi processors seems to be \"create a connector object when scheduled\", and in the case of the GCP java libraries, the connector client *requires* a Project ID to be set in its configuration. Changing it to be dynamic on a per-flowfile basis would require rebuilding the client configuration / instantiating it for each flowfile which seems like a pretty big red flag. If there are any suggestions there I'd like to hear them.\r\n\r\nEverything else should be resolved (hopefully) so if you have further suggestions or comments they would be welcome.

I've tested it with a standalone and cluster mode.\r\nAlthough uptime was displayed as expected, I felt the NiFi Cluster dialog became a little bit confusing because there are two 'Uptime' columns now. One is in 'NODES' tab, and another is 'JVM' tab.\r\n\r\nThe one in 'NODES' tab is actually a timestamp denoting when the node has started.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui/src/main/webapp/js/nf/cluster/nf-cluster-table.js#L498\r\n\r\nI'd suggest renaming the existing one in 'NODES' tab to something like `Started At`. How do you think?\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1107620/22921137/c48a1de6-f2db-11e6-85c9-f1e65ae565bc.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1107620/22921160/dae4d68a-f2db-11e6-93bb-2bc1282ba333.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/279640728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/279642690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1405#issuecomment-279642690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1405","id":279642690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTY0MjY5MA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T08:43:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T08:43:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/279642690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/279648348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1502#issuecomment-279648348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1502","id":279648348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTY0ODM0OA==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T09:06:29Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T09:06:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewed, ran tests, verified contrib-check.
