If you read this [issue](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3604) and this [pr](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3605), you can find that I found the problem of ApplyNameMapping change custom parquet schema before another merged pr, I checked other classes extend ParquetTypeVisitor and found RemoveIds has the same problem. I fixed both in this [pr](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3605), but no one reviewed. Yesterday I found the issue of ApplyNameMapping is solved in another pr and already merged, so I closed my last pr and extracted the part of RemoveIds here.

motivation.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/998408677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/998462433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3104#issuecomment-998462433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3104","id":998462433,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX847g1Ph","user":{"login":"hameizi","id":18445460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDQ1NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18445460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi","html_url":"https://github.com/hameizi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hameizi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-21T04:27:29Z","updated_at":"2021-12-21T04:27:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue

This is an update to #3293 that implements the `FileAppender` contract more closely to avoid test failures.\r\n>\r\n> This renames `writer` to `ensureWriterInitialized` and updates previous calls to `writer()` that would initialize the writer -- even if the appender was closed -- with null checks. `ensureWriterInitialized` is called when flushing a row group from the column write store to the file.\r\n\r\nI like this idea. My analysis on the former approach was the same as yours. There are also some fields that are built based off of the writer and associated factories that need to also be adjusted for lazy initialization (I believe). \r\n\r\nI'd be happy to also put a pair of

be clear, i encountered this issue by putting the iceberg Flink runtime jar into the lib directory as [Flink suggested](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/ops/debugging/debugging_classloading/#avoiding-dynamic-classloading-for-user-code).\r\n\r\nSo i tested another scenario next, submit the iceberg jar as user code.\r\nAs expected, it can work well for the first several jobs, then the followed job will fail on meta space OOM\r\n```\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace. The metaspace out-of-memory error has occurred. This can mean two things: either the job requires a larger size of JVM metaspace to load classes or there is a class loading leak. In the first case 'taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size' configuration option should be increased.

ConcurrentHashMap does not allow for computations to modify the hash map. This may livelock, deadlock, or may throw an exception (Java 9+).\r\n\r\nA `CacheWriter` performs its actions under a map computation to be atomic. This has since been deprecated and removed in 3.0. Your use-case of responding to evictions is either served by an `evictionListener` (atomic; notified within the `computeIfPresent` removing the entry) or `removalListener` (async; notified after the computation). Since your callback is removing more entries, it looks like an async removal listener might work better here.\r\n\r\nThe `refreshAfterWrite` feature will proactively reload an entry if accessed after the threshold period. This can combined with expiration so that active content is kept fresh and inactive fades away. If only expiration is used then one may periodically see a latency spike when a popular item expires and the callers block waiting for it to be loaded. If both expiration and refresh are set to the same threshold then the entry is discarded, as one setting says it stale and the other that it is unusable. \r\n\r\nThe scheduler is helpful when application logic relies on timely removal of an expired entry. For example to close a websocket after the client times out due to inactivity. As the cache itself does not start any background threads, by default it relies on other activity (reads, writes) to trigger a maintenance cycle when it will sweep away expired entries.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I would recommend against using soft references as they have long been a problematic Java feature. The usual reason is a lack of knowledge of a good maximum size, but delegating to the GC can cause high pause times and churn. Instead improving instrumentation and setting a size threshold allows for more predictable latencies, avoids GC death spirals / OOME, and allows for use of a better eviction algorithm.\r\n\r\nhope that helps a little.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1000053831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1000117806","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3776#issuecomment-1000117806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3776","id":1000117806,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX847nJYu","user":{"login":"yittg","id":4429171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkxNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg","html_url":"https://github.com/yittg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-23T08:05:59Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T08:05:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How about fixes this issue simply as #3797 ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1000117806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1000124516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3740#issuecomment-1000124516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3740","id":1000124516,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX847nLBk","user":{"login":"chenzihao5","id":38340392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzQwMzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38340392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5","html_url":"https://github.com/chenzihao5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzihao5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-23T08:18:11Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T08:18:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue I have updated test into existing test suite for Avro writer and reformat code style.
