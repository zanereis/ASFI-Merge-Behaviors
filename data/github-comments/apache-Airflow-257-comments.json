I think, it's a good idea to move transfer operators to separate python package. Currently, this division exists in integration.rst file.

Separate package make easier to move operators to separate pip package - library. In this situation, all dependencies in new library should be [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/).

Take a dag_folder of /opt/airflow/dags and /opt/airflow/dags/dag1.py\r\n\r\n- When parsing a single DAG file, create a dag bag like this https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/04da038100786da179f977df4eb2bab5352949d9/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1502 (for example `/opt/airflow/dags/dag1.py`)\r\n- So `dag_folder` is in fact the path to a single file, not the whole dag folder as we might expect from the name.\r\n- When it comes to do `filepath.replace(dag_folder, '')`:\r\n    * `filepath` is `/opt/airflow/dags/dag1.py`\r\n    * `dag_folder` is ALSO `/opt/airflow/dags/dag1.py`\r\n    * so the end result is `''`\r\n- So the final metric that is emitted is `'airflow.dag.loading-duration.'` (without a filename on the end) - At least from _this part_ of the scheduler the correct metric isn't emitted.

After some investigation, I realised that my changes were modifying the behavior of some tests.\r\nFor example this test in [`tests/minikube/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/tests/minikube/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py): \r\n```\r\ndef test_working_pod(self):\r\n        k = KubernetesPodOperator(\r\n            namespace='default',\r\n            image=\"ubuntu:16.04\",\r\n            cmds=[\"bash\", \"-cx\"],\r\n            arguments=[\"echo 10\"],\r\n            labels={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\r\n            name=\"test\",\r\n            task_id=\"task\"\r\n        )\r\n        k.execute(None)\r\n        actual_pod = self.api_client.sanitize_for_serialization(k.pod)\r\n        self.assertEqual(self.expected_pod, actual_pod)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does not specify the `in_cluster` argument.
