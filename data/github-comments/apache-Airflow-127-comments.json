When the airflow framework scheduler receives a resource offer from mesos master that has less resources than what is specified in this config, it rejects that offer. Or in other words, it accepts only those offers that have more or equal number of resources as mentioned in the config. But its a STATIC value. Same for all tasks for all DAGs. \r\nNow I'll preface this by saying I'm pretty new to airflow and specifically to the scheduler-foo logic but FWIK having able to specify cpu & memory per task for a DAG would require changes in airflow scheduler's code where it's creating `TaskInstance`s but it sounds like a suggestion worth exploring. \r\n\r\nRegarding having to specify both `docker` & `mesos` containerizers it looks like you are right. We need only one in this case - the `docker` one. Although I'm yet to try that out on my setup. Not getting enough bandwidth :( \r\n\r\nThanks for the architectural diagram. I did create a [basic architectural diagram](http://agrajmangal.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airflow_mesos.png) in [my first blog post](http://agrajmangal.in/blog/big-data/running-airflow-on-top-of-apache-mesos/) on this subject - See http://agrajmangal.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/airflow_mesos.png But I agree specifying more details like containers inside executors and webserver and scheduler also running on mesos slaves makes sense.

A new offer will be made to Mesos for each airflow task, in the code that you've written here, correct?

When a slave becomes free it notifies the mesos master and the mesos master ( based on its [allocation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/allocation-module/) strategy ) then creates resource offers and send them to registered frameworks. \r\n\r\nSo in our case airflow will receive some of these resource offers from Mesos master depending upon the allocator and how many resources are free, and then its upto the Airflow's MesosExecutor whether to accept or reject the offer. In its current form, the Mesos Executor has a queue where it has list of scheduled tasks and as it receives offers from Mesos master it checks for resources in that offer and if that resources value matches the expectations in the config then it accepts the offer and launches tasks on that mesos slave via master. Hope this clears it up.

AS count_1 \\nFROM slot_pool \\nWHERE slot_pool.pool = ?'] [parameters: ('*', u'test-pool')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurious how it worked in the past.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/372836389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/372841182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3015#issuecomment-372841182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3015","id":372841182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjg0MTE4Mg==","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T22:31:44Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T22:31:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It seems to be only failing in the new view tests I added, not the old view tests, so definitely an issue in my code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/372841182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/372847739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2330#issuecomment-372847739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2330","id":372847739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjg0NzczOQ==","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T23:01:03Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T23:01:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated PR.

can also find the path of the temporary bucket created for dataproc cluster using `project.regions.clusters.get` on dataproc resource under `config.configBucket`\r\n\r\nCheck: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.clusters#ClusterConfig\r\n\r\nYou can use an alternate approach to upload this file i.e. instead of uploading it to a bucket use the temporary bucket created for the DataProc cluster by first doing a get on the respective cluster and retrieving the name of the temporary bucket.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the idea of having a temporary bucket for Airflow makes more sense and this bucket can be used for multiple things.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/373745841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/373746272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3015#issuecomment-373746272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3015","id":373746272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzc0NjI3Mg==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T15:19:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T15:19:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are
