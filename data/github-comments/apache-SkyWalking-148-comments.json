query. Under the condition that the query conditions are unchanged, it can indeed improve the query efficiency. If the query conditions change dynamically, the improvement effect will not be obvious.Put all the query conditions into the filter, the effect is not very good.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/584063442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/584071547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4291#issuecomment-584071547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4291","id":584071547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDA3MTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T11:09:34Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T11:09:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"By

@wu-sheng \r\nNot only `my.cnf`, a `sharding-algorithm.jar` is necessary to be put into `install/shardingsphere/proxy/` to handle sharding tables and dbs. \r\n\r\nIf user plan to adopt sharding proxy as backend server, he has to download sharding proxy and copy `my.cnf`, and `sharding-algorithm.jar` from `install/shardingsphere/proxy`to specified dir.\r\n\r\nDo you think the above solution is feasible? And then how to specify my workload? Here is a task list from my understanding,\r\n\r\n1. Provide `my.cnf`, a `sharding-algorithm.jar` and put them into `install/shardingsphere/proxy/`\r\n2.Update `readme`\r\n3.Update `storage doc`\r\n4.Create e2e test referring to `test/e2e/mysql`\r\n\r\nIf i came to wrong conclusion, please be clear what i should do next.

Please take a look at the protocol, how to implement that? JS error has never been reported, we received error logs which you confirmed could be multiple.\r\n\r\nProbably, there are some gaps. It is definitive that client-js reports logs for one page in multiple times. There is  a common scene.\r\n\r\nWhen user load one page, page report resource errors, then user continue view the page for a few minutes, finally user click one button, page report js errors.\r\n\r\nFor the scene, when  client-js catch errors and report to server at once. It's impossible to get all the errors at once, as user need to trigger events.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about JS error rate, we need to calculate PV. \r\n`JS error rate = PV(pv with JS error in specified time) / PV (total PV in specified time)`\r\nFor PV with JS error in specified time, If server can't know which errors belong to which PV now, we can add a parameter to mark in error logs. After this, PV with JS error will be calculate. I think it is easy to calculate total PV in specified time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/584989598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/584990302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4343#issuecomment-584990302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4343","id":584990302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDk5MDMwMg==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T02:37:38Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T02:37:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The e2e still passed because the failure (download) stops the replacement of `application.yaml`, and it falls back to H2 storage, this is fixed by https://github.com/SkyAPMTest/e2e-container/commit/bf4cee3bd5488262a51b33d80fa2246f39ad019f and I just released e2e-container 1.5 https://hub.docker.com/r/skyapm/e2e-container/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated since @dmsolr you're upgrading the container versions in your PR, please upgrade them to 1.5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/584990302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
