I personally would say boot deletion should not be the default way.\r\n\r\nIf you do not accept this as a Bug do not accept solution proposal here,\r\ncould you please show me the correct configuration proposal.\r\n\r\nNote: In Karaf I do not get this error since I guess package is somehow boot delegated.

property to Marshaller. Then DataWriterImpl and AbstractJAXBProvider can both invoke this util method to set customized escape handler after marshaller created.  To support jdk's internal jaxb class, we may need to create a  minimum escape handler class with asm like what we did for NamespaceMapper.
