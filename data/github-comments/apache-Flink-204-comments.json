I also think of this question when implement this new type. Maybe I misunderstood the stephan's meaning from google doc.\r\n\r\nI proposed the new `BufferPoolListener` for interaction easily between `RemoteInputChannel` and `BufferPool`, because `RemoteInputChannel` may request more floating buffers and wants to be notified more than once, and the boolean return can decide the behavior easily. And it can replace the current `EventListener` provided in `BufferProvider` interface. In order not to affect the current process, I did not replace that in this PR.\r\n\r\nI referred to the existing code format when implementation and found many cases keep the space after `<p>`.

I was deploying our Flink job with this change. The Flink job failed to start, and log reports:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe implementation of the RichSinkFunction is not serializable. The object probably contains or references non serializable fields.\r\n\torg.apache.flink.api.java.ClosureCleaner.clean(ClosureCleaner.java:100)\r\n\torg.apache.flink.streaming.api.environment.StreamExecutionEnvironment.clean(StreamExecutionEnvironment.java:1548)\r\n\torg.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream.clean(DataStream.java:183)\r\n\torg.apache.flink.streaming.api.datastream.DataStream.addSink(DataStream.java:1131)\r\n```\r\n\r\nof which the implementation of the RichSinkFunction is FlinkKinesisProducer. The only field I add to FlinkKinesisProducer is KinesisProducerConfiguration. So I made KinesisProducerConfiguration `transient`, and added the following a serialization unit test, the unit test fails. \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\n\tpublic void testProducerSerializable() {\r\n\t\tProperties testConfig = new Properties();\r\n\t\ttestConfig.setProperty(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, \"accessKey\");\r\n\t\ttestConfig.setProperty(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, \"secretKey\");\r\n\t\ttestConfig.setProperty(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_REGION, \"us-east-1\");\r\n\t\ttestConfig.setProperty(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER, \"BASIC\");\r\n\t\tKinesisConfigUtil.validateAwsConfiguration(testConfig);\r\n\r\n\t\tFlinkKinesisProducer producer = new FlinkKinesisProducer(new KinesisSerializationSchema() {\r\n\t\t\t@Override\r\n\t\t\tpublic ByteBuffer serialize(Object element) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn null;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t@Override\r\n\t\t\tpublic String getTargetStream(Object element) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn null;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}, testConfig);\r\n\r\n\t\tClosureCleaner.ensureSerializable(producer);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus I doubted if FlinkKinesisProducer is already not serializable currently. To verify that, I ran the unit test for the current FlinkKinesisProducer in master which doesn't have my PR change. And it fails. Thus, I think something in FlinkKinesisProducer might not serializable, and already breaks FlinkKinesisProducer. \r\n\r\n@tzulitai @aljoscha  Any insights on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322101484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322103850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4473#issuecomment-322103850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4473","id":322103850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjEwMzg1MA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-14T05:34:53Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T05:34:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bowenli86 I think the test you posted above is failing because the provided `KinesisSerializationSchema` is not serializable.

I think it would be really important to create a following JIRA to introduce those changes in CEP, if we proceed with this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322841534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322850176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4554#issuecomment-322850176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4554","id":322850176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjg1MDE3Ng==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-16T17:56:04Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T17:56:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen Could you please have a look since this `ClassLoader` business is quite important to get right.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322850176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322854404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4553#issuecomment-322854404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4553","id":322854404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjg1NDQwNA==","user":{"login":"alpinegizmo","id":43608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/alpinegizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-16T18:11:34Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T18:11:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 I like these improvements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322854404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/322969031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4553#issuecomment-322969031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4553","id":322969031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjk2OTAzMQ==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-17T04:58:09Z","updated_at":"2017-08-17T04:58:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Thank you @uce.
