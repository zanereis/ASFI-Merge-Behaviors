Feedback, for both of us in the future: discuss implementation details like just add vertices and remove the list of edges before the code is written. 98% of the people would have kept the edge list for compatibility with the addVertex method that we already had. \n\nRegarding edge/vertex removal, I just changed the arg to List. A difference operator will not do us any good for various reasons: \n- that worked for union because the DataSet also had an union operator\n- fromCollection() will never take an empty data set as a parameter so when you do removeVertices, you cannot use the difference operator. Workaround: generate an empty set by adding and removing an element. But really? \n- when doing a \"difference\" on the vertices, you also need to remove the edges for which the vertex that disappeared was either source or target, so you will return a graph not a DataSet of vertices like is the case for union. Therefore a difference that operates on vertex data sets and returns a graph is exactly my removeVertices(). I guess you wanted to have Graph difference(graph) - back to argument 2. \n\nCould you describe what you meant by a difference similar to union in more detail? \n\nThanks!\nAndra \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105277029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105277082","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/722#issuecomment-105277082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/722","id":105277082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTI3NzA4Mg==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-25T17:47:21Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T17:47:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 to merge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105277082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105279617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/672#issuecomment-105279617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/672","id":105279617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTI3OTYxNw==","user":{"login":"nikste","id":11996097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11996097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste","html_url":"https://github.com/nikste","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikste/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-25T17:57:04Z","updated_at":"2015-05-25T17:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should work.

This is usually done for bigger changes, so that we can all agree before we start coding, instead of discovering disagreements during review. For small changes like this one, you can simply discuss implementation on the corresponding JIRA if you want or go ahead and implement the change and wait for the review :)\n\nSecond, my suggestions here are merely that: suggestions :) If you feel that what I'm suggesting doesn't make sense or you have a better idea, please discuss your view first before you start coding!\n\nRegarding compatibility, if a method is badly designed or can be improved, now is the time to fix it. Gelly is not even released yet, so -fortunately- we still have the time to improve things :)\n\nFinally, regarding the `difference` method, I meant a method that computes the difference of two graphs and returns a new graph containing the vertices and edges that the input graphs don't have in common. The idea is that when the user is dealing with lots of vertices / edges (DataSets), they can use `union` for additions and `difference` for removals. When the vertices / edges to be added / removed fit in a List, then the user can use the add/remove methods.

Therefore, the TwitterFilterSource class was not working and, therefore, TwitterFilterSource was also not working. Therefore, I have fixed the class TwitterSource and removed the old code. Now, it is working properly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105415577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105418301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/711#issuecomment-105418301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/711","id":105418301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTQxODMwMQ==","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-26T06:48:16Z","updated_at":"2015-05-26T06:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @rmetzger for the review.

The startup of the actor system is the longest delay in all client commands. For proper interactive behavior, we need to keep it running. Start it on first use, and stop it when the client is shut down. We need to make sure the client is always shut down, in the remote executor, and in the CLI frontend. \n- We can probably remove the \"lastJobID\" from the client, it seems redundant.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105982832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/105983100","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/681#issuecomment-105983100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/681","id":105983100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNTk4MzEwMA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-27T16:19:20Z","updated_at":"2015-05-27T16:19:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After a chat with @mxm , we decided it would be good to merge this sooner and fix point 2 (keeping the actor system alive) in a separate patch.

Thanks for all the effort you put into this. I think this will be a great addition to the project. :-)\n\n---\n\nI've skimmed over the code and checked it out. Some initial feedback:\n- **Naming UDF**. The feedback of committers giving talks about Flink some time ago was that the name \"UDF\" was sometimes confusing. @rmetzger, can you confirm this? We might take this into account and rename the `UdfAnalysisMode` to something else, for example just `CodeAnalysisMode`.\n- **Default mode**: the default mode is currently set to hinting. Running the WordCount example, it didn't work out of the box though. After some debugging I found this in the `UdfAnalyzer`, which prevented the analyis:\n  \n  ``` java\n  if (internalUdfClassName.startsWith(EXCLUDED_CLASSPATH)\n      && !internalUdfClassName.startsWith(\"org/apache/flink/api/java/sca\")) {\n      return false;\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  After commenting the second condition out, it worked fine. For a WordCount with a reducer, which only touches the second field of the Tuple2, it worked like a charm. The produced output looks like this:\n  \n  ```\n  23:23:49,207 INFO  org.apache.flink.api.java.operators.UdfOperatorUtils          - Function 'org.apache.flink.examples.java.wordcount.WordCount$Tokenizer' has been analyzed with the following result:\n  Number of object creations (should be kept to a minimum): 1 in method / 36 transitively\n  A need for forwarded fields annotations could not be found.\n  \n  23:23:49,217 INFO  org.apache.flink.api.java.operators.UdfOperatorUtils          - Function 'org.apache.flink.examples.java.wordcount.WordCount$1' has been analyzed with the following result:\n  Number of object creations (should be kept to a minimum): 1 in method / 1 transitively\n  You could use the following annotation: @ForwardedFields(\"f0->f0;\")\n  \n  23:23:49,243 INFO  org.apache.flink.api.java.operators.UdfOperatorUtils          - Function 'org.apache.flink.api.java.Utils$CollectHelper' has been analyzed with the following result:\n  Number of object creations (should be kept to a minimum): 0 in method / 6 transitively\n  A need for forwarded fields annotations could not be found.\n  ```\n  \n  Very nice to see this working. This is great news for the optimizer. :-)\n  \n  What do the transitive object creations refer to exactly? I'm wondering how a user could influence them? Reusing a result object in the WordCount sum reducer is correctly detected as 0 creations in the method as well.\n  \n  I was wondering whether it could be possible to configure code analysis on a per-function level. For example, all library related functions should not print the hints imo.\n\n---\n\nI very much like this. Regarding merging this before the release: I would vote to only merge it if we disable it by default. This will essentially affect every program written in the upcoming Flink release and merging it without proper review, testing, and exposure seems rushed to me.
