However, if the topology was launched in this manner, then it is unable to update if the topology is updated. It's as if the state from the UpdateTopologyManager point of view is stuck at the initial state. \r\n\r\nPerhaps whatever gets the SchedulerStateManagerAdaptor is not getting updated/functioning as expected?

Infact this looks like a bug to me. \r\nSchedulers should not be doing this truncating business. It should be done at a base layer(which is cli). Otherwise we will have the same situation like the one we have today where some schedulers handle it properly and others dont. For instance, aurora handles it fine(does a basename, and thats pretty much the only thing that it does). The others(including LocalScheduler) do not do that. Thus for instance if you submit a tar topology on localscheduler, it probably does not work.\r\nIs there a strong reason why schedulers would want the absolute filename?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/306348342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
