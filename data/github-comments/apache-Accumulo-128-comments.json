The following are the major diffs I uncovered while doing this.\r\n\r\n * Why make accumulo access optional jar in the assemble pom?\r\n * Should we deprecate ColumnVisibility.quote()?  There are two instances of that method (one for string and one for byte[]).  This branch deprecates one of those.  When I merged I removed the single deprecation and threw in a TODO.  If we want to deprecate, thinking we should do both or neither.\r\n * This branch had ColumnVis wrap and AccessExpression.  In #3746 ColVis was still wrapping a byte array instead of an AccessExpress.  I kept the byte[] to avoid going from byte[]->String->byte[] in some cases.  Also avoid an extra object allocation in some cases.  However I am not sure about this.  Wrapping the AccessExpression seems cleaner, but may be inefficient in some circumstances w/ more copies and object allocations.\r\n * The existing changes in #3746 did not need to add a new List<byte[]> constructor to AccessEvaluator, so I kept those.  So if we want to keep those, then may not need to add that method in accumulo-access.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1919501931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1919513093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4206#issuecomment-1919513093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4206","id":1919513093,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5yaXIF","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-31T16:53:42Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T16:53:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Why make accumulo access optional jar in the assemble pom?\r\n\r\nThat's just how the assemble pom dependencies are marked.

There are two instances of that method (one for string and one for byte[]).  This branch deprecates one of those.  When I merged I removed the single deprecation and threw in a TODO.

In [updates column visibility to use accumulo access library #3746](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3746) ColVis was still wrapping a byte array instead of an AccessExpress.  I kept the byte[] to avoid going from byte[]->String->byte[] in some cases.  Also avoid an extra object allocation in some cases.  However I am not sure about this.  Wrapping the AccessExpression seems cleaner, but may be inefficient in some circumstances w/ more copies and object allocations.\r\n\r\nI liked the simplicity of ColVis wrapping AccessExpression. The VisibilityEvaluator is changing to use AccessEvaluator, so the byte[] in ColVis *must* be a valid AccessExpression. In ColVis(byte[]) constructor, you are calling `AccessExpression.validate`, so I'm not sure that you are saving much w/r/t object creation. I wonder if the answer is for ColVis to have `AccessExpression` and `byte[]` members that are set in the constructor to avoid the runtime cost of calling `AccessExpression.getExpression`.\r\n\r\n> * The existing changes in [updates column visibility to use accumulo access library #3746](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3746) did not need to add a new List<byte[]> constructor to AccessEvaluator, so I kept those.  So if we want to keep those, then may not need to add that method in accumulo-access.\r\n\r\nFine by me, whatever

I assume you have seen [ClusterServerConfiguration](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/elasticity/minicluster/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/miniclusterImpl/ClusterServerConfiguration.java) in the elasticity branch? I didn't add it to the public API when I created it, but you could add an interface for it in elasticity, then backport it to main.\r\n\r\nYeah I am familiar with that and this conceptually builds on it, but moves from a mutable config model to a model of an immutable config.  I had not looked at that specific class recently, looking at it I changed some of the type and method names in this PR and that solved a problem I was having with being able to specify config that did not make sense.  Overall, still not sure about some of the names, initially my main focus was exploring this concept of immutable config so have not thought too much about the names and other aspects.\r\n\r\nHoping that the model of having an immutable sever config w/ [getters and setters](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/6c65321965c39cd2898c0158958a877a3536773e/minicluster/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/cluster/ClusterControl.java#L54-L92) in ClusterControl will allow us to simplify how tests start and stop servers. Also hoping that we can remove most of the methods in ClusterControl related to starting and stoping servers (I added TODOs in this PR about removing them).  Currently in elasticity the code will get a reference to the mutable cluster server config, change it, and then call methods on ClusterControl to start/stop servers.  Hoping this streamlines that a bit for our ITs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1927502099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1927536892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4225#issuecomment-1927536892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4225","id":1927536892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5y4-D8","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-05T17:31:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T17:31:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In 3.1.0 we could only update MiniAccumulo public API, but not change any internal test code.

There is a custom property in TableLoadBalancer (`table.custom.assignment.group`) that the balancer uses. Nothing else uses this as far as I know. \n\n>So make log sort happen within a specific resource group that makes sense for the particular WAL.\n\nIf we made the property a first-class citizen of the table configuration, then I think there are cases where recovery may never happen. Consider the case of a user deciding to change the way they access a table from IMMEDIATE to EVENTUAL. They shut down all the tablet servers and decide to bulk load and use scan servers. Some of the TabletServers don't stop cleanly so those tablets have walogs that may not get sorted and recovered.\n\nI have been thinking of a different approach because I think there is a danger of recovery not occurring. We made changes in #4229 to host a tablet regardless of availability for the purposes of recovery. We did this because if recovery does not happen, then ScanServers will not return the data in the walogs, the Compactor won't compact the data in the walogs, and the GC process will never delete the walog files. My proposal would be to embed the LogSorter in the Compactor and ScanServer in addition to the it's current location in the TabletServer. I think the Compactor processes should look for log sorting work before it starts a new compaction, and I think we setup the ScanServer to use the LogSorter just like the TabletServer does. The idea being that resource groups allow the user to dedicate resources to tables for specific things, but when a failure happens and recovery needs to occur all members participate for the accuracy of the data and safety to the system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1930431271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1930446989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/4233#issuecomment-1930446989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4233","id":1930446989,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5zEEiN","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-06T17:38:32Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T17:38:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it will also get missed when the exception is thrown for BAD_STATE.

Would be good to examine the current memory usage of log sort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1930478684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1930798102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/4233#issuecomment-1930798102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4233","id":1930798102,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5zFaQW","user":{"login":"ArbaazKhan1","id":29344877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ0ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29344877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1","html_url":"https://github.com/ArbaazKhan1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArbaazKhan1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-06T21:41:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T21:41:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think [Issue#4087](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/4087) might affect this ticket as well.

There are variants that are UUIDv7 compatible that allow for sub-second timing information if that precision is wanted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1932572797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1933020530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/4192#issuecomment-1933020530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/4192","id":1933020530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5zN41y","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-07T22:10:02Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T22:10:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the PR @ArbaazKhan1.
