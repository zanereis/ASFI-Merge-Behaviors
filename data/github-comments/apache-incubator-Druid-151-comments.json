A few things could potentially help here.\r\n\r\n1. You don't say what kind of filter you're using, but for range and prefix filters on string columns, \"bound\" and \"like\" perform substantially better than the alternatives. In your example LIKE \"10.0.0%\" should work best. For running these on IPs, it can help to store them in 0-padded hex encoding rather than dotted decimal, since that will make any subnet range or prefix search doable with a \"bound\" or \"like\" filter.\r\n2. Roaring bitmaps tend to work better than Concise for unioning large numbers of bitmaps, so you could try switching to those (at indexing time using `\"indexSpec\" : { \"bitmap\" : { \"type\" : \"roaring\" } }` in your tuningConfig).\r\n3. If you don't have any IPv6, you can also try loading the IP column as a \"long\" rather than the default of \"string\". Longs are currently unindexed in Druid, which may or may not hurt depending on your queries. So they tend to be faster sometimes and slower sometimes depending on your query. If you have IPv6 then this isn't doable since we don't have a numeric type that wide.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/315854317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/315857200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4557#issuecomment-315857200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4557","id":315857200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTg1NzIwMA==","user":{"login":"pjain1","id":11787983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzg3OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11787983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1","html_url":"https://github.com/pjain1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjain1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T19:29:47Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T19:29:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/315857200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/315859583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4556#issuecomment-315859583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4556","id":315859583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTg1OTU4Mw==","user":{"login":"viblo","id":1195272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTUyNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1195272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo","html_url":"https://github.com/viblo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viblo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T19:38:53Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T19:38:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"At the moment I only have a thetasketch of the IP to count them.

You can switch which one you get by using the CAST operator. But there isn't one that works well for version numbers.\r\n\r\nYou could probably write a SqlOperatorConversion that creates a new function that transforms version numbers into something that sorts properly as a string or a number, and then do order by that. Something like `SELECT DISTINCT version FROM tbl ORDER BY VERSION_SORTABLE(version)` where `VERSION_SORTABLE` is an operator you add in an extension. Maybe it transforms \"9.0.0.1\" to \"0009.0000.0000.0001\".\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could teach the SQL dialect about a new kind of ordering, but that can't be done through an extension, it would have to be done by a patch to druid-sql module itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/316759615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/316767863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4580#issuecomment-316767863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4580","id":316767863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc2Nzg2Mw==","user":{"login":"darkbluever","id":1259163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkxNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1259163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever","html_url":"https://github.com/darkbluever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkbluever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T17:03:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T17:03:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Additionally, in my situation, I need to use version comparison with bound filters, such as `SELECT DISTINCT version FROM tbl WHERE version >= '9.0.0.1' and version <= '10.1.0.0'`. \r\n\r\nMaybe I could write a SqlOperatorConversion and use the custom function like  `SELECT DISTINCT version FROM tbl WHERE VERSION_SORTABLE(version) >= VERSION_SORTABLE('9.0.0.1') and VERSION_SORTABLE(version) <= VERSION_SORTABLE('10.1.0.0')`?\r\n\r\nIf I do things like this,  what impact will be on performance?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/316767863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/316769085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4491#issuecomment-316769085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4491","id":316769085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc2OTA4NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T17:07:38Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T17:07:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This patch is a great step forwards, but it broke a lot of Druid SQL stuff.
