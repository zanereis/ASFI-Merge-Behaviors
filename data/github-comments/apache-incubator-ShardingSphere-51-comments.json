This submission is a bit sloppy. Thank you for taking the time to read the submitted code and pointing out the problem.\r\n\r\n1. Travis still broken. Right now, although the travis are not broken because of you create a new boolean to switch off your new codes. If the boolean value is switch on, I think the travis still broken. Can you add test cases for your new codes?\r\n\r\nA: Travis broken early , because of I forgot change import packages .... , I'v got a long path problem stop me to commit the all modules project from local storage .  Then I just edit the file in the github. I'm already mvn installed the all sphere in local . and cost a long time to saw many ( hurge number )tests done well . \r\n\r\n2. The problem is still existed for unlimited threads cause resources exhausted if the boolean value is switch on.\r\n\r\nA: Assume 10000 actual tables made , just used 100 threads connection to connect database , and just during the process assemby Map ( According to my understanding of these codes from origin ).And when the map result is ready it's just a result typed Map, and just a data , no threads exsist at all , nothing will run self , it's will as same result as the origin code, nothing different . When the project running smoothly, the database cost only by the CP pool from new connection , and the 100 connection created, ware already released after join() later. I don't agree that threads are made database exhausted when project running smoothly. because they already finished and joined , just left a Map data .\r\n\r\n3. The problem is still existed for refresh databases of orchestration module if boolean value is switch on.\r\n\r\nA: As No.2 . What every , I don't read all codes yet, sorry for that . But in my opinion .Map is already get ready ,  If there is any module will re-assemby all the Map , likely a 4 minute process \"orchestration\", it's sounds like a terrible process too . Will it suspend the program progress when the base metadata remaped ? If that needed to happen , duration also be shortly for better but minutes to suspend the program . If just need to change some of Map's element , may be there already had a function to point the changed entity. why use the TableMetaDataInitializer to initialize all of the map but not one element?  I don't believe TableMetaDataInitializer.load(ShardingRule) will be use for.\r\n\r\n4. We don't prefer include a temporary design for test mode only, we need to prove the new design are good enough for production code.\r\n\r\nA: ok and accept.  But , how to make sure all of them ? \r\nIn my case used spring , and several entity , several sharding tables. I'm difficult to write the unit test to assmby the environment , like database , sping runner , api controller . how to test the connection to the database ? connect to what , and how make sure the connection in unitTest run well after database not online ? uhhhh...   : )\r\n\r\n5 .System.out.print are not permitted.\r\nA: ok . \r\n\r\nAfter all , This submission is a bit sloppy.
