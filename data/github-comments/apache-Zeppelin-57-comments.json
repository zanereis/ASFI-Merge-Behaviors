good catch about a license text, thank you for taking care.\nSorry for a confusion, but indeed as soon as this PR do not include any source code copied form py4j itself - there is no need to add it to LICENSE file, as it tcove only source code releases.\nCould you update it again please?\n\nOtherwise it looks great to me - we should be good to merge right after final LICENSE update and moving

need to have a consensus between maintainers of each of those parts.\n\nI would suggest this PR to be separated on at least 3:\n- improving checkstyle conventions for Scala (\\w updated to documentation and CONTRIBUTING to showcase it, addressing @jongyoul comments)\n- refactoring `cassandra` to follow conventions\n- refactoring `spark` to follow conventions\n- refactoring `module N` to follow conventions\n\nThen each of them can be improved and reviewed fast and
