Also if destination is a POJO (v.s. a string), we can then add a\nSerializableFunctionWithSideInputs version later without breaking backwards\ncompatibility.

I think it makes sense to keep the doc about args in there: \r\nI initially thought  that it is a copy-paste mistake (due to lack of direct constructor), but your explanation & parent constructor explains it all. \r\n\r\nYour idea on validation is great: It'll remove the ambiguity caused by inherited constructor and also increase safety. Will create a Ticket / PR for that soon.
