I think there's something that was still missed in regards to the serialization/deserialization of the enum though. As it is, it stores a mapping of FlowFileAcquisitionMethod to a number. This number is no longer the ordinal. And when the event file is read, it reads in this mapping. However, it never does anything with the mapping.\r\n\r\nRather, it uses the mapping provided by FlowFileAcquisitionMethod. If the enumeration changes between version 1.11.0 and 1.12.0, for example, then when 1.12.0 reads the data, it will lookup value 1 according to definition in 1.12.0, which is similar to how it would work with the ordinal. Instead, if the FlowFileAcquisitionMethod is stored as a value of `1`, it must lookup what the value of `1` meant in the mapping that was serialized, NOT the mapping that is available in FlowFileAcquisitionMethod. Otherwise, the mapping doesn't help, and version 1.12.0 would still parse the record incorrectly, as a result of the enumeration changing.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? If not, please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/571711861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/571720056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3962#issuecomment-571720056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3962","id":571720056,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTcyMDA1Ng==","user":{"login":"shawnweeks","id":9768773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njg3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9768773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/shawnweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T18:50:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T18:50:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested using the use case from the original NiFi Registry Jira Issue.

The problem that I see is in the deserialization. In the EventIdFirstSchemaRecordReader, we read the list of Event Types as they were when the data was serialized: https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-provenance-repository-bundle/nifi-persistent-provenance-repository/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/provenance/EventIdFirstSchemaRecordReader.java#L119\r\n\r\nThen, when we deserialize the data, we provide that list of Event Types to the LookupTableEventRecord (https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-provenance-repository-bundle/nifi-persistent-provenance-repository/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/provenance/EventIdFirstSchemaRecordReader.java#L143).  This is the important piece that I think this PR is missing.\r\n\r\nLookupTableEventRecord determines the ProvenanceEventType like this, roughly (here, I've removed error handling, renamed variables for clarity, etc.):\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Get the integer value that was stored in the file.\r\nfinal Integer eventTypeOrdinal = (Integer) record.getFieldValue(EventFieldNames.EVENT_TYPE);\r\n// Get the name of the event. This is based on the List of Event Names that were stored in the file header.\r\nString eventTypeName = eventTypes.get(eventTypeOrdinal);\r\n// Get the ProvenanceEventType with that name.\r\nProvenanceEventType eventType = ProvenanceEventType.valueOf(eventTypeName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, what I believe this PR is doing is more like this:\r\n```\r\n// Get the integer value that was stored in the file.\r\nfinal Integer acquisitionType = (Integer) record.getFieldValue(EventFieldNames.FLOWFILE_ACQUISITION_METHOD);\r\n// Get the name of the acquisition type NOT from the List of Acquisition Types that were stored in the headers, but rather from the Enumeration (i.e., the current mapping of integer to name, rather than the mapping that makes sense for the data in the file) - this, I believe, is the problem.\r\nString acquisitionName = FlowFileAcquisitionMethod.flowFileAcquisitionMethodNames().get(flowFileAcquisitionOrdinal);\r\n// Get the acquisition method based on the name\r\nflowFileAcquisitionMethod = FlowFileAcquisitionMethod.valueOf(acquisitionName);\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/571789004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/571820508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3930#issuecomment-571820508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3930","id":571820508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MTgyMDUwOA==","user":{"login":"m-hogue","id":7054178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7054178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue","html_url":"https://github.com/m-hogue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-hogue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-07T23:24:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T23:24:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markap14 : You're totally right.

The beginning will be the serialization of the schema header, which is not sensitive and therefore not encrypted. After ~7300 bytes, you will find the beginning of the flowfile record serialization. In plaintext form, you would be able to read the attributes in plaintext. In encrypted form, you will see the Java serialization of the `RepositoryObjectEncryptionMetadata` class, containing `cipherByteLength`, `algorithm`, `ivBytes`, `version`, and `keyId`. Following those field names, you should see recognizable sequences like `K1` and `AES/GCM/NoPadding`.

I think we can simplify the code and the user experience a bit by avoiding the use of an empty string for Batch Size, as I indicated in the inline comments. But please do let me know if I misunderstood something.\r\n> \r\n> Another option that may further simplify things would be to set the default value of the Batch Size property 1. Then, in the custom validate, rather than check if it's set, check if the value is 1 or not. That way, you could actually avoid ever even having to check if the value is null, etc. because the validators guarantee that it's a positive integer and the default value guarantees that it is non-null. Up to you if you want to go this route, but I think it simplifies the code (and tends to adhere to common nifi patterns).\r\n\r\nHi @markap14,\r\n\r\nYes, this was my first approach.\r\n\r\nHowever, @turcsanyip suggested we should help the users notice if they misconfigure the processor by making sure that the otherwise valid _'Batch Size'_ values become invalid unless the prerequisites are met (i.e. _'Destination'_ is set to _'Content'_ and _'Grouping'_ is set to _'None'_).\r\nWith that we needed a valid value when the prerequisites are _not_ met, which would be the empty string.\r\n\r\nSo basically the user should clear the value if it's not going to be used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/573157022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/573431307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3966#issuecomment-573431307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3966","id":573431307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQzMTMwNw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-12T16:20:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-12T16:20:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tpalfy personally I am ok with either approach - to simple ignore the value when it doesn't make sense to use it (and document exactly when it will be used) or to require that no value be specified when it won't be used. I prefer the latter. And I think that you, @turcsanyip, and I are all in agreement there.\r\n\r\nWhat I am questioning here is rather the notion of allowing an empty string. I am suggesting that we should not allow an empty string to be set. Rather, it must be set to an integer or it must be unset. NiFi does distinguish between an unset value and a value set to an empty string. So my recommendations are as follows:\r\n- Just use the POSITIVE_INTEGER_VALIDATOR with the optional property. Do not wrap that validator in one that allows an empty string to be set.\r\n- In customValidate, require that the Batch Size be unset unless the Grouping and Destination are appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis approach is very consistent with the user experience offered elsewhere. It means that the user cannot set the Batch Size when it does not apply. It means that if it is set, it MUST be a positive integer. It also means that the code is simplified by not requiring the extra \"wrapping\" validator and that rather than checking `isEmpty` in a lot of places, we can just check if `null` (or `isSet()`) which tends to lend itself to code that is easier to understand.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/573431307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/573460350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3973#issuecomment-573460350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3973","id":573460350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQ2MDM1MA==","user":{"login":"shawnweeks","id":9768773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njg3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9768773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/shawnweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shawnweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-12T21:40:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-12T21:40:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added some integration tests.
