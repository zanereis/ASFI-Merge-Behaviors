The JSON config would define the metadata for the aggregation framework needs to operate. Adding new variables would create new pipelines or sets of pipes.\n\nSo it's just a place to store metadata that pipelines can read from. Arguably most of this metadata should be code and live in source control, but sometimes we need some settings to be more reactive and that's when we use variables.\n\nOur only internal use case now is a backfilling framework that allows us to run huge backfills efficiently.\n\nAnother thought is Airflow doesn't expose a way to communicate across tasks, or even for an upstream task influence the behavior of a downstream tasks.

Clearly Celery was a first stab at it that works pretty great, and having the CeleryExecutor is an asset, but moving forward we need containment, and to reuse existing infrastructure. I don't know much about Yarn and its APIs, but I thought that would be the way to go. Seems like ECS is another option.\n\nAirbnb will build and share a solution that works for us and hopefully for others, if your stack is different or take a different path (say we go Yarn and you want to go ECS), we'll collaborate to make sure we build an interface that works for both, but you'll have to implement that interface. \n\nIf you want to be part of the conversation on how to distribute tasks to workers I can reach out when the time comes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/110985703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/110985957","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/3#issuecomment-110985957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3","id":110985957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDk4NTk1Nw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-11T03:26:47Z","updated_at":"2015-06-11T03:26:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm starting work on a plugin system using yapsy, I'll paste a link to the PR here when it's baked.

If you do have access to an Airflow box, you pretty much have full access to all the systems Airflow interfaces with. We spoke internally about using Airflow for more sensitive datasets that not all engineers should have access to, and the solution there would be to setup an alternate Airflow environment for that purpose.\n\nThe UI is mostly a read-only UI, and there are different level of access there. It's possible to create a limited access where people can just look at pipeline definitions and how they progress.\n\nThe flask_login backdoor should allow you to do pretty much anything in terms of authentication. Our setup has a reverse proxy that takes care of ssl and ldap authentication that squeezes http headers in the request, and our `airflow_login` module just look for the headers to grant the right level of access. Using flask_login and ldap is probably fairly well documented.
