I see that there is already an index on this 4-arity tuple `dag_id, task_id, execution_date, state`, so since I am staying within the parameters of the queries this index was designed to optimize for, there shouldn't be a major performance hit.\n\nHappy to discuss this further; I would have tried to put together a PR myself but hadn't gotten around to it  due to time constraints and competing priorities :(\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/229805085/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/229806809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1641#issuecomment-229806809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1641","id":229806809,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTgwNjgwOQ==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T22:28:31Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T22:28:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@omnilinguist that's a great use case. Your code is more than a monkey patch, that looks like a pretty good `Operator` in and of itself.

I'm trying to get airflow working in production, but for some reason the scheduler stops working after a few hours.  I've added some more detailed logging and have tracked the issue back to the `while any(j.is_alive() for j in jobs):` loop introduced in this PR.  For some reason, after running fine for hours, the main process will get stuck in this loop.  I can run `top` on my airflow scheduler container and can see that the child process actually spawns, while the main process is looping endlessly using about 100% CPU.  From what I can tell, the `_do_dags` target function never actually runs when this happens.  Any ideas?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/231752125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/231810363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1473#issuecomment-231810363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1473","id":231810363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTgxMDM2Mw==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-11T17:47:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T17:47:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@schnie provide sample dag that exhibits this.
