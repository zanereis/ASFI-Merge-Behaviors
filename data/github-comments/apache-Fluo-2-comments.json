It also makes it easier to allocate resources per table.  \n- Easier resource allocation : If a high priority table is falling behind, add more workers just for that table using YARN.\n\nThe only advantage I can think of for making a singler worker process multiple tables, is the possibility of getting higher utilization on the cluster.   The worker would always keep its threads busy with whatever table had work.  Where in the case of a worker process per table, it may be that some of the worker processes on a node have many idle threads and some are utilizing all threads.   In the case of worker per table, we could possibly try to achieve high utilization by starting and stopping worker processes as needed.  Would need a centralized process to monitor and make these decisions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/50910437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/50910625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/22#issuecomment-50910625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/22","id":50910625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTEwNjI1","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T17:17:02Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T17:17:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am inclined to remove this from the 1.0.0 feature list in favor if using YARN to allocate resource, instead of fluo trying to do itself.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/50910625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/50915041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/101#issuecomment-50915041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/101","id":50915041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTE1MDQx","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T17:57:05Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T17:57:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm fine with the name Span.

Posting a design of this issue for review.   Once we feel the design is sound, we can move on to implementation.\n\nDefinitions :\n- Transactor : a process executing transaction.\n- IDLE       : transactor not currently executing any transactions\n- BUSY       : transactor currently executing transactions\n- TLTNODE    : transactor logical time node, each transactor will have an emphemeral node in zookeeper that tracks the oldes logical start time for transactions is currently executing  \n- START_TS   : a transactions logical start timestamp from oracle\n- TR[0-9]    : an instance of a transactor\n- GC[0-9]    : an instance of a garbage collection iterator\n\nTransactor rules\n- IDLE -> BUSY : must place TLNODE in zookeeper before executing any transactions\n- BUSY -> IDLE : delete TLTNODE\n- while BUSY : periodically update TLNODE with minimum START_TS from all transactions running.  Do not want to do this to frequently, it would put a lot of write pressure on ZK.\n\nGarbage collection iterator rules\n- in init() select a min timestamp, gciter will not remove anything newer than this while it runs.\n- when selecting timestamp, choose minimum from TLNODEs in zookeeper.  If no TLNODES in zk, grab timestamp from oracle.\n- when garbage collecting, leave at least one entry less than the minimum time selecting in init().  \n\nExample scenario of concurrent transactor and gc iters running\n1. start, set of TLNODEs in ZK is empty\n2. GC1 starts executing and grabs min time of 6 (from oracle.)\n3. TR1 transations from IDLE to BUSY\n4. TR1 sets its TLTNODE to 8 (allocated from oracle) before executing any transactions\n5. TR1 starts executing a transaction with a START_TS of 11\n6. TR1 starts executing another transaction with a START_TS of 15\n7. GC2 starts executing and selects a minimum timestamp of 8.\n8. GC1 encounters a row/column with versions at times 3,5,7,9.   It drops version 3\n9. GC2 encounters a row/column with versions at times 3,5,7,9.   It drops versions 3 and 5\n10. TR1 updates its TLNODE to 11\n11. GC3 starts executing and selects a minimum timestamp of 11.\n12. GC3 encounters a row/column with versions at times 3,5,7,9,15.   It drops versions 3,5, and 7\n13. TR1 finishes executing both transactions\n14. TR1 deletes its TLNODE after being idle for a bit\n\nCurrently transactions detect reading data past the point of garbage collection. This should be left as a sanity check.  Hopefully should not run into this case after this change.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/50919724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/50935390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/113#issuecomment-50935390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/113","id":50935390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTM1Mzkw","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-01T21:12:15Z","updated_at":"2014-08-01T21:12:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Specifically, the gpg plugin needs to be added.

GC5 looks in ZK and sees no TLNODEs\n2. TR7 transations from IDLE to BUSY\n3. TR7 set its TLTNODE to 18 (allocated from oracle)\n4. TR7 starts executing a transaction with a START_TS of 21\n5. GC5 grabs min time of 25 (from oracle.)\n6. GC5 encounters row/column RC1 with versions at times 3,22.   It drops versions 3\n7. TR7 transaction w/ START_TS of 21 reads RC1 and gets a stale scan exception\n\nI think garbage collection init() needs to always do the following.  The inital design called for optionally getting an oracle timestamp, if the TLTNODEs in zk were empty.  Thats what caused the problem above.\n1. long otime = &lt;allocate timestamp from oracle&gt;\n2. list<long> zktimes = &lt;get list of TLTNODEs from ZK&gt;\n3. gcMinTime =  min(otime, zktimes)\n\nThis tweak improves things, even for the hairy situation below.\n1. TR8 transations from IDLE to BUSY\n2. TR8 gets time 13 from oracle to set for its TLTNODE, but does not set it\n3. GC9 grabs min time of 15 (from oracle.)\n4. GC9 looks in ZK and sees no TLNODEs, so uses min time of 15\n5. TR8 set its TLTNODE to 13\n6. TR8 starts executing a transaction with a START_TS of 21 ()\n7. GC9 encounters row/column RC1 with versions at times 3,22.
