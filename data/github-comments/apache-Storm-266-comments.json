As you may know, field grouping is not intended to guarantee different values on given field are routing to the different tasks. So field grouping is closely matched to your situation but not perfect.</p>\n\n<p>2. What you suggest adds intermediate bolt which also adds overall latency. IMHO, it would be natural for window bolt itself to recognize the field and aggregate based on the value of the field, which means that users should take care of. Btw, it can be provided to the users via higher level API.

Thus, when we rebalance a smaller executors number for a component, the old bigger TOPOLOGY-TASKS is partitioned into smaller number of executors, it works [we finally reduce the executors], but some executors will have more than one tasks; When we rebalance a bigger executors number for a component, it doesn't work at all because the old smaller TOPOLOGY-TASKS is partitioned into bigger number of executors, so some executors will not have task assigned and will not start.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the old storm, if we have a topology named example-topology which contains component like Spout S1[1 executors] -- Bolt B1[2 executors] -- Bolt B2[4 executors], if we do a command `storm rebalance  example-topology -e B1=1` it will work, and the only executor for B1 will have 2 tasks inside; but for command `storm rebalance  example-topology -e B1=4`, it doesn't work at all and nothing changes finally.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, all the commands above work, and the ratio for tasks and executors of a component is always 1:1\r\n\r\n@revans2 @erikdw please help me to review this again, thx very much ^_^","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/273009556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/273020653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1835#issuecomment-273020653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1835","id":273020653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzAyMDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"liurenjie1024","id":2771941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzE5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2771941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024","html_url":"https://github.com/liurenjie1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liurenjie1024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T04:36:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T04:36:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@harshach OK I'll submit a PR for that later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/273020653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/273028595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1874#issuecomment-273028595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1874","id":273028595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzAyODU5NQ==","user":{"login":"erikdw","id":1111441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw","html_url":"https://github.com/erikdw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T05:51:01Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T05:51:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm unable to reconcile the statements about the ratio always being 1:1 with the content of your \"For example\" paragraph.  Those examples sound like you have a different number of executors than tasks.  Am I misreading them?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm not a clojure expert, so you probably wanna get a core contributor (e.g., Bobby Evans, Jungtaek Lim, someone else) to look at this.\r\n\r\nHowever, another Q that comes to mind is:  does this behavior also exist in the master branch at HEAD?  i.e., the Java-based code.   If so then you'll wanna do this change in Java too, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/273028595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/273029332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1874#issuecomment-273029332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1874","id":273029332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzAyOTMzMg==","user":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T05:57:30Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T05:57:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danny0405 right now rebalance to a higher number of executors is meaningful only if a component was provisioned with more number of tasks than executors during deploy time. \r\n\r\nMay be there is a reason why the number of tasks as not changed with rebalance. Say if the tasks are maintaining some local state and the inputs to the tasks are keyed on a field and the rebalance alters the number of tasks, the states will not be valid anymore since the same keys will not be mapped to the same tasks anymore.\r\n\r\nThe idea of dynamically increasing the tasks with rebalance is good, but we need to think through how to handle the key based partitioning use

great work to solve data skew.</p>\n\n<p>It has the effect of evenly emitting data to the next Bolt objects.<br/>\nHowever, the partial key grouping does not solve the Hash Collision problem in Windowing method.</p>\n\n<p>I simply switched <a href=\"https://github.com/dke-knu/i2am/tree/master/i2am-app/fields-window-grouping/src/main/java/org/fields/window/grouping/as_is\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the fields grouping</a> to <a

noopener\">the partial key grouping</a>.<br/>\nIn fact, I expected that when the Bolt's parallelism hint is greater than the number of fields, the hash collision problem will be solved.<br/>\nAs a result, the windows were evenly emitted to each Bolt instances, but they contained different fields.<br/>\nThat is, a hash collision problem occurred.</p>\n\n<p>The partial key grouping did not solve my problem, but instead I am interested in custom grouping.<br/>\nSo, I'll implement it with custom grouping instead of bolt added in <a

possible.</p>\n\n<p>Many
