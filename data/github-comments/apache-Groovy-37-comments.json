Is this easy with the changes?\r\n\r\nGood question. The added [publishIfAuthenticated](https://github.com/clayburn/groovy/blob/connect-to-ge.apache.org/gradle/build-scans.gradle#L31) requires the user running the build to be authenticated to ge.apache.org. ASF committers can authenticate local builds by logging in to ge.apache.org with LDAP credentials and [creating an access key](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/#authenticating). So effectively, this changes to opt-in rather than opt-out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1592992260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1595954577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1902#issuecomment-1595954577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1902","id":1595954577,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5fIFWR","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-18T04:55:32Z","updated_at":"2023-06-18T04:55:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1595954577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1596933008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1832#issuecomment-1596933008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1832","id":1596933008,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5fL0OQ","user":{"login":"Goooler","id":10363352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzYzMzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10363352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler","html_url":"https://github.com/Goooler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Goooler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-19T10:30:00Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T10:30:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It's outdated, handled by #1899.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1596933008/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1597007715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1832#issuecomment-1597007715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1832","id":1597007715,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5fMGdj","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-19T11:22:28Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T11:22:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Indeed, outdated.

From memory this was often around discussion for what the expectations would be for the `&=`, `|=` and `^=` operators.\r\n```\r\nvar nums = [5, 1] as SortedSet\r\nnums += 3\r\nassert nums.toString() == '[1, 3, 5]'\r\n```\r\n- Folks using Groovy operators on heterogeneous data very much like `NumberAwareComparator` but in some data science scenarios with homogeneous data, folks didn't want the performance hit. That's why I asked for those methods to be added. But I note that while we previously added that capability for `intersect` and `minus` we don't currently have it for `plus` (though we probably should).\r\n- There have also been numerous discussions on commutativity in the past. We don't expect commutativity for normal method calls, e.g. `List#add(String)` isn't the same as `String#add(List)` but for operators there is a higher expectation that commutativity will hold. But even for mathematical operators, minus isn't commutative for instance. So, while it has been a desirable feature for operators, we haven't had a strict requirement to always support commutativity. Do a search on \"commutativity\" on markmail (or elsewhere) and you will see numerous discussions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1637221541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1640313309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1915#issuecomment-1640313309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1915","id":1640313309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5hxTHd","user":{"login":"merscwog","id":760761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/760761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog","html_url":"https://github.com/merscwog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-18T14:15:38Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T14:15:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Before I make any additional modifications, it seem there are essentially 4 options to choose from at the moment:\r\n\r\n1. Do not add these operators at all.\r\n2. Revert the secondary argument to Set.\r\n3. Keep the secondary argument as Iterable.\r\n4. Update to include Iterable, List, and Collection types as a first argument for the '|', '&', and '^' operators.\r\n\r\nFor options 2-4, adjusting the location of the new operators within DGM to satisfy desired conventions should be assumed -- I had originally placed all the new methods grouped together, as that's how I interpreted the existing grouping pattern.\r\n\r\nOption [1] is basically what will happen if there is no consensus between 2-4 :-)\r\n\r\nOption [2] has the advantage that it is self contained for the type that the operators are mathematically defined for, Sets.  The disadvantage, is that it requires a Set type for each argument -- kind of like BitSet and Boolean (and even Number) have for their '|', '&', and '^' operators.\r\n\r\nOption [3] makes it easier to utilize other Iterable types without having to coerce them into a Set first to utilize the operators, but as noted, that could surprise a developer since they would receive a compilation error attempting to invert the call for a non-Set type as the first argument.\r\n\r\nOption [4] would require adding Iterable, List and Collection first arguments to bring into close parity with the coverage of the existing intersect() method.  This would define the operators over all of the collections, assuming that actually makes sense.  Union and plus are generally treated equivalent for Sets (assuming no custom comparator -- meaning equality is same as internal Set equals() logic -- maybe this is why plus() doesn't take a custom comparator?) But for non-Sets the behavior of dealing with duplicates would need to be defined.\r\n\r\nNow I'm also starting to believe that a dedicated union() operator for Sets is necessary, at least to get the xor() logic correct, since there is a custom NumberAwareComparator involved with intersection and minus -- and no matter which way xor() is composed from the other primitives, it needs to utilize a union() operation.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that plus() and union() should be considered the same thing for non-Set types, as plus should just blindly add things to the collection, and union() should \"ensure\" that the result doesn't contain unnecessary duplicates -- which is hard to define for non-sets.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to lean towards option [2] with an explicit union() method being added with a default NumberAwareComparator() utilized to determine whether something should be added to the resulting Set (where it will choose the value from the first set when there are duplicates)\r\n\r\nNOTE:  This will _NOT_ guarantee true commutativity because consider [\"A\", \"b\", \"C\"]  as Set unioned with [\"a\", \"B\", \"d\"] as Set with a case-insensitive comparator:\r\nThe result will be [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"d\"] or [\"a\", \"B\", \"C\", \"d\"] depending upon which was used first.  Based upon the custom comparator, they technically are equivalent, but for future uses with a different custom comparator, they would not be.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1640313309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1641892764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1915#issuecomment-1641892764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1915","id":1641892764,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5h3Uuc","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T11:15:08Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T11:15:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think option 3 aligns best with existing functionality.

It makes most sense with how the DGM methods and the Java APIs are designed. I agree that non-symmetry can potentially lead to confusion but I don't see that applies here.\r\n\r\nIf we have explained that \"union\" is like a Set-specific \"plus\", then I don't see why folks might expect it to work for Collections.\r\nIf I have `Set<String> wordsSeen` and `List<String> nextSentence`, then doing `wordsSeen |= nextSentence` makes perfect sense just like we currently would allow `wordsSeen += nextSentence`. Folks dealing with large datasets aren't going to want the extra time or memory hit of creating the superfluous set. I don't see folks suddenly expecting `nextSentence |= wordsSeen` to be available when we have explained this as a set operation.\r\n\r\nOr, to say it a different way, Set already has `containsAll(Collection)`, `addAll(Collection)`,` retainAll(Collection)`, `removeAll(Collection)`, as well as the Collection constructor, e.g. in HashSet. I see no problem with having `union(Collection)` or in our case we'd have `union(Iterable)` and `or(Iterable)` as an alias. We already have `minus(Iterable)`, `plus(Iterable)`, and `intersect(Iterable)`.\r\n\r\nMuch like we know that subtraction, power, division aren't symmetric and the order of the parameters is intrinsic to the problem domain, I see it that for the set-specific operators, the order is important and the iterable can be the second argument and have a different type to the first. Operations with a custom comparator aren't going to be symmetric behavior-wise in general, I don't see it as a given that set operations must be symmetric type-wise.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1644012383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1645571858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1915#issuecomment-1645571858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1915","id":1645571858,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5iFW8S","user":{"login":"merscwog","id":760761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/760761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog","html_url":"https://github.com/merscwog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T13:17:25Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T13:17:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm sure this will not satisfy everyone, but what if I did:\r\n- intersect() already exists, so tie that to '&' for all the same types (alias essentially, although just for non-comparator, since the long-form alias would always be available)\r\n- create a union() operator for all types, and tie it to '|' for those same types (very similar behavior to existing intersect() operator -- so it attempts to preserve original collection orders, but does not insert duplicates based upon the comparator into resulting collection)\r\n- create a symmetricDiff() operator for all types and tie it to '^' (using minus and union operators, although I believe with the two minuses all comparator-specific behavior for the union might be unnecessary and a simple plus could suffice -- I haven't 100% convinced myself this is true always, but I'm hoping that it is)\r\n  -  union(minus(a,b,comparator), minus(b,a,comparator), comparator) => plus(minus(a,b,comparator), minus(b,a,comparator))\r\n\r\naliased '&', '|', '^' would only be for the non-comparator variants of the operators.

You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1652815565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1656888257","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1922#issuecomment-1656888257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1922","id":1656888257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5iwhvB","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-29T20:56:03Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T20:56:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1656888257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1657301906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1915#issuecomment-1657301906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1915","id":1657301906,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5iyGuS","user":{"login":"merscwog","id":760761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/760761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog","html_url":"https://github.com/merscwog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-31T00:04:39Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T00:04:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In trying to implement and run various symmetric difference tests, I discovered what might be considered a bug in the minus() method.

Also, as you have indicated, `assertNotEquals` typically provides more informative failure messages, as it can include details about the expected and actual values if the assertion fails, making it easier to diagnose and fix the issue. The implementation of `assertNotEquals` is also designed to handle a variety of data types, as its implementation typically includes type checks and appropriate comparison logic to determine if the values or objects are unequal, regardless of their types, unlike `assertFalse`, which typically relies on the `equals()` method of the objects being compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1690787511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1691015590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1936#issuecomment-1691015590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1936","id":1691015590,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5kytmm","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-24T05:15:33Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T05:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1691015590/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1691160344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1936#issuecomment-1691160344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1936","id":1691160344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5kzQ8Y","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-24T07:33:25Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T07:33:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Taher-Ghaleb \r\nassertNotEquals may improve readability a bit. I think that does not apply to me so much, but I can imagine others think differently. So I agree in that point. \r\nAs for the failure message... the assertFalse may have a failure message only because it is otherwise quite a bad message in the reporting that something was true and should have been false. But then it would be consequent to check if the failure message can be remove when transforming from assertFalse to assertNotEquals. Just a suggestion. I don't know if you guys use a tool for this, or do that by hand. If it would be a tool only, like a simple refactoring, it can of course not tell if the error message in the assertFalse is still required. I did not look in detail for the PR, But I think in all cases it could have been removed. Just as a point to think about.\r\nThen there is one point I do not agree with you and that is what you wrote about the implementation of assertNotEquals. It has a signature that takes Object for the object to check. That means there is no static type information and compiler failure that prevents me using a String and an Integer. And if you look in the PR, there are equal checks on String and GString, which are not closely related in the java world. There is a equal check on ArrayList and Range. Which might be closer, but still Rang is not a ArrayList. assertNotEquals as used here does only 2 things, checking for null and maybe  null==null, otherwise it will only call equals. So yes, there is the null check that could help, but I am usually very picky when it comes to null. I prefer testing that state explicitly if expected or not expected. That kind of negates the usefulness of that one additional step in assertNotEquals for me. Others may see it different.\r\n\r\nAnyway... I wrote this only to give you thoughts for your research... actually one more thought. In case of Groovy power asserts are almost always a good choice: \"assert string == gstring\".

Is there a statement about property support -- I assume now \"def foo\" is a `static final` constant -- or any other differences from the Groovy 4 trait solution?\r\n\r\nRegarding `InterfaceName.this.method()`, is that an issue of the method indexing or the access restriction or the `invokeinterface` instruction?
