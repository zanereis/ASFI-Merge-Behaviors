If so, it should not run unless the functionality is actually enabled (is this the case?).\r\n2) There are various listeners attached to global objects (Preferences, at least), which can lead to memory leaks. There are some (I think) incorrect attempts to use weak listeners. This would need to be reworked, ideally by removing listeners explicitly, at the right time, rather than relying on weak listeners. Weak listeners can be used, but then it needs to be very clear when the objects are really going to be garbage collected, and why they won't be garbage collected immediately.\r\n3) This patch uses an internationalization library (omegat) that is not standard in the NetBeans codebase. It would be preferable to do internationalization in the same way as other modules.\r\n4) This is a very big patch for relatively simple functionality; I think a lot of auto-generated files were included. Those should be removed and put in a .gitignore. (Or maybe they will go away if suggestion (3) is implemented.)\r\n\r\nAlso, would you be able to post a screenshot of the AutoSavePanel in the settings pane? Makes it easier to review the UI without building the patch ourselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/629856344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/629858869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2119#issuecomment-629858869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2119","id":629858869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTg1ODg2OQ==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-17T20:52:02Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T20:52:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, I agree with @eirikbakke on every point, though as of the donation even the translated files have some value.

I leadered the open source translation effort years ago before Sun cut us off for a paid company\r\n\r\nOh--was that the translation effort for all of NetBeans? That's awesome!\r\n\r\nManual translations we would definitively want to preserve.\r\n\r\nComments on the settings UI:\r\n* In the English translation, perhaps better to use the term \"autosave\" instead of \"save automatically\". It's a well-established word for this kind of functionality (and it also takes up less space in the tab).\r\n* I now discovered that NetBeans has a \"reformat on save\" option. How does this interact with the autosave function?\r\n* To save a tab in the Options dialog, it might be good to merge the contents of the \"On Save\" and \"Save Automatically\" tabs. Just have a single tab called \"Saving\", and one heading called \"Format on Save\" and another one called \"Autosave\".\r\n* How does the \"save on focus\" feature interact with \"save files every X minutes\"? If \"Save files when focus is lost\" is checked, are files _also_ saved every X minutes?

Remove the menu/toolbar action at all;\r\n. Change the Options to what it was originally.\r\n\r\nBoth changes are quick and I will be glad to do as we decide.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/633305393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/633305617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2119#issuecomment-633305617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2119","id":633305617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzMwNTYxNw==","user":{"login":"mgraciano","id":348661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODY2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/348661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano","html_url":"https://github.com/mgraciano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgraciano/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-24T21:46:56Z","updated_at":"2020-05-24T21:46:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I only had a quick look at this, but this is my reply: The code looks ok to merge, as long as the statements are true.
