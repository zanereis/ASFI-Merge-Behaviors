is a good thing to bring up on dev@beam.apache.org so that the whole community can be part of the conversation. I'm sure everyone will be interested in how you use the `Sink` design pattern.\r\n\r\nI will give a quick answer right here: `Write.to(Sink)` was never a primitive but just a design pattern. The design pattern did not work correctly with unbounded data, windowing, or triggers. We found many connectors where it just wasn't the right design anyhow. And when it _was_ used, most of its capabilities were left blank most of the time. So we decided to inline it and do only the parts needed for different IO connectors.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation now is to build the composite transform directly. You may notice that most of the IO connectors in the Beam codebase never used `Sink`, because it just was not helpful. There is a longer IO authoring guide at https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/authoring-overview/, which still needs update for this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/297467301/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/297467535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2519#issuecomment-297467535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2519","id":297467535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzQ2NzUzNQ==","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T16:30:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T16:30:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see.
