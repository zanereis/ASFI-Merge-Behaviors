think there is a conceptual issue with this fix and with the original JIRA. The datatype of the dynamic parameter is fixed by the compiler at compile time, so it cannot depend on an expression supplied at run time. There are mechanisms at the CLI level that allow run time manipulation; it may be that ODBC/JDBC allow access to those. (Trafci does not.) But those are limited to changing the datatype only; they do not involve lexical analysis or parsing of the expression. Indeed, given a string 'ABCD' in an EXECUTE USING statement, trafci automatically converts from the character set of the SQL statement to the character set of the column, making the N'xxxx' and _iso88591'xxxx' syntaxes unnecessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/401949681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/401949912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1623#issuecomment-401949912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1623","id":401949912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTk0OTkxMg==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-02T21:55:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T21:55:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Following up on that remark: Perhaps the best way to resolve this particular JIRA is with a documentation change.
