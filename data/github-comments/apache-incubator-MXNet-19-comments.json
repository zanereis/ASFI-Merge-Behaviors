For example, in sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], if input 1, also from previous information stored in `c`(cell state) and `h`(hidden state, also output), you get an ideal output 2.  \n\nFor organization of `X_train_batch`, let's take an example. \nAssume now you have a sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].  And, we have `batch_size` == 2 and `seq_len` == 3. \nSo first `drop_tail`, you will got \n\n```\n1 6\n2 7 \n3 8 \n4 9\n5 10\n```\n\n(drop 11 in the sequence.)\n\nNotice 1 and 5 forms a batch, and 2 and 6 is the label for this batch. (You can deduce the same for batch (2,6) (3,7) ...) \n\nThen the batch is truncated to fit the `seq_len`, e.g. 3. So the final `X_train_batch` is \n\n```\n1 6\n2 7\n3 8\n```\n\nEvery line forms a batch and the next line is the label to the batch. You might also be curious about the behavior of last line, i.e. What's the label of last line?

caveat on NDArray ops which we need want to think a bit careful about when support them.\n\n# Blocking in Operator\n\n```\ndef forward(self, src_nd):\n    src_nd = src_nd + 1\n    data = src_nd.asnumpy()\n```\n\nHere data calls `src_nd.asnumpy()`, which is an blocking operation. The plus operation will be dispatched to another worker thread when constraints are satisfied. If there is only one worker thread on say GPU, then this can cause a deadlock, as current thread(which is worker) wait for the plus operation to be completed, however, the plus operation is supposed to be executed by the worker thread.  \n\nIdeally, all operations in the operator definition should be executed by the same thread in serial manner, which makes it unit ops to be executed, this was not the case here.\n\n# Which NDArray to Expose\n\nThere are two ways of NDArrays that can be exposed, either expose the original NDArray that stores the data and result. Or, rewrap the pointer in the TBlob as a new NDArray. Currently the second way requires no changes in interface. Both have some things need to think about.\n\nThe semantics of engine means when we call the forward/backward function, the original NDArray is marked as reading and writing, and the state won't change until the `on_complete` callback is invoked.\n\nTo wrap another NDArray, we only need to make sure that when we get the result, we need to call `on_complete`, this can be achieved by an dummy engine call\n\n``` c++\nEngine::Get()->push(reads={result_nd}, [on_compelte] () {\n    on_complete();\n})\n```\n\nThis operation will be scheduled when `result_nd` is available, which in turn notifies the completion of this op.\n\n# Notification of Finish of Async Copy\n\n```\ndef forward(self, src_nd, res_nd):\n    src_nd = src_nd + 1\n    src_nd.copyto(res_nd)\n```\n\nWhen the copyto returns, the copy operation did not necessarily finish. We need some way to notify the finish, like what was mentioned in last paragraph.\n\n# Summary\n\nPutting async calls in an async call have some interesting problems we might want to think about, because current NDArray interface is async, these problems need to be thought about when implementing them. I think we can first go with the NativeOp as first phase, and supporting nd as second phase.\n\nAlso cc @hotpxl , can you also think about this to see if there is any possible issue on engine side?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/158680454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/158680609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/459#issuecomment-158680609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/459","id":158680609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODY4MDYwOQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T21:05:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T21:05:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@thirdwing

Unfortunately, there seem to be no enough document or example on this. Please refer to [this code](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/io.py#L98). Basically, you can pass a list of data / labels, or actually a dictionary of name-array pairs to construct your data iterators. Something like\n\n``` python\niter = mx.NDArrayIter({'data1': nd_data1, 'data2': nd_data2}, {'label1': nd_label1, 'label2': nd_label2})\n```\n\nThe names `data1`, `label1` etc. should match the name you used to construct the network. e.g.\n\n``` python\nd1 = mx.sym.Variable('data1')\nfc1 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=d1,
