looking at the EventListener interface, I'm not quite sure it'd be able to accomplish what we'd need by it self.  Specifically, this line from the documentation makes me a bit uneasy:\r\n\r\n> All event methods must execute fast, without external locking, cannot throw exceptions, attempt to mutate the event parameters, or be reentrant back into the client.\r\n\r\nThe inability for a listener to modify the client being the phrase to note there.  Maybe an EventListener in conjunction with a queue handling mechanism in front of OkHttp would work but that sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through and equally as many places for something to go wrong.\r\n\r\n@swankjesse, what would the benefit of putting a queue in front of OkHttp be (aside from what I mentioned above)?  Would querying the Dispatcher directly be inappropriate in some way or are you just suggesting that an extra abstraction might lead to a cleaner implementation?\r\n\r\n@adriancole, the StorageComponent code is a bit deep and I haven't managed to get through it all yet, particularly to the ES client, but for reference, there was another situation where we hit an OOM: when one of our ES nodes went down.  I wasn't able to identify and exact order of events that caused the issue but for some reason after the node (1 out of 3 of them) went offline we had a backup of requests and spiked to an OOM.  That indicates to me that I'm guessing the server was not failing nicely and triggering the backoff strategy you mentioned.  Again, not sure what other factors were at play but it's another scenario to consider at the very least.\r\n\r\nAs for the simplification: that sounds ideal to me as long as proper metrics are maintained with respect to number of spans dropped ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/335266783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/335327798","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1760#issuecomment-335327798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1760","id":335327798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTMyNzc5OA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T00:49:59Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T00:49:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Honestly, I think we should start with dropping on backlog and go from\nthere.

This solution does require some additional infrastructure setup, but by no means it would double the infrastructure.

As @goller said we are working hard on making it more efficient for this kind of data, plus we are not very java-oriented people. That's why we are using both. It probably creates a bit of confusion and we are sorry about this.

For example, I suspect\nthe schema of \"zipkin\" in your telegraph plugin is now v1 format, which is\nunfortunate as it is likely more complex than needed and would introduce\ncomplexity to migrate if ever to v2. If in hindsight asked for help, I\ncould have helped you with the java part so that the schema could be\nsimple.

Or the migration path from zipkin1 to\n> zipkin2 is more complicated?\n>\nthe main thing is that the schema used in telegraf is v2 (it is simpler to\ndesign it this way and simpler for long-term). For example, we convert v1\nto v2 format so that queries on data are always in v2. User apps don't need\nto change. So basically, yeah I'd restart the effort in v2 format.

These aspects can be implemented in the agent instead. The sampling decision though should be taken in the library.\r\n\r\nWe should also think about compatibility between tracing library version and the agent because there will scenarios where the agent is not updated but the client library is and so on. This also means that we should avoid tight coupling between them.\r\n\r\nWe should probably start listing out what we want to implement in the library and the agent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/342393561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/342394464","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1778#issuecomment-342394464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1778","id":342394464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjM5NDQ2NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-07T07:08:08Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T07:08:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FWIW I don't expect everyone to be able to use an agent, so almost\ncertainly js will continue to have its own library-focused post mechanisms.\nIn zipkin-js this is already implemented albeit not as advanced as java\n(already does http batching and compression is actually quite simple)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/342394464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/342394763","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1778#issuecomment-342394763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1778","id":342394763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjM5NDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-07T07:09:49Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T07:09:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"for example, browsers and native apps won't be able to use an agent,\nneither will android (java) or most clients..
