Now, much clear.\r\nHowever, that will get the wrong route result, IMO. \r\nSuppose the sharding algorithm is mod(2) for `sharding key`, then `A` DB is for records with even sharding key, and `B` DB is for those with odd sharding key.\r\n\r\nLet's take `set shardingKey= 1 where id = 0`  for example.\r\nThere may be a record whose id =0 and shardingKey = 0 (See, target stored in `A` DB). If we use`shardingKey= 1` for routing, this SQL will be routed to `B` DB. As a result, no record is updated.\r\n\r\nWhat's more,`ShardingUpdateStatementValidator` tells us that updating `sharding-key` is not permitted.\r\n\r\nI am not sure my explanation is what you expected.

How could an added` SQL case` solve your issue?\r\n\r\nHi @tristaZero , I was running DCL integration test these days, it blocked by this issue, since `postgresql.password` was changed by test case, then the later jdbc connection could not be created, and integration test broken.\r\n\r\nRelated env.properties configurations:\r\n```\r\npostgresql.host=127.0.0.1\r\npostgresql.port=5432\r\npostgresql.username=postgres\r\npostgresql.password=test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test case is: `<dcl-test-case sql=\"ALTER USER CURRENT_USER WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password'\" db-types=\"PostgreSQL\"/>`.\r\n\r\nI think it could be removed, this situation could be tested by: `<dcl-test-case sql=\"ALTER USER user_dev WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password'\" db-types=\"PostgreSQL\"/>`.\r\n\r\n`ALTER PASSWORD` could be verified with psql on command line:\r\n- run `psql -U postgres`, enter original password, e.g. `test`\r\n- run `ALTER USER CURRENT_USER WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password'`\r\n- run `\\q`\r\n- run `psql -U postgres`, password should be `password` now\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/677197429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/677222115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6938#issuecomment-677222115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6938","id":677222115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzIyMjExNQ==","user":{"login":"jingshanglu","id":16559542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU5NTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16559542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu","html_url":"https://github.com/jingshanglu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingshanglu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T05:58:03Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T05:58:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhaopinglu This involves the definition of statement, and  is being discussed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/677222115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/677252878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6948#issuecomment-677252878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6948","id":677252878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzI1Mjg3OA==","user":{"login":"jacksparrow414","id":33389378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzg5Mzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33389378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414","html_url":"https://github.com/jacksparrow414","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacksparrow414/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T06:12:41Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T06:12:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RafaelGuo could you show more details ?

new `user` or `role`?\r\n\r\nHi @tristaZero , I've had a look at `dcl-integrate-test-cases.xml` and `authority.xml`.\r\n- MySQL has no alter current login user's password test case\r\n- It's better to test with new user. `user_dev` in `<dcl-test-case sql=\"ALTER USER user_dev WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password'\" db-types=\"PostgreSQL\"/>` is a new user defined in `authority.xml`: `<sql>CREATE USER user_dev PASSWORD 'passwd_dev'</sql>`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/677610819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/677622531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6454#issuecomment-677622531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6454","id":677622531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzYyMjUzMQ==","user":{"login":"Vantza","id":11496927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk2OTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11496927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza","html_url":"https://github.com/Vantza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Vantza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T12:16:39Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T12:16:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"same

If I miss something, welcome your comment.\r\n\r\nActually, the main aim of `Apache ShardingSphere` is to make the traditional DBMS like `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `Oracle`, `SQLServer` has the scalability or turn them to `distributed databases`.\r\nBase on that, my answer is `NO`. Here is my explanation.\r\n\r\n1. SQL. I presume that traditional SQLs do not apply to `OrbitDB`or `GunDB`, right?  But SQL is the communication language between clients and ShardingSphere.\r\n2. Programing language or protocol. There are two products of `ShardingSphere` for you to choose. `ShardingProxy` is like an enhanced `MySQL` or `PostgreSQL` server, then the binary proposal is used for visiting. On the other hand, `ShardingJDBC` is a lightweight JAVA framework, hence JAVA language is required.\r\n3. I can not catch your thought. AFAIK, `Decentralised Databases` have the scalability or `distributed storage` already, so users do not need to care about `storage capacity` or `query efficiency`. So why do you want to use `ShardingSphere` for `Decentralised Databases`?

As you have mentioned that only SQL is supported in the ShardingSphere, it may not be possible to apply for `OrbitDB` and `GunDB`. \r\n\r\nYou are right in the view that there are a lot of scalability features in some of these distributed databases interms of `query efficiency` and `storage capability`. However there are some challenges in terms of meeting an optimum level of data consistency while they are used for `distributed data synchronisation` in a `replicated state machine` setting.
