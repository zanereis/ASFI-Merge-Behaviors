IMHO we can also save a lot of redundant fires by this way and I think lots of existing rules can work well with this fashion.\r\n\r\nI agree in general this is the right direction. Not only the rule should allow specific convention for matching, but also able to create new rels with given conventions. For example, today when we fire ProjectMerge, it will generate another LogicalProject even if two EmmuerableProjects are merged. This doesn't make sense. But in order to do that we should provide a way to register RelFactory into the framework for custom convention.

@zabetak for the pointer. After reviewing the whole thread, I now understand why @vlsi believes this is dup of 2223. \r\n\r\nI think \"single convention\" and \"convention preserving\" rules are the concepts that capture exactly what we need.\r\n\r\nFor \"single convention\", although user can specify operand class, some rules today don't have extension points, e.g. ProjectMergeRule. Anyone who would want to update those rule to only match a given convention would have to copy and rewrite the whole rule. Or at least sub-class the existing rules.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's no way to support \"convention preserving\" as the actual convention needs to be defined when defining the rule.\r\n\r\nPersonally I agree with @vlsi that this is one outstanding missing piece of Calcite which affects planning performance quite a bit. Most of the Calcite users would just use the default rule set, and expect them to work out of the box. It would be too much to ask them to rewrite or even sub-class the rules.  \r\n\r\nMy patch here provides a temporary solution to address the most pressing need - those rules I updated do get fired a lot in practice. But if we can reach a conclusion on 2223 (looks like we are very close), this patch won't be needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/561899807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/561899978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1313#issuecomment-561899978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1313","id":561899978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTg5OTk3OA==","user":{"login":"asereda-gs","id":25229979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI5OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25229979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs","html_url":"https://github.com/asereda-gs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asereda-gs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T23:56:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T23:56:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@durpersi
