the culprit is ModuleManager:2199. I've consulted that with @jtulach and we come to conclusion that the Package dependency was originally meant as a test for system package. Otherwise it would require, at the point of this getProblems() test, to bring up classloaders for the entire subtree rooted at the tested module: this is both barely possible (as dependencies are not deep-discovered yet, entire `simulateEnable` uses depth-first traversal, and terrible performance.\r\n\r\nIf the check is disabled at this point (as it was earlier), module system might accept a module (which will be later rejected for missing required package) - and will load *all its dependencies*. While the broken module will not load in the final stage, all its dependencies will, recursively, even though they are not needed in the system. Those dependencies may register services, `-Provides` declarations etc, further polluting the module system.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NB prints an error on startup that a module cannot be enabled bcs. of missing dependency). \r\n\r\nI'd say that the semantics for `OpenIDE-Module-Package-Dependency` is broken - a failed *eager* module would report the module as an error, although eagers should not load at all, if (some) of their requirements are not met - and should not report anything.\r\n\r\nI'd say that the usage in `javafx` is not correct since it relies on chicken-or-egg problem:\r\n- only load an eager module iff its requirements are met\r\n- detect a package (class) in module that such eager moule brings to the system, IN CASE it is enabled\r\n\r\n(edited: the recovery sort of works, so the IDE starts even with multiple such broken modules)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1572030019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1572031730","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5790#issuecomment-1572031730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5790","id":1572031730,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ds0zy","user":{"login":"Max84","id":6622400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjI0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6622400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84","html_url":"https://github.com/Max84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-01T13:13:04Z","updated_at":"2023-06-01T13:13:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@KacerCZ

I don't think we'd see a merging of these two concepts accepted.  I do think that some of the logical views could be enhanced somewhat so that use of the file tab is less necessary (eg. with Maven, showing readme, etc; accessing resource, assembly descriptors, and other locations even when the locations _don't_ exist on disk).  I would suggest considering what you think is missing in the project tab view, and take it from there.\n> \n> > In addition, in Netbeans18, many shortcut keys in the shortcut key search are not

merged or not, the fundamental thing is that we want Netbeans to be more powerful, more convenient and better in terms of file display and manipulation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1584305863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1584883566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5969#issuecomment-1584883566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5969","id":1584883566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ed2du","user":{"login":"asbachb","id":1482768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb","html_url":"https://github.com/asbachb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-09T16:52:59Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T16:52:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Contributed
