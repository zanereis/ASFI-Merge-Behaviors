And after analyzing the code below and validating it online, we found that some Exceptions are catched during HoodieMergeHandle#writeRecord, then the writing handle process is interrupted, and only marked as failures in WriteStatus, therefore causes data loss from delta logs to data files. The exceptions might be like IOException from HoodieFileWriter#writeToFile, HoodieUpsertException, and so on.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  protected boolean writeRecord(HoodieRecord<T> hoodieRecord, Option<IndexedRecord> indexedRecord, boolean isDelete) {\r\n    Option recordMetadata = hoodieRecord.getData().getMetadata();\r\n    if (!partitionPath.equals(hoodieRecord.getPartitionPath())) {\r\n      HoodieUpsertException failureEx = new HoodieUpsertException(\"mismatched partition path, record partition: \"\r\n          + hoodieRecord.getPartitionPath() + \" but trying to insert into partition: \" + partitionPath);\r\n      writeStatus.markFailure(hoodieRecord, failureEx, recordMetadata);\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    try {\r\n      if (indexedRecord.isPresent() && !isDelete) {\r\n        writeToFile(hoodieRecord.getKey(), (GenericRecord) indexedRecord.get(), preserveMetadata && useWriterSchemaForCompaction);\r\n        recordsWritten++;\r\n      } else {\r\n        recordsDeleted++;\r\n      }\r\n      writeStatus.markSuccess(hoodieRecord, recordMetadata);\r\n      // deflate record payload after recording success. This will help users access payload as a\r\n      // part of marking\r\n      // record successful.\r\n      hoodieRecord.deflate();\r\n      return true;\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n      LOG.error(\"Error writing record  \" + hoodieRecord, e);\r\n      writeStatus.markFailure(hoodieRecord, e, recordMetadata);\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n> And what would you want to do when you encounter that ?\r\n\r\nWhat we want to do has been detailedly described in the opening part as a) -> d). \r\n\r\nCompaction completed commit will actually be regarded as the snapshot and affect the latest file slices, so it's better to take the writestatus errors under consideration when deciding to commit or rollback for compaction (Just as the StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator done for deltacommit showed below). \r\n\r\nIn a word, compaction commit with errors should be rolled back, warned and retried for next schedule if we think data quality is more important than job stablility.\r\n\r\norg.apache.hudi.sink.StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator#doCommit\r\n```java\r\n  private void doCommit(String instant, List<WriteStatus> writeResults) {\r\n    // commit or rollback\r\n    long totalErrorRecords = writeResults.stream().map(WriteStatus::getTotalErrorRecords).reduce(Long::sum).orElse(0L);\r\n    long totalRecords = writeResults.stream().map(WriteStatus::getTotalRecords).reduce(Long::sum).orElse(0L);\r\n    boolean hasErrors = totalErrorRecords > 0;\r\n\r\n    if (!hasErrors || this.conf.getBoolean(FlinkOptions.IGNORE_FAILED)) {\r\n      HashMap<String, String> checkpointCommitMetadata = new HashMap<>();\r\n      if (hasErrors) {\r\n        LOG.warn(\"Some records failed to merge but forcing commit since commitOnErrors set to true. Errors/Total=\"\r\n            + totalErrorRecords + \"/\" + totalRecords);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      final Map<String, List<String>> partitionToReplacedFileIds = tableState.isOverwrite\r\n          ? writeClient.getPartitionToReplacedFileIds(tableState.operationType, writeResults)\r\n          : Collections.emptyMap();\r\n      boolean success = writeClient.commit(instant, writeResults, Option.of(checkpointCommitMetadata),\r\n          tableState.commitAction, partitionToReplacedFileIds);\r\n      if (success) {\r\n        reset();\r\n        this.ckpMetadata.commitInstant(instant);\r\n        LOG.info(\"Commit instant [{}] success!\", instant);\r\n      } else {\r\n        throw new HoodieException(String.format(\"Commit instant [%s] failed!\", instant));\r\n      }\r\n    } else {\r\n      LOG.error(\"Error when writing. Errors/Total=\" + totalErrorRecords + \"/\" + totalRecords);\r\n      LOG.error(\"The first 100 error messages\");\r\n      writeResults.stream().filter(WriteStatus::hasErrors).limit(100).forEach(ws -> {\r\n        LOG.error(\"Global error for partition path {} and fileID {}: {}\",\r\n            ws.getGlobalError(), ws.getPartitionPath(), ws.getFileId());\r\n        if (ws.getErrors().size() > 0) {\r\n          ws.getErrors().forEach((key, value) -> LOG.trace(\"Error for key:\" + key + \" and value \" + value));\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n      // Rolls back instant\r\n      writeClient.rollback(instant);\r\n      throw new HoodieException(String.format(\"Commit instant [%s] failed and rolled back !\", instant));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we suggest to use FlinkOptions#IGNORE_FAILED for both delta_commit's and compaction commit's  commitOrRollback policy. Otherwise, we will still unexpectedly encounter data loss even though FlinkOptions#IGNORE_FAILED set false.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1207662818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1207679679","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6321#issuecomment-1207679679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6321","id":1207679679,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5H-7q_","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-08T05:22:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T05:22:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gtwuser could you provide the Hudi configs you used?

The prior wildcard pattern is not meant to be used for a subset of partitions in a Hudi table. Instead of globbing selective paths, you can still load the Hudi table with the base path and use .filter with the partition values so Spark does the partition pruning without scanning the whole table\r\n\r\n@yihua  I was not able to reproduce this behavior at all in our data lake tables. Our tables are partitioned by `year/month/day/hour`. When running the following query, Hudi first lists every file in the entire table for metadata  (which is huge so it never finishes). The only way I was able to run a query that prunes partitions in Hudi 0.10.1 was to do the following (pyspark):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nread_paths = [\r\n    f\"{datalake_url}/year=2022/month=7/*/*\",\r\n]\r\n\r\nhudi_opts = {\r\n    \"hoodie.datasource.query.type\": \"snapshot\",\r\n    \"hoodie.file.index.enable\": False,\r\n    \"hoodie.datasource.read.paths\": \",\".join(read_paths)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndf = (\r\n    spark.read \r\n        .format(\"hudi\") \r\n        .options(**hudi_opts)\r\n        .load() \r\n)\r\n\r\ndf.count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resulted in only loading the partitions for `year=2022` and `month=7`. \r\n\r\nIn Hudi version `0.9.x` we were able to use hive-style partition glob paths but this went away in `0.10.x` due to changes with glob path parsing: `f\"{datalake_url}/year=2022/month=7/day=*/hour=*\"`\r\n\r\n@kartik18 Could you try a couple things to confirm this behavior for you as well?\r\n\r\n## Load DF with file index disabled\r\n\r\n```python\r\nread_paths = [\r\n    f\"{datalake_url}/cluster=abc/*\",\r\n    f\"{datalake_url}/cluster=def/*\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nhudi_opts = {\r\n    \"hoodie.datasource.query.type\": \"snapshot\",\r\n    \"hoodie.file.index.enable\": False,\r\n    \"hoodie.datasource.read.paths\": \",\".join(read_paths)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndf = (\r\n    spark.read \r\n        .format(\"hudi\") \r\n        .options(**hudi_opts)\r\n        .load() \r\n)\r\n\r\ndf.count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Load DF with file index enabled\r\n\r\n```python\r\nread_paths = [\r\n    f\"{datalake_url}/cluster=abc/*\",\r\n    f\"{datalake_url}/cluster=def/*\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nhudi_opts = {\r\n    \"hoodie.datasource.query.type\": \"snapshot\",\r\n    \"hoodie.datasource.read.paths\": \",\".join(read_paths)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndf = (\r\n    spark.read \r\n        .format(\"hudi\") \r\n        .options(**hudi_opts)\r\n        .load() \r\n)\r\n\r\ndf.count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n__NOTE:__ I am using spark 3 which is different than @kartik18 who is using spark 2 but I don't think this behavior is tied to a specific spark version (Hudi behavior).

> If the end commit is active and is used as the filtering instant for scan, shouldn't `getLatestFileSliceBeforeOrOn` work here ?\r\n> \r\n> yes, it works, but it can't handle the condition when end commit is archived, if we use `getLatestFileSliceBeforeOrOn`, it may be a savepoint or just no fileSlice(be cleaned), thus not right, `getLatestFileSliceAfterOrOn` can hande it.\r\n> \r\n> if the end commit is active, `getLatestFileSliceAfterOrOn` may get the right fileSlice or the next fileSlice.\r\n> \r\n> if `getLatestFileSliceAfterOrOn` not found a fileSlice, we must then search before/reverse, as it may have a fileSlice before which is in the incremental query range(it must be the latest fileSlice in this fileGroup), we should judge if this fileSlice is before the read.start-commit, if it is, we skip this fileSlice, otherwise we use this fileSlice to search. so why `getLatestFileSliceAfterOrOnThenBefore`\r\n\r\nIn general, let's not make things complex here, the only right way for multi-versioning is the timeline instant, one instant has its counterpart fs view, we should not dig into file slices for different version for one snapshot query even though there is performance gain.\r\n\r\nIf start/end commit are both archived, very probably they are cleaned also, we have 2 choices here\r\n1. read the save point commit if there is with greater timestamp\r\n2. read the latest commit\r\n\r\nIf start commit is archived but end commit is active, there is also possibility that the active instants with smaller timestamp that end commit is cleaned, we should check that first before we use the end commit as the fs view version filtering condition, that makes the thing more complex too.\r\n\r\nSo, i would -1 if this is only an improvement not a bug fix.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1208843496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1208862487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5885#issuecomment-1208862487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5885","id":1208862487,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5IDccX","user":{"login":"YannByron","id":10036681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM2Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10036681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron","html_url":"https://github.com/YannByron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YannByron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-09T03:13:11Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T03:13:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot

read.start-commit, if it is, we skip this fileSlice, otherwise we use this fileSlice to search. so why `getLatestFileSliceAfterOrOnThenBefore`\r\n> \r\n> In general, let's not make things complex here, the only right way for multi-versioning is the timeline instant, one instant has its counterpart fs view, we should not dig into file slices for different version for one snapshot query even though there is performance gain.\r\n> \r\n> If start/end commit are both archived, very probably they are cleaned also, we have 2 choices here\r\n> \r\n> 1. read the save point commit if there is

end commit is cleaned, we should check that first before we use the end commit as the fs view version filtering condition, that makes the thing more complex too.\r\n> \r\n> So, i would -1 if this is only an improvement not a bug fix.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23452216/183617708-f3698152-424b-4cf0-b420-d0f724a2906e.png)\r\nIf we read the latest commit, then the upsert between read.end-commit and latest commit will shadow the insert \r\nbetweent read.start-commit and read.end-commit, thus incremental query lost the data, is this a bug or not?\r\n\r\nI draw a sketch above, suppose instant35 is a savepoint and we retain 40 commits for clean,above is the timeline\r\n1)if read.end-commit <= instant30, we can use instant35(savepoint) to do incremental query\r\n2)if instant30 < read.end-commit <= instant35, we use [slice35,slice58,slice35,slice30] to do query\r\n3)if instant35 < read.end-commit <= instant58, we can use instant60(the earliest uncleaned instant) to do query\r\n4)if instant58 < read.end-commit <= instant60, we use [slice60, slice61?, slice60, slice30] to do query\r\n5)if read.end-commit > instant60, we use the original `getLatestFileSliceBeforeOrOn` logic\r\n\r\nAs you said \"we should not dig into file slices for different version for one snapshot query\", I understand it as we should \r\nuse one instant's fs view(flieSlice combination), not recombine as 2) and 4)\r\n\r\nThen consider another solution, get the savepoint instant or earliest uncleaned instant just after the read.end-commit, then use\r\nthis instant as the parameter of `getLatestFileSliceBeforeOrOn`, the problem is how we can easliy get the  \r\nearliest uncleaned instant just after the read.end-commit, as we don't have a timeline which is dataActive?\r\n\r\nCan we just align the FirstNonSavepointActiveCommit to EarliestNonSavepointUncleanedCommit? Then will be simpler in many \r\nprocessing logic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1209155309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1209163723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6340#issuecomment-1209163723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6340","id":1209163723,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5IEl_L","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-09T09:51:45Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T09:51:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CI is green https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/apache-hudi-ci/_build/results?buildId=10694&view=results","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1209163723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1209179150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6345#issuecomment-1209179150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6345","id":1209179150,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5IEpwO","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-09T10:06:14Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T10:06:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will update the implementation section with more details once we decide on which approach to go forward with out of the two proposed ones.
