`template.status` is equal to `None`.\n\nThis comes from the `Template.list(...)` request just before, which has the following response (cf logs):\n\n```\n[\n  {\n   domain : u'ROOT',\n   domainid :

you can see, there's no \"status\" in this response.\nSo somehow, the issue is due to the fact that a `listTemplates` request returned a result without status during a template download.\n\nI cannot see how it can be related to this change. Moreover, I tested my pull request, and my tests included a template download and a VM deployment.\n\n@swill Is it possible that an error in the template download would cause the absence of the status field, and therefore this error?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219121751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219123470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1495#issuecomment-219123470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1495","id":219123470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTEyMzQ3MA==","user":{"login":"swill","id":13644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill","html_url":"https://github.com/swill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T18:29:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T18:29:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we should merge this one at this point.  @sverrirab my understanding is that once #1533 is merged, this will be required.

mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/v-215-VM.agent'/>\n<address type='virtio-serial'/>\n<target type='virtio' name='v-215-VM.vport'/>\n</channel>\n<channel type='unix'>\n<source mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/v-215-VM.org.qemu.guest_agent.0'/>\n<address type='virtio-serial'/>\n<target type='virtio' name='org.qemu.guest_agent.0'/>\n</channel>\n```\n\nThe commands afterwards:\n\n```\n[root@n04 ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command v-215-VM '{\"execute\":\"guest-ping\"}'\n{\"return\":{}}\n\n[root@n04 ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command v-215-VM '{\"execute\":\"guest-sync\", \"arguments\":{\"id\":1234}}'\n{\"return\":1234}\n\n[root@n04 ~]#\n```\n\nBy having the channels already in place it is later just a matter of updating libvirt-java and starting to use this communication channel.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219152627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/219154273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1518#issuecomment-219154273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1518","id":219154273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTE1NDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"serg38","id":16176702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc2NzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16176702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38","html_url":"https://github.com/serg38","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serg38/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-13T20:43:43Z","updated_at":"2016-05-13T20:43:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
