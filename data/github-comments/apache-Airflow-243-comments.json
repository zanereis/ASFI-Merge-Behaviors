I've created `tests/models/test_baseoperator.py` (this didn't exist to my surprise) because some logic from the TaskInstance moved to the BaseOperator. In addition, I added a test to verify if a Jinja environment is instantiated only once, even with multiple templated fields (`test_jinja_env_creation` in `tests/models/test_baseoperator.py`).\r\n\r\nI think a few bits and pieces could still improve (e.g. `render_template` could be a staticmethod, because it doesn't read anything directly from `self`, sets are currently not templatable), etc... but think we should also keep the PR as small as possible. With that idea, if all is okay logically, is this okay now? 🙂","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/517906672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/517934392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5461#issuecomment-517934392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5461","id":517934392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzkzNDM5Mg==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-03T15:49:13Z","updated_at":"2019-08-03T15:49:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yeah I think most of the tests that should be in test_baseoperator are currently in test_taskinstance or core.
