I believe a combination of priorities and optimistic locking would be a good way to go.\n\nAll kind of tasks get assigned some priority (hard coded), 0 being highest priority\nrealtime-ingestion: 0\nbatch-ingestion: 1\nmerge-task: 2\n(note that the priorities assigned is a matter of policy and can be changed independently of the algorithm suggested below)\n\nTasks implement following algorithm to do the work\n\n```\nlock = aquire_lock(datasource, interval, my_assigned_priority)\nif(successful) {\n  //do the work, but, do not commit\n} else {\n  //fail or maybe repeat from beginning\n}\n\nupgrade_lock_to_superpower(datasource, interval, my_assigned_priority)\nif(successful) {\n  //commit the work\n  release_lock(..)\n} else {\n  //fail\n}\n```\n\nOverlord implements following 3 APIs:\n\n```\n//trusted that client will make this call with appropriate\n//priority that has been assigned to it\nsynchronized aquire_lock(datasource, interval, priority) {\n  lock = get_cached_lock_with_overlapping_interval(datasource, interval)\n\n  if(lock == null || (priority < lock.priority && !lock.isSuperPower()) {\n    //accept request, put/update lock datasource,interval,priority in cache\n  } else {\n    //reject request\n  }\n}\n\n//trusted that client will make this call iff it had the lock\nsynchronized upgrade_lock_to_superpower(datasource, interval, priority) {\n  lock = get_cached_lock_with_same_interval_and_priority(datasource, interval, priority)\n  if(lock != null) {\n    lock.setSuperPower()\n  } else {\n    //reject request\n  }\n}\n\n//trusted that client will make this call iff it had the lock\nsynchronized release_lock(datasource, interval, priority) {\n  lock = get_cached_lock_with_same_interval_and_priority(datasource, interval, priority)\n  if(lock != null) {\n    //remove it\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI guess this can be improved more a little bit so that lock keeps some metadata inside the lock such as task id and timestamp when the lock was created etc, so that we can detect that some task aquired the lock and crashed without releasing the lock and remove such zhombie locks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/122571949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/122597072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1406#issuecomment-122597072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1406","id":122597072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjU5NzA3Mg==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-18T21:05:57Z","updated_at":"2015-07-18T21:05:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhaown
