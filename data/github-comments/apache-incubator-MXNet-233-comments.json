It seems that it can't be passed by name though. Passing it as in your example above works, but doing loss_func(output, label, sample_weight=sample_weight) doesn't work.

think it's okay for operators to work on a zero csr with empty `indptr` as long as the csr is checked if zero before performing any regular operations like the one exposed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/7920. In addition to what @eric-haibin-lin said about the intention of delaying memory allocation, I think it's also the intended way to avoid unnecessary memory allocation for zero csr tensors. We can provide a util function checking whether a sparse tensor (csr or rsp) is zero for being used in operator implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330371832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/330375741","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/7927#issuecomment-330375741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7927","id":330375741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDM3NTc0MQ==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-18T22:37:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T22:37:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You may need to set c as sym.var as well.
