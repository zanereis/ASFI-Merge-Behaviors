Ilya,\n\nSorry for the delay, I''m currently attending the QCon London and with limited access to my email.\n\nDaan merged the PR, but we did not create a PR to be merged towards Master. Since I'm out this week, we are waiting a few more days in order to get more tests done before we create a new PR.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/77342443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/77359047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/98#issuecomment-77359047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/98","id":77359047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzU5MDQ3","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-05T12:56:21Z","updated_at":"2015-03-05T12:56:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.

I guess your snippet is correct as well (check and cat file), using that approach.\n\n@pdion891 looking at the code at least on the VR side there is no password expiry period imposed by the server. I can sort of understand this, because someone could shutdown a server, do a reset password and if the VM won't get started we should store the password in the VR. But let's discuss the security aspects on what/how we should implement a self expiring cache. I propose:\n1. if we have served the password at least once, let's expire it in 15-30 minutes\n2. else, expire all the passwords in next 1-24 hours whether they have been served to user VMs (for resetting purposes) or not.\n\nComments?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/78217077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/78217494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/108#issuecomment-78217494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/108","id":78217494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjE3NDk0","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-11T07:39:50Z","updated_at":"2015-03-11T07:39:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 the merged patch on master does not include the closes #issues string before the signature, can you close it @ghxandsky ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/78217494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/78217785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/109#issuecomment-78217785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/109","id":78217785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjE3Nzg1","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-11T07:42:57Z","updated_at":"2015-03-11T07:42:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pyr looks good, should it have methods for doing/handling connection and reconnection?
