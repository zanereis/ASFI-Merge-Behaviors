Thanks for all the detailed information! \r\n\r\nAnswers to the good questions you raised \r\n\r\n> Is that the normal time for initial loading for Hudi tables, or we are doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nIt's hard to know what normal time is since it depends on schema, machine and so many things. But we should n't this very off. Tried to explain few things below. \r\n\r\n> Do we need a better cluster/recoures to be able to load the data for the first time?, because it is mentioned on Hudi confluence page that COW bulkinsert should match vanilla parquet writing + sort only.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to ultimately migrate a table (using bulk_insert once) and then do updates/deletes. I suggest, testing upserts/deletes rather than bulk_insert.. If you primarily want to do bulk_insert alone to get other benefits of Hudi. Happy to work with you more and resolve this. Perf is a major push for the next release. So we can def collaborate here\r\n\r\n\r\n> Does partitioning improves the upsert and/or compaction time for Hudi tables, or just to improve the analytical queries (partition pruning)?\r\n\r\nPartitioning would benefit the query performance obviously. But for writing itself, the data size matter more, I would say. \r\n\r\n> We have noticed that the most time spent in the data indexing (the bulk-insert logic itself) and not the sorting stages/operation before the indexing, so how can we improve that? should we provide our own indexing logic?\r\n\r\nNope. you don't have to supply you own indexing or anthing. Bulk insert does not do any indexing, it does a global sort (so we can pack records belonging to same partition closer into the same file as much) and then writes out files. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Few observations :** \r\n\r\n- 47 min job is gc-ing quite a bit. So that can affect throughput a lot. Have you tried configuring the jvm.\r\n- I do see fair bit of skews here from sorting, which may be affecting over all run times.. #1149 is trying to also provide a non-sorted mode, that tradeoffs file sizing for potentially faster writing.\r\n\r\nOn what could create difference between bulk_insert and spark/parquet :\r\n\r\n- I would also set `\"hoodie.parquet.compression.codec\" -> \"SNAPPY\"` since Hudi uses gzip compression by default, where spark.write.parquet will use SNAPPY \r\n- Hudi currently does an extra `df.rdd` conversion that could affect bulk_insert/insert (upsert/delete workloads are bound by merge costs, this matters less there). I don't see that in your UI though.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/612252471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/612258453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1457#issuecomment-612258453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1457","id":612258453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjI1ODQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"prashantwason","id":58448203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDQ4MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58448203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason","html_url":"https://github.com/prashantwason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-10T23:08:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T23:23:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Structure looks much better now. thanks @prashantwason ..\r\n> \r\n> I raised an issue on the need to copy the avro compatibility code into the project..

COW tables: \r\n   - Update to existing parquet file: Will raise as exception during commit as conversion of record to the writerSchema will fail. \r\n   - Insert to new parquet file: Will be ok.\r\n2.

Either an exception or the record may be missing the fields.\r\n\r\nSo even today, the pipeline may stall (due to exception). I dont think HUDI has a way out of it yet.

Adding javadocs to some classes seems a bit redundant.\r\n\r\nMy more consideration is: Constraint and standardization are conducive to the formation of good habits. Because the developers involved in the community are diverse. And many developers have a \"lazy psychology\", that is, without such constraints, they may rather not do it, not everyone has a good habit to think more. In fact, some test classes may be very simple and do not need to add a document description, but some classes may require, even some instructions and warnings.\r\n\r\nBut once we do not enable tool inspection, many contributors will be reluctant to do this out of \"lazy psychology\". In order to enable tool inspection, then we must maintain the unity of the entire style. This is my practice in the Flink

The tables mentioned on previous discussion is **lineitem** generated by tpch 30GB and 100GB, which has original parquet size of 6.7GB and 21GB respectively. \r\n\r\n- Schema for lineitem \r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-12 17-56-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20902425/79073448-f1d7de80-7ce6-11ea-80ea-f8a13ad960bc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- We have another version of lineitem with additional column last_updated with generated timestamp to define as PRECOMBINE_FIELD_OPT_KEY\r\n\r\n- Increments are 3% to 5% of the original base table count, 30% updates and 70% inserts.\r\n\r\n- We have 2 versions of generated updates, one which touches only the last quarter of the year and another one generated randomly to touch most of the parquet parts during updates. \r\n\r\n- Currently we generate no duplicates for the base table and increments.\r\n\r\nBased on the same test data we have done further attempts by modifying HoodieSparkSqlWriter itself, UserDefinedBulkInsertPartitioner, HoodieRecord, change the payload. I will share the test result for defining UserDefinedBulkInsertPartitioner because it looks similar as the approach you mentioned to avoid the sorting for bulk-insert:\r\n\r\nApplying bulk-insert for **lineitem**  generated from tpch 1GB \r\n**Table**            : 213MB parquet, 6M records, 16 columns and key is composite of 2 columns. \r\n**Spark Conf**  : 1 executor, 12 cores, 16GB, 32 shuffle, 32 bulk-insert-parallelism.\r\n**Hudi Version**: % \"hudi-spark-bundle\" % \"0.5.2-incubating\"\r\n**Spark**           : 2.4.5 with hadoop 2.7\r\n**Table Type**   : COW\r\n\r\n-  Using vanilla % \"hudi-spark-bundle\" % \"0.5.2-incubating\", spark stages \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-12 15-24-45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20902425/79073948-bdb1ed00-7ce9-11ea-8dd0-e12e6075c065.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see the data has been shuffled to disk twice, applying the sorting twice as well.\r\n\r\n- Eagerly persist the input RDD before the bulk-insert, which uses the same sorting provided before the bulk-insert.\r\n\r\n`@Override\r\npublic JavaRDD<HoodieRecord> repartitionRecords(JavaRDD records, int outputSparkPartitions)\r\n{ JavaRDD<HoodieRecord> data = ((JavaRDD<HoodieRecord>)records).sortBy(record -> {\r\n        return String.format(\"%s+%s\", record.getPartitionPath(), record.getRecordKey());\r\n    }, true, outputSparkPartitions)\r\n    .persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY());\r\n     data.foreach(record -> {});\r\n     return data;\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-12 15-36-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20902425/79074237-8b08f400-7ceb-11ea-96e6-99bcacb5419f.png)\r\n\r\nSo we avoided additional shuffle to disk, yet the performance still the same as well as we can't persist in memory for very large inputs.\r\n\r\n- Just return the RDD as it is, or (sort, partition the data based on the key columns) on the dataframe level before passing the dataframe to HudiSparkSqlWriter, then just return the data.\r\n\r\n`@Override\r\npublic JavaRDD<HoodieRecord> repartitionRecords(JavaRDD records, int outputSparkPartitions) {\r\n    return records;\r\n}`\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-12 15-37-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20902425/79074511-18007d00-7ced-11ea-90b4-40490fd78af6.png)\r\n\r\n**Note:** this approach impact the Upsert time significantly specially if you didn't apply any sorting to the data, it might be because the upsert operation touched most of the parquet parts.\r\n\r\nSo please correct me if I am wrong, all the attached spark stages to the thread shows most of time spent (bottle neck) in the count action which filter the records with invalid write status, it is actually a narrow transformation after the sorting operation.\r\nWe haven't checked the logic behind this action in details yet, I thought this might be the indexing operation and creating the metadata columns for Hudi table.\r\n\r\n\r\nReplaying to the questions and suggestion you mentioned:\r\n\r\n> If you are trying to ultimately migrate a table (using bulk_insert once) and then do updates/deletes. I suggest, testing upserts/deletes rather than bulk_insert.. If you primarily want to do bulk_insert alone to get other benefits of Hudi. Happy to work with you more and resolve this. Perf is a major push for the next release. So we can def collaborate here\r\n\r\nYes we need to fully migrate the table to Hudi and apply excessive upserts / insert operations over it  later. \r\nIf I get your suggestion right, would you suggest to initially load the table using upsert or insert operation for the whole table instead of bulk-insert? \r\nWe have tried that and it was extremely slower, consuming more memory and disk than bulk-insert.\r\nWe followed the documentation as well in the code which suggest to use the bulk-insert for initial table loading.\r\n\r\n> Optimizing the spark executor memory to avoid GC hits and using snappy compression\r\n\r\nWe actually have tried many optimizations related to spark yet the performance improvements is limited or no gain.

If you have monotonically increasing key (say timestamp prefix) and already know the partition to which an increment record (IIUC this means incoming writes) belong to, then upsert performance will be optimal.\r\n\r\n \r\n>We have 2 versions of generated updates, one which touches only the last quarter of the year and another one generated randomly to touch most of the parquet parts during updates.\r\n\r\nIf you have a workload that will touch every file, then you could use the #1402  that is being built.

I would not recommend trying this.. \r\n\r\n> Note: this approach impact the Upsert time significantly specially if you didn't apply any sorting to the data, it might be because the upsert operation touched most of the parquet parts.\r\n\r\nyes.. you are right.. sorting gives you a dataset which is initially sorted/ordered by keys and if you have ordered keys, hudi will preserve this and extract upsert performance by filtering out files not in range during indexing.. At Uber, when we moved all the tables to hudi, we found this one time sort, well worth the initial cost.. It repaid itself many times over the course of a quarter. \r\n\r\n\r\n>it is actually a narrow transformation after the sorting operation.\r\n\r\nIts the action that triggers the actual parquet writing. So the 30 second odd you see if the actual cost of writing data.. \r\n\r\n>If I get your suggestion right, would you suggest to initially load the table using upsert or insert operation for the whole table instead of bulk-insert?\r\n\r\nNo.. bulk_insert + sorting is what I recommend (with good key design) for large scale deployment like you are talking about.. if you don't want to convert all data, @bvaradar & @umehrot2 will have the ability to seamlessly bootstrap the data into hudi without rewriting in the next release.. (you ll also have the ability to do a one-time bulk_insert for last N partitions to get the upsert performance benefits as we discussed above)..\r\n\r\nI would be happy to jump on a call with you folks and get this moving along.. I am also very excited to work with a user like yourself and move the perf aspects of the project along more..

I want to address some of your comment and here are issues:\r\n1. I tried make data prep part of the deltastreamer themselves and then also provide same defaults for input/output paths, but at last I found my code the same as `org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.HoodieDeltaStreamer#main`, it seems that we don't have to add deltastreamer examples because the HoodieDeltaStreamer class is already a complete deltastreamer example. Maybe we just need to add some simple examples rather than a very complete and unified example.\r\n2. I wrote a `run_hoodie_examples.sh` to run the example and reuse spark-bundle/utilities-bundle instead of building a fat jar, but the build process of hudi-utilities-bundle will relocate `com.beust.jcommander.` to `org.apache.hudi.com.beust.jcommander.`, and my example have a dependency on `com.beust.jcommander.` and the spark-shell failed, so should I also add a relocation to  pom.xml of hudi-examples. \r\nHow do you think about these 2 problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/612881257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/612930401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1511#issuecomment-612930401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1511","id":612930401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjkzMDQwMQ==","user":{"login":"hddong","id":17537134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM3MTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17537134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong","html_url":"https://github.com/hddong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-13T14:48:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T14:48:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hmatu Before change, `upsert` is equivalent is `insert`, because target path must not present(will be delete if present).

Spark resource 256GB ram and 32 cores:\r\n\r\n**Case non-partitioned** \r\n\r\n- We use the suggested/recommended partition column(s) (we pick first column in the partition path), then project this partition column and apply distinct which will provide you with filter values you need to pass to next process of the pipe line.\r\n- The next step submit a sequential spark applications which filter the input data based on the passed filter value resulting in data frame of single partition.\r\n- Write (**bulk-insert**) the filtered dataframe as Hudi table with the provided partition column(s) using save-mode **append**\r\n- Hudi table being written partition by partition.\r\n- Query the Hudi table to check if it is valid table, and it looks valid.\r\n\r\n**Case partitioned** same as above, with faster filter operations. \r\n\r\n**Pros**: \r\n- Avoided a lot of disk spilling, GC hits. \r\n- Using less resources for initial loading.\r\n\r\n**Cons**: \r\n- No time improvements in case you have enough resources to load the table at once. \r\n- We ended up with partitioned table, which might not be needed in some of our use cases.\r\n\r\n**Questions**:\r\n- If this approach is valid or going to impact the upsert operations in the future?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> I would be happy to jump on a call with you folks and get this moving along.. I am also very excited to work with a user like yourself and move the perf aspects of the project along more..\r\n\r\nWe are excited as well to have a call together, please inform me how we can proceed on this meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/613563197/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/613613150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1457#issuecomment-613613150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1457","id":613613150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzYxMzE1MA==","user":{"login":"afilipchik","id":1406795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDY3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1406795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik","html_url":"https://github.com/afilipchik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afilipchik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-14T18:40:31Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T18:40:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I found a way to get out compaction situation.

@lamber-ken \r\n\r\nYes, I have resolved this problem.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the problem was in SBT memory that allocated default memory size 1GB. Then, I fixed it and set 8GB and transferring 5M records successfully finished in my local environment.\r\n\r\nNext, I have tried to transfer 30M records, but upsert failed again. I tunned *.parallelism parameters (Changed from 8 to 100) and everything went fine (20MB for each parquet file).\r\n\r\nAlso, I added parameter \"hoodie.memory.merge.max.size\" with value \"2004857600000\" that you had recommended. Upsert was hanging without this parameter (It is necessary to recheck again).\r\n\r\n@lamber-ken, can you explain to me, what the parameter is?\r\n\r\nUPD:\r\n\r\nRechecked without \"hoodie.memory.merge.max.size\" parameter and got error (heap size).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/615141491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/615161533","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1511#issuecomment-615161533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1511","id":615161533,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTE2MTUzMw==","user":{"login":"hddong","id":17537134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTM3MTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17537134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong","html_url":"https://github.com/hddong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hddong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T10:06:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T10:06:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yanghua Thanks for you review, had address them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/615161533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
