I believed I've identified the issue, but would you mind verifying it? The fix is in my branch, so you can either clone it or you can install it directly like this: \n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/jlowin/airflow@subdag_pool_issue_1225\n```\n\nThis branch includes the fixes from #1220, so we'd have to merge that first, but I think it's just about ready to go. I don't think #1220 directly impacts your issue, but it touches the same code so I'd like to avoid a messy conflict. Please let me know if you have any issues getting it running -- if this works for you I'll put through the PR.\n\nIf you're curious, here's what I believe is going on:\n- When you run a task in a pool, it doesn't actually run right away; first it becomes queued. This means that running a task in a pool actually requires executing the run command at least twice: first to place it in a queue, and second to move it from the queue to the executor. \n- When you run a `SchedulerJob`, it constantly checks for queued tasks and schedules them appropriately, so the \"run it twice\" problem is taken care of.\n- The catch is that `SubDagOperators` don't submit their subdags to the scheduler. Instead, they kick them off with a `BackfillJob`. And `BackfillJob` had a little logic hole that would never run queued tasks the critical second time. Instead, queued tasks would just sit in the Backfill loop forever and the backfill job would never end.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202150828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202150840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1224#issuecomment-202150840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1224","id":202150840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjE1MDg0MA==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-27T21:43:17Z","updated_at":"2016-03-27T21:43:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/badge/337646/landscape.svg?style=flat)](https://landscape.io/diff/311720)\nRepository health decreased by 0.02% when pulling **[e1ca19f](https://github.com/mtoma/airflow/commit/e1ca19f30efad248d3d306300a24a7e9708dc8e2) on mtoma:fix-issue-1223** into **[333e45b](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/commit/333e45bce4d47254e9bac52fe0612c9235030f1f) on airbnb:master**.\n- [2 new problems were found](https://landscape.io/diff/311720) (including 0 errors and 0 code smells).\n- No problems were fixed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/202150840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
