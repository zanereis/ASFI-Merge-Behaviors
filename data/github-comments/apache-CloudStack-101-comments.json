If you are active on on Github and are adding value to the project by reviewing code, I am willing to work with that.  Because I am not being strict about who is reviewing the code, I am also enforcing at least 2 people review the code so I get more eyes on ever PR.\n\nAs for the squash.  It may make sense to have some history, but there are a lot of commits in there that are entirely useless outside the greater context of this PR.  To me, the final version of the code merged trumps all.  If it is squashed then we can more easily evaluate the changes associated with this commit later.  If you think there are some points in the history of this feature that make sense to be called out as important, you can squash into 3 or 4 commits, but 43 commits for a single PR is crazy and will add more confusion than clarity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/207542455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/207543327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1478#issuecomment-207543327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1478","id":207543327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzU0MzMyNw==","user":{"login":"Slair1","id":17735593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzM1NTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17735593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1","html_url":"https://github.com/Slair1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Slair1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T18:15:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T18:16:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Created new PR #1480 in 4.7 branch\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/207543327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/207543372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1403#issuecomment-207543372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1403","id":207543372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzU0MzM3Mg==","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T18:16:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T18:16:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No problem, @swill, I can just squash them all.

thanks for doing this.  I suspect the travis run will fail so I will have to break my own rule and force merge.  :)  I will wait for it to finish regardless and I will get this in so we can better understand what is going on.  Thanks again for the quick response to this, this is very helpful.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/207625716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/207625965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1481#issuecomment-207625965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1481","id":207625965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzYyNTk2NQ==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T22:10:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T22:10:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@swill I would say let's wait for travis to go green on this and then merge.
