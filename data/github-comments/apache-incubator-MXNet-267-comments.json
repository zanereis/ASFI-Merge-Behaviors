The first dropout drops out random neurons in the first layer (h1) in the example below, and the second one drops out random neurons in layer h2. By dropping random neurons, dropout prevents overfitting because it forces the network to learn combinations of more robust features instead of only fine tuning weights of features that may be insignificant in a normal neural network. As a result, it might / probably will take longer to train the network. \r\n\r\nHere is my fixed network:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, auc\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\nbatch_size = 10000\r\ntrain_iter = mx.io.CSVIter(data_csv=\"feature_train_v1.csv\", data_shape=(50, ),\r\n                   label_csv=\"label_train_v1.csv\", label_shape= (1,), batch_size=batch_size,)\r\n\r\nval_iter = mx.io.CSVIter(data_csv = \"feature_validate_v1.csv\", data_shape=(50, ),\r\n                    label_csv=\"label_validate_v1.csv\", label_shape= (1,), batch_size = batch_size)\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\nnet = mx.sym.BatchNorm(data, fix_gamma=True)\r\nnet = mx.symbol.Dropout(net, p=0.5)\r\nh1 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=net, name='h1', num_hidden=50)\r\nnet = mx.sym.Activation(data=h1, act_type=\"relu\")\r\n\r\nnet = mx.sym.BatchNorm(net, fix_gamma=True)\r\nnet = mx.symbol.Dropout(net, p=0.5)\r\nh2 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=net, name='h2', num_hidden=25)\r\nnet = mx.sym.Activation(data=h2, act_type=\"relu\")\r\n\r\nnet = mx.sym.BatchNorm(net, fix_gamma=True)\r\nh3 = mx.sym.FullyConnected(data=net, name ='h3', num_hidden=1)\r\n\r\nsoftmax = mx.sym.LogisticRegressionOutput(data=h3, name='softmax') # Calculate the Loss !\r\n\r\nmodel = mx.mod.Module(softmax)\r\n\r\n# train the network\r\nmodel.fit( train_iter,\r\n            eval_data=val_iter,\r\n            eval_metric= roc_auc_score,\r\n            optimizer_params={'learning_rate':0.01, 'momentum': 0.9},\r\n            num_epoch=9)\r\n\r\nmodel.score(val_iter, roc_auc_score)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI fixed my error after realizing a few issues. \r\n* Since it is a classification problem, it helps to use metrics like AUC or cross entropy.\r\n* Try using at least 3 fully connected layers. \r\nIf you are doing a classification problem and are using sklearn's AUC function, it won't work for datasets that don't have enough negative labels (in a binary classification function). \r\n\r\nI found MXNet's website and tutorial a bit outdated and hard to follow when I was learning it around January. I had to experiment by reading the github repo - you'd probably have to do the same :| . \r\n\r\nI no longer use MXNet (I started using pytorch :) ... its nice!), but hope this helps.
