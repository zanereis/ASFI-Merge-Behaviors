This tarball is included inside the `-bin.tar.gz` distribution file for users to extract and build for their platform. I think we provide a convenience script to unpack and call `make` for them (in case `tar xvf ... && cd ... && make` is too hard :smiley_cat:)\r\n\r\nYou can see this tarball by running `mvn clean package -DskipTests` and looking at `server/native/target/accumulo-native-*.tar.gz`\r\n\r\nI would be interested in understanding the benefits of moving to `cmake`. As I understand it, most of the benefits come from the ability to reduce the usage of other autotools/configure stuffs, but we don't use any of that. We just have a *very* trivial `Makefile`.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on user-buildability, rather than providing pre-built native binaries. If we do switch to `cmake`, it seems like something that could happen as its own independent task, but I would want to maintain our current practice of making it user-buildable, rather than pre-building binaries.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/548079456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/548127511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1398#issuecomment-548127511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1398","id":548127511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODEyNzUxMQ==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T21:49:22Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T21:49:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @ctubbsii sorry, I wasn't sure if this one would turn into a bigger fix.

I agree that the make file is relatively simple, but I'm afraid it's not about simplicity. \r\n\r\nIn the case where you have external projects that you are linking and using ( in my branch I am ), there is an ExternalProject command which not only simplifies that but helps ensures that you don't link incorrectly. It also helps avoiding pollution of your source especially when you are only including it in binary form ( as we are ). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I saw some version specific variables embedded in the make file. This can go away because CMAKE takes all of that into account and automates the generation of your make file. \r\n\r\nEven more so we use -O3...frankly we should be allowing this to be \r\noverridden. There are other modes ( -Os if that were preferred in certain deployments ) that have practical applications. As a rule of thumb we should probably use a lower optimization level ( -O2 versus -O3 ) level with select flags specified. My hope is to prove this via google benchmark. Managing those flags across GCC versions would be simpler with CMAKE, because that is part of its job. \r\n\r\nThe final point is that adding dependencies like google bench mark and google test would be far simpler with CMAKE for not only the reason above, but because we can manage those dependencies. I'm certainly not suggesting we take a stab at the cmake in this issue, but I included two additional dependencies and added them to a \"thirdparty\" directory That's not unreasonable, but those source files do not need to be included even by way of a git sub module. ExternalProject is preferred IMO. \r\n\r\nIn the same vein as google benchmark I did some tests with jemalloc which showed dramatic improvement in certain use cases. Showing those benchmarks and allowing a static link into the SO would be ideal and much easier with CMAKE. All of this can be done with make, but why reinvent the wheel?\r\n\r\nYour point of \"we just have a very trivial Makefile\" is spot on, but when you begin to change that, using prior work versus writing our own allocator for example, I think the argument for cmake begins to gain traction. Further, as you integrate things like google benchmark to prove, then keeping the Makefile is more an effort in adding work, complexity, and hidden bugs than incorporating something that has minimal impact. It would be stated that this would be totally transparent to the user and a feature inherently supported by maven's infra.

I'm not opposed. I just want to understand the benefits.\r\n\r\nI do wonder if it's a good idea to add third party dependencies to code which is currently very small, and has very minimal dependencies. Even if it's a performance benefit... or a maintenance benefit (less code)... it may not be worth the trade off. It'd be nice if that could be done as an independent task.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, there are 3 things being discussed (and worked on) here:\r\n\r\n1. Change the build system for the native code (make -> cmake and/or improvements to the hard-coded flags in the Makefile)\r\n2. Modernize the code (using more recent C++ standards)\r\n3. Reduce some of our custom code with third party libraries that do the job better\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, all three of these are possibly good improvements, but they should be decoupled from one another. We're talking about making all these changes at once, and I think they each have their own pros and cons, and they should be done completely independently.

I'd like to refocus with a question: Do you have a concrete end goal in mind here, and is that goal important to you?\r\n\r\nI ask if it's important to you because my impression is that you're trying to get more involved, but that these specific code changes have stalled (on the side of the reviewers) due to being high-risk and low-reward (because the code is complicated and the goal has gotten fuzzy). I understand that stall can make you feel discouraged, which we definitely don't want to do.\r\n\r\nSo, if it is important to you, perhaps there's some way you can define your overall goal more concretely so that others can understand and so that you can make progress incrementally towards it. But, if this area of the code is not that important to you, then it might be a good idea to abandon the work because the risk-reward tradeoff isn't worth it, and for us to help encourage you contributing elsewhere. I'm okay with either direction, but currently, I worry this issue isn't headed in a direction that makes the best use of your time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/550145368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/550149660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1060#issuecomment-550149660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1060","id":550149660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDE0OTY2MA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T05:23:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T05:23:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I

looked into this a bit today.  Another issue I discovered with ZooLock's use of ZooReader is that it automatically creates new Zookeeper objects when a session has expired.  I am not sure if this is causing any problems, but its a concern I have.  The following is some background info.\r\n\r\n * Zookeeper objects have a one to relationship with a zookeeper session.  When a session expires zookeeper objects become non-functional.\r\n * Zoolock relies on ephemeral nodes which are automatically deleted when a session expires.\r\n\r\nIt may be ok that new Zookeeper objects are automatically created because the ephemeral node will cease to exist and this would be visible through the new zookeeper object.\r\n\r\nBecause of the tight coupling between zoolock, ephemeral nodes, zookeeper objects, and zookeeper sessions I think it may be better if zoolock directly uses zookeeper w/o any intermediate abstraction layer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/552017270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/553029850","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1391#issuecomment-553029850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1391","id":553029850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzAyOTg1MA==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T18:19:41Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T18:19:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe this is ready for merge, just waiting to see if there are any additional comments since removing the draft status.

Even if SPI doesn't affect data like iterators do, it has a nice way to access server configuration.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the LRUMap was made protected so users could override it with a different implementation. Whatever the case, I think this type could be a java.util.Map.\r\n\r\nThe logger should probably just be private.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/553047285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/553078989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1422#issuecomment-553078989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1422","id":553078989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzA3ODk4OQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T19:35:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T19:35:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems like ZooCache.getChildren may still set watchers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/553078989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/553099142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1415#issuecomment-553099142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1415","id":553099142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzA5OTE0Mg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-12T20:26:05Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T20:26:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could add an \"allows\" line for the service environment instead of promoting it to public API.
