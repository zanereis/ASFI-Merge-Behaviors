Example:\n\n``` scala\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10)\nprintln(\"%table col\\tcol2\\nqwe\\t123\\n\")\nprintln(\"%html <h3> This is a hack </h3>\")\n```\n\n In that case, what would be displayed ? A table or the HTML bloc ? I guess that in the source code of method `getType()` when we loop through all the types enums, the first type found in the output string will be retained.\n\nBut then doing `msg.substring(magicLength + msg.indexOf(magic))` will give very different results depending on whether we match **%table** or **%html** before.\n\nIs this behavior deterministic or just depending on the order of the type enums ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/124078145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/124079421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/164#issuecomment-124079421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/164","id":124079421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDA3OTQyMQ==","user":{"login":"eranwitkon","id":2227083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjcwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2227083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon","html_url":"https://github.com/eranwitkon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eranwitkon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-23T12:22:22Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T12:22:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes the current behavior is depending on the order of the type enums, and a better solution is to allow complex output.
