Perhaps we can get it into the first maintenance release for 4.11.\r\n\r\nIt causes two problems:\r\n\r\n1) For non-managed storage: If you create a volume snapshot from, say, storage pool 1 and later delete storage pool 1, then you can no longer use the volume snapshot (because we can't find an applicable host for the copy operation with this new logic).\r\n\r\n2) For managed storage: The SAN-assisted volume snapshot use case fails. This only applies to XenServer and only when locationtype=secondary is passed into createSnapshot (that parameter is only used for managed storage and primary is the default value for that parameter). As far as I know, only one company currently uses this API this way. This company also is accustomed to patching CloudStack and using those modified versions in production, so I don't think we need to hold this particular release up because they can use the 4.11 release with this PR in their production environment (even before it \"officially\" comes out in a maintenance release).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/357557367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/357557644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2402#issuecomment-357557644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2402","id":357557644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzU1NzY0NA==","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-15T00:50:52Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T00:50:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rhtyd
