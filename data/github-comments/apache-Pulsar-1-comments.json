What about doing it similar to how Kafka does it?\n\n```\n# If set, broker will advertise to discovery using this address;\n# if empty, broker will advertise using the hostname, unless bindOnLocalhost\nadvertiseBrokerAddress=<ip address or hostname>\n```\n\nYet to figure out this will work if the broker binds on the `hostname`. It might be a good idea to allow people set the bind address / host. For example:\n\n```\n# to bind on all interfaces, set to 0.0.0.0\nbrokerBindAddress=<ip or hostname>\n```\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/248063802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/248066797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/23#issuecomment-248066797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/23","id":248066797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODA2Njc5Nw==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-19T17:47:32Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T17:47:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, I see.
