Thanks for the quick review. I didn't intended to make such large change at the beginning, but found many things are coupled together that I have to make such large change. Several suggestions for you how to review and read it. \r\n\r\n* I didn't intended to make the code style change, this is due to I move some files in intellij and intellij automatically fix the code style issue. You can just ignore these code style changes\r\n* I move the interpreter package from `zeppelin-zengine` to `zeppelin-interpreter`, this is needed for this refactoring.\r\n* The overall change is the same as I described in the design doc. I would suggest you to read the unit test first. These unit test is very readable and easy to understand what the code is doing now.  `InterpreterFactoryTest`, `InterpreterGroupTest`, `InterpreterSettingTest`, `InterpreterSettingManagerTest`,  `RemoteInterpreterTest`, \r\n* The RemoteFunction I introduced is for reducing code duplicates when we use RPC.\r\n* The changes in `Job.java` and `RemoteScheduler` is for fixing the race issue bug. This bug cause the flaky test we see often in ZeppelinSparkClusterTest.pySparkTest\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/310564840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/310565199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2431#issuecomment-310565199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2431","id":310565199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDU2NTE5OQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-23T04:00:02Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T04:00:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@felixcheung Please help review.

@felixcheung I thought about this again. I don't have concern on this PR, but have concern on how user should interact with shell interpreter.  I think the shell interpreter should behave as close as bash terminal of linux. That means the user should call `kinit` if he want to run shell command in kerberized cluster just as he did in linux shell terminal. For now, the shell interpreter of zeppelin share the same keytab/principal for all users even when in isolated and impersonated mode which is a big security hole.

A user whoever configures Zeppelin with this configuration i.e. have a keytab/principal configured and enable \"user impersonation\", is aware that this keytab file is being shared with various users (which is not the default interpreter setting that we ship with Zeppelin), and if (s)he doesn't want this behaviour they can always fall back to the default option (which is not configuring any). \r\nThe reason shell interpreter does this is to make this operation seamless (just like JDBC, Livy, etc.) and when we finally have user level interpreter setting (each user have their own interpreter setting), they can configure their private keytab/principal and it will continue to work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/310973572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/310978525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2427#issuecomment-310978525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2427","id":310978525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDk3ODUyNQ==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T06:58:49Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T06:58:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@test2016new
