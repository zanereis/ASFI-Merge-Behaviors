I would say this error occurs roughly 33% of the time I repeat the process described above.\r\n2. I'm not explicitly updating the `druid_pendingSegments` or `druid_segments` tables between step 2 and 4. I generally don't touch anything in metadata storage and always try to work within the standard Druid api's. I don't trust myself to not break something :) But I do occasionally peek in there when I'm doing some debugging.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a small utility that will suspend a supervisor and drop various segments for a given time period from that data source before resuming supervisor. It does wait for tasks to finish and segments to be fully unloaded before continuing on to the next steps. I updated this utility to go and delete any entries for a given data source in the `druid_pendingSegments` table before resuming the supervisor. This seems to prevent the duplicate key error from occurring.\r\n\r\nAny chance there were some changes between 0.14.1 and 0.16.0 to the way the `druid_pendingSegments` table is manipulated? I upgraded straight from 0.14.1 to 0.16.0 and skipped some of the 0.15.X versions. Maybe that was a bad move on my part? I don't believe I had this issue in 0.14.1 so I'm guessing something changed between that release and 0.16.0. Thanks again for all your help!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/541202721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/541208594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7066#issuecomment-541208594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7066","id":541208594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTIwODU5NA==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T20:14:40Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T20:14:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Aw, now it is triggering false spelling errors for config names: https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-druid/jobs/596417943#L274\r\n\r\ncan add entries here https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/website/.spelling to make it ignore it, I'm +1 after CI too though","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/541208594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/541209475","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8663#issuecomment-541209475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8663","id":541209475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTIwOTQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T20:17:30Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T20:18:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The biggest change around the segment ID allocation was #7547 between 0.14.1 and 0.16.0, but it shouldn't change anything about the new segment ID verification.

Maybe Jackson provides a way to get errors in a more programmatic way and we can write our own messages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/542266767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/542287669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4194#issuecomment-542287669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4194","id":542287669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjI4NzY2OQ==","user":{"login":"smokemonster99","id":43358107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU4MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43358107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99","html_url":"https://github.com/smokemonster99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smokemonster99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T16:05:41Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T16:05:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@pjain1 thanks!

Hmm, I haven't turned on the minor compaction features mentioned in that issue, so I don't suspect that to be the culprit either.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't share those exact segment id's that are in conflict. But I am looking through those tables and can describe some of the oddities I am seeing. One thing I have noticed in the `druid_pendingSegments` table is that the id in conflict has a `created_date` that is typically from the previous day. For instance, I am getting an id conflict today (2019-10-15) for an entry in `druid_pendingSegments` with a `created_date` of 2019-10-14. That seems a little odd to me that the resumed Kafka indexing task would not attempt to place an entry in `druid_pendingSegments` with an updated value for the `created_date` field. There are other entries in the `druid_pendingSegments` table with a `created_date` field from today (2019-10-15).\r\n\r\nI did a quick query in the `druid_segments` table to see what segments were available for the time chunk in conflict. I found that all the segments in this table had been unpublished (`used = false`). This was the behavior I was expecting as I was dropping old segments before new ones were created.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your assistance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/542288337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/542291030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8672#issuecomment-542291030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8672","id":542291030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjI5MTAzMA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-15T16:13:24Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T16:13:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

the entries in `druid_pendingSegments` table are never updated but should be reused if possible. The way the segment ID allocation works is as below:\r\n\r\n1) a task asks a new segment ID to the overlord with `datasource`, `interval`, and `sequenceName`. Segment ID is unique per `datasource`, `interval`, and `sequenceName` and segment ID allocation is idempotent. This means, if a task asks with the same `datasource`, `interval`, and `sequenceName`, the overlord will return the same segment ID instead of creating a new one. The base `sequenceName` is generated as [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/seekablestream/supervisor/SeekableStreamSupervisor.java#L1813-L1848), and each task will attach a sequential number whenever intermediate publish is triggered.\r\n2) The overlord first looks up `druid_pendingSegments` table to see if there's a reusable segment ID.\r\n3) If not, it looks up both `druid_segments` and `druid_pendingSegments` tables to find the next available segment ID. This is done by searching for the max partition id of all segments in the interval including both `published` and `unpublished` ones. The new segment will have the partition id of `current max partition id + 1`.\r\n4) Once it finds the next segment ID, it will insert it into the metadata store. Otherwise, the segment ID allocation fails.\r\n\r\n`2) - 4)` should be done atomically.

once.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/542903549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/542927214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8682#issuecomment-542927214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8682","id":542927214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjkyNzIxNA==","user":{"login":"aditya-r-m","id":14856943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODU2OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14856943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya-r-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya-r-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T23:07:02Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T23:07:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson

An example tuningConfig could be\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n>     \"tuningConfig\" : {\r\n>       \"type\" : \"index_parallel\",\r\n>       \"maxNumConcurrentSubTasks\": 2, // max number of sub queries that can be run at the same time\r\n>       \"forceGuaranteedRollup\": true,\r\n>       \"partitionsSpec\": {\r\n>         \"type\": \"hashed\",\r\n>         \"numShards\": 3 // number of segments per time chunk after compaction\r\n>       }\r\n>     }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nHi @jihoonson, I split data into different segments by single dimension tenant_id for the multitenancy scene. In this way, I can get higher query performance that filters on the tenant_id dimension. But tenant data was skew, so the segment size was not perfect. For example, the max segment size was nearly 18GB but the min segment size was 5MB. Then perform queries on the 18GB segment ware more slower than that partitioned by all dimensions. \r\n\r\nAssume there is a way(eg. maxRowsPerSegment=10000000) can split the max segment into some more smaller segments, the queries will be quick. But ```maxRowsPerSegment``` can not exist when specify ```numShards``` option.\r\n\r\nHow do you think about this scene?\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543125241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543314028","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8689#issuecomment-543314028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8689","id":543314028,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzMxNDAyOA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-17T18:55:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T18:55:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnaous

If intention is to allow quick experimentation really then I think it is ok to setup the proxy mechanism at router but with a configuration that enables such proxy and set to `false` by default. Only ask would be that web console should continue to work for all other things even if generic proxy is disabled at router.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543354123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543436384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8487#issuecomment-543436384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8487","id":543436384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzQzNjM4NA==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T01:12:35Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T01:12:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson Addressed latest comments, also added a \"round\" parameter to the HLL sketch estimate postagg, and fixed the `numStdDev` param for `HLL_SKETCH_ESTIMATE_WITH_ERROR_BOUNDS` to actually be optional (it's optional in the docs and the underlying postagg).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543436384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543445057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8666#issuecomment-543445057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8666","id":543445057,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzQ0NTA1Nw==","user":{"login":"freyayunfu","id":1749814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDk4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1749814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu","html_url":"https://github.com/freyayunfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freyayunfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T01:44:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T01:44:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Now all integration tests fail in CI, e. g. see https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-druid/jobs/597175561\r\n> \r\n> In this PR: #6702 I've experimented with another approach to solving this, like\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> if [[ \"$OSTYPE\" == \"darwin\"* ]]; then\r\n>   # On Mac OS X resolveip may not be available\r\n>   export DOCKER_HOST_IP=$(dig +short $HOSTNAME | awk '{ print ; exit }')\r\n> else\r\n>   export DOCKER_HOST_IP=$(resolveip -s $HOSTNAME)\r\n> fi\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> See [changes to Dockerfile and some other files](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/6702/files#diff-50142906cf6607133af36014a523dbcf) but without much success, either\r\n\r\nThanks @leventov  But before we do the PR for selfDiscovered endpoint, do we know what is the reason for the connection refused for coordinator in integration test? Is it because we didn't wait for enough time so that zookeeper hasn't added the node to cluster, or something else? I mean, I don't think PR #6702 will resolve the issue before we confirm the reason why the integration test failed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543445057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/543522609","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6715#issuecomment-543522609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6715","id":543522609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MzUyMjYwOQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-18T05:48:15Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T05:48:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been marked as stale due to 280 days of inactivity.
