been using `4.0.1` and I have the same problem, it took me 5-7 minutes to start up the app.\r\n\r\nThen I google it, one way is to skip the method, which I haven't adopted. Copy the class `TableMetaDataInitializer` into your project, and remove `loadDefaultTables` method.\r\n\r\nThen I looked into the code, I found when `findActualDefaultDataSourceName` returns `Optional.absent()`, it will not run into the actual loading. So I assume in some cases, `loadDefaultTables()` is not required, and I'v only used table sharding with sharding-jdbc, so there comes the second solution,  I configured two `<sharding:master-slave-rule>` in `<sharding:master-slave-rules>`, and actually the second one is a placeholder which I never used, and everything works fine for me, so far so good.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/605823201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/605824759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4862#issuecomment-605824759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4862","id":605824759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTgyNDc1OQ==","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T07:14:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T07:14:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Will
