We create an `OutputFileFactory` per writer,  https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/spark/v3.5/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/source/SparkWrite.java#L667. Every `OutputFileFactory` should generate a unique file name, https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/io/OutputFileFactory.java#L99 the relevant part here being the last part where it's a monotonically increasing file number.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can see this maybe happening is if there are somehow multiple OutputFileFactory's happening concurrently (thus multiple concurrent writers in the same task, which I don't think can happen. but that's the part i'll need to double check).
