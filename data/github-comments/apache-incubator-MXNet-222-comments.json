If you have to stay in the synchronous land, further increase to the batch size could help. Since switching to dist_sync_device doesn't help the speed, I guess the locality assumption for GPUs doesn't apply and the bandwidth among the GPUs may even be less than from your CPU to other machines (which is through IB). In this case the bottleneck is the GPU communication and IB won't help much, and you need higher ratio of compute to

That is not entirely true - I agree with @solin319 that this WaitToRead should not be necessary (the actual communication is done in the lambda pushed to the engine that has send_buf as read dependency, so it will wait for it to be ready). What is more, this basically delays scheduling other copies from GPU to CPU for subsequent communications, thus limiting scaling.\r\nThe PR introducing that line mentions crashes when using kvstore in imperative mode. I'm not familiar really how much does imperative way differs from symbolic as far as engine is concerned, but I don't think it should be that different that the dependencies stop working.
