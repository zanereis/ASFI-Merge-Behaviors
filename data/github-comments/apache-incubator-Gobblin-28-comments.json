 Ok I will get with @jinhyukchang about merging our code. It seems I can pass the ci tests ok, but I can't seem to have much impact on the testing coverage. Can you or @ibuenros take a look?\n\nWhat I don't understand is how my testing coverage can decrease for an unmodified file e.g. `BaseDataPublisher.java` Nevertheless, I wrote some tests for the `OracleExtractor`, `SqlQueryUtils`, and the `JdbcExtractor`, but it doesn't seem to have much effect. I'm also wondering why the coveralls test does not show the new tests for Oracle.\n\nI've never used CI or testing coverage suites before, so I'm a little unsure how to interpret my results for the
