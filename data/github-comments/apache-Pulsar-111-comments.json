@merlimat  - That is another problem that I would like to highlight. Suppose I have a schema that we are currently using in production with a Customer that has the following Nullable Avro Enum field - It is Not implemented in Pulsar Functions or pulsar API:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"exampleEnum\",\r\n     \"type\": [\"null\", {\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"enum\",\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"ExampleEnum\",\r\n\t\t\"symbols\": [\"YES\", \"NO\"]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI am doing initial work to see if we can migrate to use Pulsar Functions and the Avro tools provided in the pulsar-client instead of the current implementation. But...\r\nIf I do AvroSchema.of( <Classname of Pojo> ). I get the following Enum field in my definition when marking a field as @Nullable (which is not backwards compatible with our current production Schema - the generated schema will have **,\"default\": null** added at the end): \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"exampleEnum\",\r\n     \"type\": [\"null\", {\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"enum\",\r\n\t\t\"name\": \"ExampleEnum\",\r\n\t\t\"symbols\": [\"YES\", \"NO\"]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"default\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe use case I have for this one is that I am trying to implement a current production Use Case with Pulsar Functions - 1. I use AvroSchema.of() to generate the schema and 2. I use schema.encode(OBJECT) to Serialize before publishing to a pulsar topic.\r\n\r\nIf I use the avro-tools jar, following the directions for generating a schema along with Using the Avro java library.... I can Serialize / Deserialize messages With the Schema definition text file and my POJO that was generated from avro-tools jar. Using this workaround along with Pulsar Functions works but it is not utilizing the schema.encode() and AvroSchema.of() which is how we should be using Avro Schema's with Pulsar and is much more convenient if I could do that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/492797526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/492806815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4062#issuecomment-492806815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4062","id":492806815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjgwNjgxNQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-15T20:14:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T20:14:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run
