RPG still shows \"XYZ -> 2\". yet it transmits only to one public port (one that is in the child PG)\r\n\r\nThis is expected. The '2' representing the number of available ports. Not necessary mean actively transmitting. In your case there are two possible ports (in the root and in the child PG).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/477960874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/477964478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3351#issuecomment-477964478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3351","id":477964478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzk2NDQ3OA==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-29T11:26:55Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T11:26:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @moranr and @andrewmlim for the UX related feedback. I've started incorporating them.

Change server's return code from 409 to 400 for port duplication. I can do this, but not confident enough, because 409 also does make sense in case if another port has been added by a different user..\r\n2. Keeps the port new/config dialog open with empty port name, but close it with duplicate error or any other errors than 400. This is the common behavior for UI.\r\n3. Keeps the port new/config dialog open regardless of the status code. This can be a weird UX sometimes.

I set its value to 10.\r\nSo there, on `HTTP_ERROR: HTTP/1.1 420 Enhance Your Calm` messages, the client will try to reconnect after 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 1m20s, 2m40s, 5m20s, 5m20s, 5m20s, 5m20s and then stops with `STOPPED_BY_ERROR: Retries exhausted`.\r\n\r\nRetry delay will not exceet 320s (5m20s) because of the `BasicReconnectionManager` configuration:\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/hbc/blob/hbc-2.2.0/hbc-core/src/main/java/com/twitter/hbc/BasicReconnectionManager.java#L25-L29\r\nINITIAL_EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF_MILLIS = 5000;\r\nMAX_EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF_MILLIS = 320000;\r\n\r\nThis page https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limiting.html (\"Exponential back-off pattern for streaming\" section) explains that the client should implement an exponential back-off pattern in subsequent reconnection attempts (e.g. wait 1 second, then 2 seconds, then 4, 8, 16, etc), with some reasonable upper limit. \r\n\r\ndetailed log here for test 2:\r\n```\r\n2019-04-04 09:01:07,753 INFO [NiFi Web Server-1485] o.a.n.c.s.StandardProcessScheduler Starting GetTwitter[id=69741800-9749-3439-9f3c-43b640162b97]\r\n2019-04-04 09:01:07,762 INFO [Timer-Driven Process Thread-3] com.twitter.hbc.httpclient.BasicClient New connection executed: GetTwitter[id=69741800-9749-3439-9f3c-43b640162b97], endpoint: /1.1/statuses/filter.json?delimited=length&stall_warnings=true\r\n2019-04-04 09:01:07,762 INFO [Timer-Driven Process Thread-3] o.a.n.c.s.TimerDrivenSchedulingAgent Scheduled GetTwitter[id=69741800-9749-3439-9f3c-43b640162b97] to run with 1 threads\r\n2019-04-04 09:01:07,763 INFO [hosebird-client-io-thread-0] com.twitter.hbc.httpclient.ClientBase GetTwitter[id=69741800-9749-3439-9f3c-43b640162b97] Establishing a connection\r\n2019-04-04 09:01:08,149 INFO [Flow Service Tasks Thread-1] o.a.nifi.controller.StandardFlowService Saved flow controller org.apache.nifi.controller.FlowController@6b8c9cdb // Another save pending = false\r\n2019-04-04 09:01:08,671 WARN [hosebird-client-io-thread-0] o.a.h.c.protocol.ResponseProcessCookies Invalid cookie header: \"set-cookie: personalization_id=\"v1_xU89nE0M8Mz5TpWr2r1VmQ==\"; Max-Age=63072000; Expires=Sat, 3 Apr 2021 09:01:08 GMT; Path=/; Domain=.twitter.com\".

Will not attempt to reconnect\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion the new property introduced to make the number of reties configurable is needed to let a chance to the client to get the connection to Twitter API up and running. With only 5 retries, in my experience I often reach the timeout and lost the connection. In my past test made a few weeks ago I got to the conclusion that I need at least 7 retries. I now set the value to 10 in my configurations.\r\n\r\nAnd after running my last test I also conclude that removing `client.reconnect()` on `HTTP_ERROR` does not change the behavior. So, this part of the merge may be left behind if the risk of regression is too high.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/479878565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/479883033","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2866#issuecomment-479883033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2866","id":479883033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTg4MzAzMw==","user":{"login":"ai-christianson","id":24681233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgxMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24681233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson","html_url":"https://github.com/ai-christianson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T12:48:47Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T12:48:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @SarthakSahu.

for filing this JIRA and creating this PR @SimonLinder! I also appreciate the write up in the JIRA. It makes this much easier for me to review.\r\n\r\n- Good catch on the incorrect null check.\r\n- If we can identify the fact that the IdP cannot support what we require, it's better to throw the exception to prevent startup. This is why there are so many checks in the constructor.\r\n- I didn't realize the claims specified in the call to the Authorization endpoint had any impact on a subsequent call to details returned from a UserInfo endpoint. \r\n- From my initial testing with various IdP implementations, not all supported the email claim in their Authorization endpoint. Many did, however, support returning it in the subsequent call to the UserInfo endpoint.\r\n- There were others though, that did not support an email field in their UserInfo endpoint. We have received requests [1] to allow for additional configuration over what field we use to identify a user.\r\n\r\nI am concerned with requiring the email scope be part of the Authorization request would be too limiting. From your experience, would you have any guidance on how we could try to remain as flexible, identify users using any field (from the UserInfo endpoint), and work against as many IdP's as possible?\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2346","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/480051136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/480119459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3405#issuecomment-480119459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3405","id":480119459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDExOTQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T01:34:02Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T01:34:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That's right, thanks @lfrancke!

But in this particular case, as stated in the spec of the discovery end, it is not mandatory to send the supported scopes, thus if the scope **email** is not returned, it is not correct to suppose that this scope is not supported. Therefore I would not make that check within the constructor. Same goes with the **openid** scope.\r\nI came across this issue with an implementation of the [IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io/), where all **supported_scopes** where set to null, which is totally fine, but not RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\nI can follow your concern about removing the **lookupEmail()** function. And I think you're right about this. Therefore I would suggest to leave that function as is, be it as a fallback, but removing the check in the constructor (as I already did) and always adding the **email** scope (as I already did). Especially the fix/work-around for [#2346](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2346) will then be supported.\r\n\r\nIf you're agreeing to my suggestion I would change that accordingly and adjust my commit.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSimon","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/480172395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/480191338","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3394#issuecomment-480191338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3394","id":480191338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDE5MTMzOA==","user":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T08:24:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T08:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/480191338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/480312958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3399#issuecomment-480312958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3399","id":480312958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDMxMjk1OA==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T15:12:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T15:12:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, thanks for the fix!
