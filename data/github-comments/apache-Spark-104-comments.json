(It took me a while to look at it and find bugs, but there were quite a few and I'm sure I didn't find them all.)\n\nA lot of concepts _could_ be added to the expression hierarchy, but the goal of Catalyst is to instead allow self contained rules to perform optimizations.  By keeping these optimization rules self contained it is much easier to look in one place and reason about their correctness.  Making the rule simple while pushing all of the complex logic to many different places in the code is not the goal here.\n\nThe only reason nullability is modeled in the expression hierarchy at all is because it is a fairly fundamental concept that is  part of the schema of the data.\n\nRegarding HiveGenericUdf, I'm not sure how the three state solution allows us to do any extra folding.  The UDF is still a black box and we have no idea how its going to respond to null inputs.\n\nRegarding your last point about code generation, we don't need three states.  We already know if we need to track a nullable bit when doing code generation with the current two state implementation.  If it is possible statically determine a value to be null, that will have already been done by optimization rules and we will just have a null literal.  All we need is a special rule that generates the AST for `Literal(null, _)`.  So, actually I think the code generation logic is simpler with this implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41753498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41753574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/476#issuecomment-41753574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/476","id":41753574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzUzNTc0","user":{"login":"etrain","id":1326181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjYxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1326181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain","html_url":"https://github.com/etrain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etrain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-30T02:04:50Z","updated_at":"2014-04-30T02:04:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Before I get too deep into this review - I want to step back and think about whether we expect the model in this case to be on the order of the size of the data - I think it is, and if so, we may want to consider representing the model as RDD[DocumentTopicFeatures] and RDD[TopicWordFeatures], similar to what we do with ALS.

this can be patched downstream, but that would not fix this for any other distro. Ideally, the dependency is set to 0.9.0 when built for Hadoop 2.3.0+. As we've seen in other cases, it's possible to manage this with more profiles in the build -- a PITA, but certainly possible. (I don't know if this helps the SBT build though, but presumably some similar logic about the Hadoop version is possible there.)\n\nThe funny thing is that this dependency is only needed at runtime. (Really should be declared as <scope>runtime</scope>) I am still not sure why hadoop-client doesn't package it. However, I wonder if, in the context of a Hadoop cluster, it's going to be on the classpath anyway? and then it would be the right version in all cases. What if you remove the dependency entirely, so it's not even in the assembly?\n\nI actually bet that works, and is simple. However I think it means that s3 would no longer work if running Spark by itself, so is probably a non-starter.\n\nSo, a new hadoop2.3.0 profile? that we try to trigger based on well-known hadoop.version values?\nI understand you've confirmed that 0.9.0 won't work with earlier versions since earlier versions use 0.7.x?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/41770038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
