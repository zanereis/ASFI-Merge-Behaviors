There are two cases:\r\n> \r\n>     1. SINGA params <- ONNX Initializer\r\n>        The params of an operator come from the ONNX Initializer(pre-stored weights). This part is ok now.\r\n> \r\n>     2. **SINGA params <- ONNX operator, dynamic graph**\r\n>        For some operators of ONNX(OneHot, Tile, Gather, Reshape, Slice, Clip). Some attributes of these operators, they come from other operators' outputs. We cannot handle this case.\r\n>        For example, in BERT, for this Reshape operator, its shape comes from the previous operator:\r\n>        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14108933/82379081-dcc63c00-9a58-11ea-8ba1-ab637dbe417d.png)\r\n> \r\n\r\ncan you extract the values for the shape from the tensor and pass them to init Reshape?\r\n> \r\n> # Layers\r\n> \r\n> for @dcslin\r\n> ## BatchNorm2d\r\n> \r\n>     * remove num_features\r\n> \r\n>     * self.allow_params = [\"scale\", \"bias\", \"running_mean\", \"running_var\"]\r\n> \r\n\r\n`running_mean` and `running_var` are not params (not updated via sgd).\r\nThey are state variables.\r\n> \r\n> ## Conv2d\r\n> \r\n>     * remove in_channels, out_channels\r\n> \r\n\r\nout_channel is required. Rename it to nb_kernels.\r\n> \r\n> ## Gemm\r\n> \r\n> In some model, the developer prefers gemm instead of linear, so we need to add gemm to Layer,\r\n\r\nok.\r\n> # Metaclass\r\n> \r\n> I've checked the metaclass carefully, but It seems I cannot use the metaclass to modify the forward function in this case. The case is, I have a graph written by ONNX, I need to write a forward by using SINGA's operator. In this case, I can call the SINGA's operator by the graph, but I cannot write a forward function automatically from the graph.\r\n\r\nWith SONNXModel, I think we do not need metaclass anymore.\r\n> \r\n> This more like the `exec` function.\r\n> \r\n> for example, I have a graph like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> graph = {\r\n>     \"op1\" : {\"inputs\":[\"a1\"], outputs:[\"a2\"]},\r\n>     \"op2\" : {\"inputs\":[\"a2\"], outputs:[\"a3\"]},\r\n> }\r\n> # what I can do\r\n> def forward(x):\r\n>     tensors = []\r\n>     for op, op_info in graph.items():\r\n>         inputs = [tensors[inp] for inp in op_info.inputs]\r\n>         outputs = op()\r\n>         for (outp, val) in zip(op_info.outputs, outputs):\r\n>             tensors[outp] = val\r\n\r\nThe code above is for SONNXModel's forward. \r\nYou just need to consider the `aux_output`\r\n> # what I cannot do by metaclass but can with exec\r\n> program = parse_graph_to_str(graph)\r\n> # 'a2=op1(a1)\\na3=op2(a2)'\r\n> exec(program)\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> So, the above forward is my current implementation.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/631177589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/631243952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/697#issuecomment-631243952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/697","id":631243952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTI0Mzk1Mg==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T05:23:34Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T05:23:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 11 alerts** and **fixes 11** when merging 495a30c3a50e8d1cff7aaf2cda3d0ff83a0bebb1 into db1846dd2c612950054f75b8125f40cd25a20f44 -

guys, @Shashankwer , @Alvinnyk , thanks for your help. \r\n\r\nBefore you start, please check this Jira, https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SINGA/issues/SINGA-509?filter=allopenissues\r\n\r\nIt lists the models which require support and for some of the models, SINGA may lack the necessary operators now. \r\n\r\nSo I hope you:\r\n\r\n1. check the Jira carefully, to see which model we can do now(I guess is: super_resolution, ResNet101_DUC_HDC, ShuffleNet_V2, ShuffleNet_V1, inception_v2, squeezenet).\r\n2. find these models in ONNX model zoo, download them and open them by a tool called [`Netron`](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron), try to understand the model and check each part refer the [IR doc](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/IR.md) of ONNX.\r\n3. try to read the code of `SingaRep` and `SingaBackend` in `python/singa/soonx.py` to understand how we parse and construct the SINGA model.\r\n4. try to read the code `examples/onnx`, to make out how we load and do the inference for a ONNX model.\r\n5. then you can try to support a model(in first point) by yourself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/631913642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/632039784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/697#issuecomment-632039784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/697","id":632039784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjAzOTc4NA==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-21T11:41:17Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T11:41:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

If we let users override set_params/get_params，the code for every layer is quite similar.\r\n```Python\r\n    def get_params(self):\r\n          self.param_names = ['W', 'b']\r\n          super(LayerName, self).get_params()\r\n    def set_params(self, **params):\r\n          self.param_names = ['W', 'b']\r\n          super(LayerName, self).set_params()\r\n```\r\nSo if users declare the names of params and states in \\_\\_init\\_\\_, we can handle them well and users just need to override three functions(\\_\\_init\\_\\_, initialize, forward). Another strategy is that we create a subclass of Tensor(named Param) and use that class to create params. In this way, we can distinguish params from all member variables.\r\n```Python\r\n     # self.W = Tensor(shape=w_shape, requires_grad=True, stores_grad=True)\r\n     self.W = Param(shape=w_shape, requires_grad=True, stores_grad=True)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/633222142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/633231970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/697#issuecomment-633231970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/697","id":633231970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzIzMTk3MA==","user":{"login":"dcslin","id":13751447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzUxNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13751447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin","html_url":"https://github.com/dcslin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcslin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-24T13:35:21Z","updated_at":"2020-05-24T13:35:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One of the caveat worth noting for user is that args of `initialize()`, `forward()` need to match exactly to `__call__()`\r\nNormally `__call__(x)` is the same as `initialize(x)`, which is ok. \r\nBut for `__call__(x, h0, c0)`, `initialize()` need to tweak a bit to be: `def initialize(self, h0, c0):` though h0, c0 is not required.\r\n\r\nfixing some code in LSTM class and testing","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/633231970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/633258563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/issues/700#issuecomment-633258563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/700","id":633258563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzI1ODU2Mw==","user":{"login":"agnesnatasya","id":44172431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTcyNDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44172431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya","html_url":"https://github.com/agnesnatasya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agnesnatasya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-24T16:46:42Z","updated_at":"2020-05-24T16:46:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, may I ask how do we get the Amazon AWS link to download the model itself?

There are two run method within ONNX, the one is by graph following the new API, I can call the `compile`, so it doesn't matter for this case. but the second, run the model directly, so I cannot use the graph.

However, when I test the PR #697 , I have three types of issues of the `test_operation.py`:\r\n\r\n# Zero-value tensors\r\n\r\nFor example, in the test case of `sum`, the value GPU tensor always is zero. But when I remove the conv2d test case, the `sum` case will be fine. It seems the conv2d layer results in the zero GPU tensor issue.\r\n\r\nThe following cases have the same problem:\r\n- sum\r\n- onehot\r\n- tile\r\n- gather\r\n- split\r\n- slice\r\n- reduce_mean\r\n- reduce_sum\r\n- globalaveragepool\r\n- gemm\r\n- prelu\r\n- less_broadcast\r\n- xor_broadcast\r\n- reciprocal\r\n- xor\r\n- not\r\n- or\r\n- selu\r\n- prelu\r\n- min_3inputs\r\n- min\r\n- shape\r\n- squeeze\r\n- max_1inputs\r\n- max_3inputs\r\n- max\r\n- reshape\r\n- mul\r\n- transpose\r\n- unsqueeze\r\n\r\n# CURAND_STATUS_LAUNCH_FAILURE\r\n\r\nan issue when I run the Conv2d with odd_padding. As you see, sometimes, I need to padding zeros from only one direction, so I write this function:\r\n```py\r\ndef handle_odd_pad_fwd(x, odd_padding):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    handle odd padding mode forward\r\n    Args:\r\n        x, the input tensor\r\n        odd_padding, the odd_padding\r\n    Returns: \r\n        tensor, the output\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    x_tensor = tensor.from_raw_tensor(x)\r\n    # (axis, left padding if True else right padding)\r\n    flags = [(2, True), (2, False), (3, True), (3, False)]\r\n    for (axis, left), pad in zip(flags, odd_padding):\r\n        if pad == 0:\r\n            continue\r\n        zeros_shape = list(x_tensor.data.shape())\r\n        zeros_shape[axis] = pad\r\n        zero_padding = np.zeros(zeros_shape).astype(np.float32)\r\n        zero_padding = tensor.Tensor(device=x.device(), data=zero_padding)\r\n        if left:\r\n            x_tensor = tensor.concatenate((zero_padding, x_tensor), axis)\r\n        else:\r\n            x_tensor = tensor.concatenate((x_tensor, zero_padding), axis)\r\n    return x_tensor.data\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it seems, when I call this func, it'd be fine if I call only one or two times, however, if I call it more times, it will report a error:\r\n\r\n> F0526 12:53:40.017063 15641 tensor_math_cuda.h:791] Check failed: status == CURAND_STATUS_SUCCESS (201 vs. 0)  CURAND_STATUS_LAUNCH_FAILURE\r\n\r\nI guess, the reason maybe it doesn't release the GPU memory in time?\r\n\r\nThe following cases have the same problem:\r\n- conv2d\r\n- pooling2d\r\n- div_broadcast\r\n\r\n# CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED\r\nThe third error msg is:\r\n> F0526 18:52:07.318809 21112 tensor_math_cuda.h:193] Error on line 193: CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED\r\n\r\nAnd the following cases have the same problem:\r\n- SeparableConv2d\r\n- mul_broadcast\r\n- sub_broadcast\r\n- add_broadcast\r\n- greater_broadcast\r\n- or_broadcast\r\n- and_broadcast\r\n- negative\r\n-
