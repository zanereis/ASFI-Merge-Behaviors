One is to say that access control lives on the web server and anything that needs access control would be done through REST. That means that if we want access control in the CLI (and we do!), we would have to re-write the CLI to go through the REST api. We clearly want to do this at some point anyway.\r\n\r\n2. Promote the access control as an Airflow-core concept. This requires refactoring access control logic out of `www_rbac` and into the core of Airflow itself. To do this, could \"stub\" the security models from FAB into `airflow/models.py`, meaning we can access permission information without loading up the Flask App. **I'm a bit confused as I couldn't find the rbac-related migrations in the repo**. This also means refactoring things that are now in `AirflowSecurityManager` as a construct that does not depend on FAB's `SecurityManager`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/387455407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/387455776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3115#issuecomment-387455776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3115","id":387455776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzQ1NTc3Ng==","user":{"login":"briandconnelly","id":658158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly","html_url":"https://github.com/briandconnelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briandconnelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-08T16:08:30Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T16:09:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@benjamingregory just did a quick test where I replaced the `Popen` part in the version in the PR with `robjects.r.source(fname)` (from rpy2).

I mentioned in the previous comment, keepalives_idle is not the cause of this issue. The setting you want is statement_timeout its a completely different setting. This thread is not really the right forum for this, it needs a new Jira ticket. I've said that twice now so maybe I should do it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime if you want to kludge it up I would try this:\r\nChange your second cursor.execute to \"SHOW statement_timeout\" to see if the setting actually took effect, perhaps return it from the operator so you can see it in xcom. The cursor should be sharing the same session so using SET to change runtime parameters should be fine across multiple calls to cursor.execute\r\n\r\n\r\nThis SO question mentions it might be a timing thing. One hacky workaround suggested is to add a time.wait in python between the calls. A better solution is to add the option parameter to the psycopg.connect method inside the postgres hook, as I mentioned in the previous comment. Its pretty straight forward for you to copy the hook and operator into plugins and modify them then use them instead of the builtins, if you need that functionality urgently.
