I wouldn't claim that this new API presents quite the same \"ergonomics\" as what we now have. I think the heart of the matter is well-expressed by your characterization: \"it replaces a nicely encapsulated API with requiring users to directly interact with a lower level API\". The question is: is that okay? Because the concern here is HTTP/networking, and I think it's at least arguable that HTTP/networking really isn't a concern of Jena. It's something that Jena itself relies on a library to achieve, and I'm suggesting that we don't really gain all that much for our users by repacking that functionality, unless it is cheap to do and there is some kind of value we can add while so doing. (And obviously, I don't think that's so much the case here.)\n\nYou're quite right that complex authN schemes (and forms-based stuff is a good example) get a little more onerous for the user with this new API. I would suggest, though, that we can mitigate that pretty well with good examples and docs. Showing people how to get their cookie and then hand around the `HttpContext` that holds it shouldn't be too hard. I can put myself on the hook to write some examples in the tests (or some other appropriate place), if it would help with your concerns?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232372364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/232373570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/151#issuecomment-232373570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/151","id":232373570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjM3MzU3MA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-13T14:31:42Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T14:31:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paulhoule There is `org.apache.http.HttpRequestInterceptor`, which I think is what HTTP Commons itself supplies for that kind of purpose.

This construction ensures prompt release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that may otherwise occur.\n> API Note:\n>    It is possible, and in fact common, for a base class to implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or instances will hold releasable resources. For code that must operate in complete generality, or when it is known that the AutoCloseable instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use try-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as Stream that support both I/O-based and non-I/O-based forms, try-with-resources blocks are in general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.\n\n@afs do you have a list of the generated warnings and maybe could attach them in a file so we can review them?\n\nIn my experience, the warnings are mostly useful hints about missing close statements. You can disable them via `@SuppressWarnings(\"resource\")` or by compiling with `-source 7`.\n\nSee the following example:\n\n```\n    private class C implements AutoCloseable{\n        @Override\n        public void close() {\n        }\n    }\n    public void a(){\n        C c = new C();\n        // warning! never closed\n        Objects.requireNonNull(c);\n    }\n    public void b(){\n        C c = new C();\n        Objects.requireNonNull(c);\n        c.close();\n        // no warning, the instance is closed\n    }\n    public C c(){\n        C c = new C();\n        Objects.requireNonNull(c);\n        // no warning, the instance is returned\n        return c;\n    }\n    public void d(){\n        C c = new C();\n        if( new Random().nextFloat() < 0.2 ){\n            // warning! not closed at this location\n            return;\n        }\n        c.close();\n    }\n```\n\nThe AutoCloseable interface should be used on any class with a `close()` method, which may need to be called. Otherwise developers are forced to use Java 6 code with manual exception handling for resource.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/235537300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/235586652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/133#issuecomment-235586652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/133","id":235586652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTU4NjY1Mg==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T13:36:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T13:36:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we're all probably familiar with he semantics of `AutoCloseable`.

track whether a promotion is possible for fully serialized, the code now checks a version number. The necessary information is available elsewhere (whether a new transaction would see the same dataset as one wanting promotion) but it's crypt and in TIM, that's in the indexes, not the transaction control in the dataset.\n\nKeeping the version is also a nice statistic to keep. \n\nThe version moves on one when a transaction commits.\n\nThat leaves one case - what to do when a writer is already active. That writer may commit later (and hence the promotion is not possible) to abort (the promotion may be possible if no other writer comes and goes). The current refuses promotion if there is an active writer on the basis that most writers commit, and abort is unusual.  Blocking maybe possible but leads to issues of what happens when another reader that tries to promote at about the same time and of a long running writer (e.g. bulk upload) causing the reader to block for a long time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/239683154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/239683694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/161#issuecomment-239683694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/161","id":239683694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTY4MzY5NA==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-14T16:48:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-14T16:48:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So ideally, it would be another writer _committing_ that would throw a switch to refuse promotion to extant transactions?

I've just had a look over some of the code and it\ncertainly wasn't obvious in that look that the query\nends up closing the result iterator. I could have missed\nsomething easily. But if there's a problem there its\nmore general than the issue with QueryInterDistinct and\ndeserves its own JIRA? \n\nBut in any case cancel() is [typically] called from the \ntimeout thread, so it would surely be thread-unsafe for \nthe cancel methods to go calling close() while the query\nthread might be working on shared state, independently\nof worries about close() always being called.\n\n[A look at the codebase shows that there are three\nclasses with requestSubCancel() closing, not cancelling,\nother iterators:\n\n```\nAnstractIterHashJoin\nQueryIterDistinctReduced\nQueryIter2LoopOnLeft\n```\n\nwhich suggests these should be looked at in case there\nmight be a similar cancellation problem]\n\nHow should we make progress on this?\n\nChris\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/244397940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/244420213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/167#issuecomment-244420213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/167","id":244420213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDQyMDIxMw==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-02T16:16:02Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T16:16:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There
