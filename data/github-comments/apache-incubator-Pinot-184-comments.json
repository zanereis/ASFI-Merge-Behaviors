MutableIndex implementations do not fulfil this contract, so MutableIndex cannot implement IndexCreator. I would say that the confusion is not due to MutableIndex implementing IndexReader but not IndexCreator. The thing that creates the confusion is the name of IndexCreator. Given that IndexCreator is the interface that is used to create offline indexes, it should be called something like `OfflineIndexCreator`. I'm sure if that was the actual name, reviewers wouldn't be confused.\r\n\r\nWe can change the name of IndexCreator in this or another PR if you think it would be better. I would prefer to do that in another PR in order to do not merge the changes from a rename

Some tests always get out of memory in GitHub Actions, while my amd pc and my M1 laptop run them without problems, even when running with `mvn -P github-actions`. Given that I cannot reproduce the problem locally, it is being very difficult to fix the problem. Any help there would be helpful.\r\n\r\n> Later on we should move to Foreign Memory when stable support is available ?\r\n\r\nI guess we should decide what we want to do with that. We can either:\r\n- Wait until Foreign Memory API is production ready and stay in Java 11 meanwhile.\r\n   - Versions on which we could run Pinot: [11, 15] and [22, ...). \r\n       - Assuming that Foreign Memory API is released in Java 22.\r\n   - Advantage: we will only use proven and stable apis. \r\n   - Disadvantages: But it implies that we would need to either run with Java 11 until Java 23 or we would need to use non LTS versions.\r\n- Support preview of Foreign Memory API: \r\n   - Versions on which we could run Pinot: [11, 15] and [21, ...).\r\n   - Advantage: We would support Java 21 if running with --enable-preview\r\n   - Disadvantage: \r\n      - If OpenJDK decides to add more breaking changes in Java 22, we would need to maintain different versions of the code.\r\n      - We would need to run with --preview-enable, which is not intended to be executed in production.\r\n- Use our own library on top of Unsafe\r\n   - Versions on which we could run Pinot: [11, ...).\r\n   - Advantages:\r\n      - In Java [11, 15] we can choose to use LArray or Unsafe\r\n      - In Java [16, 20] we can only use Unsafe\r\n      - In Java 21 we can use Unsafe or run with --enable-preview and use Foreign Memory API\r\n      - Once Foreign Memory API is released, we could always use Foreign Memory API\r\n  - Disadvantages:\r\n      - We need to maintain the Unsafe library. \r\n         - Errors there may kill the JVM with segmentation faults. Details may depend on CPU architectures and OS. For example, mmap needs to be page aligned in Linux (otherwise segmentation fault kills the JVM).\r\n         - Unsafe methods do change between major JVM versions.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to have the latest version passing the test by the end of this week (although as said above, I'm blocked with some tests I cannot reproduce). To have a library on top of Unsafe is a requirement if we want to run with Java 17, but whether or not Pinot recommends to do so is something we need to decide.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1556883919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1557189891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10771#issuecomment-1557189891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10771","id":1557189891,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5c0NUD","user":{"login":"soumitra-st","id":127247229,"node_id":"U_kgDOB5WjfQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127247229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st","html_url":"https://github.com/soumitra-st","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumitra-st/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-22T13:07:01Z","updated_at":"2023-05-22T13:07:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Let's also make sure the existing cluster with case insensitive = false won't be automatically turned on after this change.\r\n\r\n@xiangfu0 , one question here:\r\nCurrent code is:\r\n    _brokerConf.getProperty(Helix.ENABLE_CASE_INSENSITIVE_KEY, false)\r\n    ||\r\n    _brokerConf.getProperty(Helix.DEPRECATED_ENABLE_CASE_INSENSITIVE_KEY, false);\r\n\r\nWhich means, by default Pinot is case sensitive, and if any of the two properties (Helix.ENABLE_CASE_INSENSITIVE_KEY, Helix.DEPRECATED_ENABLE_CASE_INSENSITIVE_KEY) are set to true, Pinot becomes case insensitive.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible changes:\r\n1.

I think we should avoid doing downtime rebalance when segments are not guaranteed to be persisted in deep store. We don't want to always check download url though because that might be costly. We can check that only when peer download is enabled. We can also consider adding a flag to skip this check in case the cluster runs into a weird state and we have to perform a downtime rebalance even though it can cause data
