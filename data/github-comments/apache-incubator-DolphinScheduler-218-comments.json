The access group is responsible for the data access of the ods layer project, and the model group is responsible for dwd, dws, and dim. Layer project development, the upper application group is responsible for the market development of the ads layer, ods openly shares dwd, dws, dim (depending on ods), but is not allowed to be modified, dwd, dws, dim open and share the ads layer (depending on the model layer), but it is not allowed to be modified. There is a dependency on the project workflow. Different groups need to control permissions for different layers.\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nHi. I have a problem when I submit a SQL task. My SQL have a dynamic table name. Because it's a partitioned table by postgresql.\r\n\r\nThe task definition like below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12369169/161258187-13c7eaa7-b407-4f3b-89f4-4fbdec22d64a.png)\r\n\r\nThe declare SQL is:\r\n```sql\r\n\r\nWITH \r\nr00 AS (\r\n SELECT coalesce(rb_build_agg(cast(id as int)), rb_build('{}')) AS id_bitmap\r\n FROM ads.t_dmp_test_user\r\n WHERE (id not in (1,2,3) AND (part_day BETWEEN TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE-3000, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND '2022-03-30' OR jkx_userid is not null))\r\n)\r\n INSERT INTO ads.t_dmp_test_tag_${abc} (tag_name,tag_id,tag_value,bit_list,etl_time,part_day) \r\n SELECT '付费用户',123,'七日内付费用户',r00.id_bitmap,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD') FROM r00\r\n ON CONFLICT(tag_name, tag_value, part_day)\r\n DO UPDATE SET (tag_name,tag_id,tag_value,bit_list,etl_time,part_day)=ROW(excluded.*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I got a error when the task executed. The error info like below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12369169/161259409-96634b17-a8af-45a3-8f18-e69690c316d0.png)\r\n\r\nThe error message:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] 2022-04-01 19:27:05.672 [TaskLogInfo- -
