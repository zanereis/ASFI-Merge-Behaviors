The initial version of WebSocket Endpoint won't be for the standing queries. Web Socket would serve as one additional interface ( than existing REST API way) for an external system to connect and query in Pinot, here we save the connection establishment time for each HTTP request . The client is expected to give any queries as we currently have with REST API.\r\n2. The additional use cases of making it support standing queries to period response/return after a change in data ( with a periodic check at pinot ) can be added once the underlying web socket interface is there. This would be a nice feature to support at Pinot as it removes the work at the client system ( particularly data viz. applications ) to periodically call Pinot.\r\n3. For incremental results bounded to standing queries, we can this support once point 2 is made.  Here we can utilise the time field of real-time data flowing in & a WebSocket connection at the pinot broker end can maintain the state of the last timestamp it served.\r\n\r\n@atris Please add if I am missing any points.

qq\r\nI was going through the [SqlExplain code](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql/SqlExplain.java), and it looks like we have the option to get Physical plan of the query by using the option `WITH IMPLEMENTATION` in `Explain Plan for` SQL statement itself.\r\n\r\nOne such example is the like below.\r\n```\r\nEXPLAIN Plan WITH IMPLEMENTATION for SELECT MIN(AirTime), MAX(AirlineID), SUM(ArrDelay), AVG(ArrDelayMinutes), Year, Quarter \r\nFROM airlineStats\r\nWHERE Year = 2014\r\nGROUP BY Year, Quarter \r\nORDER BY Year, Quarter DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the implementation perspective, we have to add the [code here](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-query-planner/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/query/QueryEnvironment.java#L196) in-case if we get the flag true from [SqlExplain's](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql/SqlExplain.java#L145) `withImplementation()` method.\r\n\r\nDo we want to use this option instead of implementing `EXPLAIN PHYSICAL PLAN`?\r\n\r\nAlso, if we are going with the implementation of `EXPLAIN PHYSICAL PLAN FOR` instead, do we want to support some options like `EXPLAIN PHYSICAL PLAN AS JSON` or similar?  and, also just confirming from the v1 engine perspective the response would be same for `EXPLAIN PLAN` and `EXPLAIN PHYSICAL PLAN`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1620887886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1620979318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11030#issuecomment-1620979318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11030","id":1620979318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5gni52","user":{"login":"s0nskar","id":11391128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzkxMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11391128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar","html_url":"https://github.com/s0nskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0nskar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T03:49:43Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T03:49:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

This is incorrect because after modifying the value it is no longer the min/max value and can cause wrong result.

We guard against any newly ingested record having all null comparison columns[1], so by the time we reach `compareTo` the values being compared would \"at worst\" be `<defaultValue>` of the previously ingested record and the non-null value (i.e. non-defaultValue) of the newly ingested record. Such a comparison would have the same result as the current implementation (current implementation checks if the previous record's value for the same comparison index is null and if so accepts the new record as a valid upsert). \r\n\r\nAll that said though, if we don't encode nullness then we lose the ability to perform valuable queries like \"show me all records that have null `comparisonColumnX`\" (i.e. \"show me all records which have never had data written by a producer that uses `comparisonColumnX`).\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/egalpin/pinot/blob/68fdfa4a12926c7ce45dadc6a86d973ce5ff3669/pinot-segment-local/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/segment/local/indexsegment/mutable/MutableSegmentImpl.java#L597 ( -> this method has move, I think as of https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10703)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1622295892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1622690187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11031#issuecomment-1622690187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11031","id":1622690187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5guEmL","user":{"login":"abhioncbr","id":1076944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr","html_url":"https://github.com/abhioncbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T23:42:47Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T23:42:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As per the logs and command, zookeeper is running as the background process.

IIRC, the limitation is introduced by the `PropertiesConfiguration` (from Apache Common library). Maybe we can work-around this limitation\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointer. I was digging around the `PropertiesConfiguration`, and here are my understandings.\r\n- By default, PropertiesConfiguration has the ` = `(leading and trailing whitespace) as a key,value separator. As per the [doc](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/userguide_v1.10/howto_properties.html), we can either use the `setSeparator()` or `setGlobalSeparator()`\r\n- values having comma`,` is considered an array while reading, but we can escape the comma by adding `\\\\` in front of the comma.\r\n\r\nLastly, here is the sample function for understanding the issue\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args)\r\n      throws ConfigurationException {\r\n    PropertiesConfiguration properties =\r\n        new PropertiesConfiguration(new File(\"test\"));\r\n    String testValueWithWhitespace = \"  aaa   \";\r\n    properties.setProperty(\"a\", testValueWithWhitespace);\r\n\r\n    String testValueWithComma = \"a\\\\,a\\\\,a\";\r\n    properties.setProperty(\"a1\", testValueWithComma);\r\n\r\n    properties.save();\r\n\r\n    String readValue = (String)properties.getProperty(\"a\");\r\n    String readValue1 = (String)properties.getProperty(\"a1\");\r\n    System.out.printf(\"#%s#%n\", readValue);\r\n    System.out.printf(\"#%s#%n\", readValue1);\r\n    Assert.equals(testValueWithWhitespace, readValue);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe property file content for the above is as follows.\r\n```\r\na =           aaa   \r\na1 = a\\,a\\,a\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't see the issue using the value with whitespace based on the above example, and for comma we can add the escape character. Please share your opinion.
