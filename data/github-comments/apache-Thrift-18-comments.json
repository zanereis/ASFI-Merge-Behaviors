I run the node library through browserify which works but by default produces a much larger glob of javascript than I really need, due to all of the thrift node components requiring that file which pulls in all of the other components whether I need them or not (eg I don't want to pull in TCompactProtocol or TFramedTransport etc if I'm just using TXHRTransport and TBinaryProtocol in the browser).  At the moment I'm using some local edits to reduce what gets included by `require('thrift')` but IIRC the last time I looked at it, I came to the conclusion that the `require('thrift')` might not be needed at all (i.e., the modules that it aggregates can just be included explicitly and individually as needed).  I would make code in the compiler possibly a bit more complicated but it could be worth the effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/279125320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/279131332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1185#issuecomment-279131332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1185","id":279131332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTEzMTMzMg==","user":{"login":"gadLinux","id":233204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzIwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux","html_url":"https://github.com/gadLinux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gadLinux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-11T09:04:54Z","updated_at":"2017-02-11T09:04:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's fix it latter, please.
