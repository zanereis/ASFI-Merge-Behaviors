anyone else struggling with this, I've written a function for the position callback that solves this. It first attempts to place the tool-tip to the top right of the mouse position. If it overflows to the right, it flips it to the left. If it then overflows to the left, it places it a fixed distance from the left edge of the window (since there's no better placement on the X axis at this point). And vice versa for top and bottom placement, with the fallback here placing it a fixed distance from the top edge of the window. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The efficiency of this can probably be improved\r\n- Feel free to make a pull request incorporating this into the default tool-tip position logic.
