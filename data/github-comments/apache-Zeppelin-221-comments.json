As a Maven project I expect that `mvn clean install` should do everything that is needed. But it fails because some Maven modules cannot find other modules. One has to `mvn install -DskipTests` first and then execute `mvn test` in a second pass.\r\n\r\nLast Thursday there was a [meeting](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/FJBnCw) with Apache Infra where we discussed how we could use Linux ARM64 build nodes for Github Actions CI. The idea is to use self-hosted Linux ARM64 runner + custom Github Action runner with security enhancements to prevent abuses from contributors. Also see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/GitHub+-+self-hosted+runners\r\nThis way Zeppelin will continue using just Github Actions as a CI.\r\nI'll let you know once I have a working POC!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/968622440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/968630934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4243#issuecomment-968630934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4243","id":968630934,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM45vCKW","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T08:08:28Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T08:08:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @martin-g ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/968630934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/968711084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4189#issuecomment-968711084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4189","id":968711084,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM45vVus","user":{"login":"rickchengx","id":38122586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTIyNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38122586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx","html_url":"https://github.com/rickchengx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T09:45:14Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T09:45:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zjffdu Sorry for the late response, I was busy with my school things.
