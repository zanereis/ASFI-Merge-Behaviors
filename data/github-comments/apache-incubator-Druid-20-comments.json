Fangjin,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the answer, I realize indeed we might have issues in our usage of Druid but still, aren't realtime nodes supposed to ingest data in realtime and answer clients' queries ? Because here this design is not respected and there is absolutely no logic behind throttling ingestion to the point of DISABLING ingestion completely on a group of kafka partitions.\n\nI still feel there is a serious design problem in the way Druid ingests its data through Kafka:\nif the ingestion is being throttled to save the node from crashing, why even claim ownership over partitions other nodes could trivially read from ? It only blocks other consumers from reading data they could ingest, triggering latency issues and ultimately forcing us to reindex data at a later point (meaning realtime data becomes incorrect, incomplete).\n\nThanks for addressing this issue, I'm sure you can see this is not a behaviour that can be acceptable.\n\nAnd if you still think this is a correct behavior and you feel throttling ingestion is the way to go, then I suggest to throttle the whole process, not just the reading part but also the Kafka rebalancing part, that way, nodes not restarted have a chance to continue ingesting data while late nodes can catch up with their handing off process.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/98694593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/98724931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1291#issuecomment-98724931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1291","id":98724931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NzI0OTMx","user":{"login":"KenjiTakahashi","id":431488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/431488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi","html_url":"https://github.com/KenjiTakahashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KenjiTakahashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-04T14:19:08Z","updated_at":"2015-05-04T14:19:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, I think I've been misunderstood a bit here.

The approach of splitting out the offsets and values into two compressed sub-indices looks good and should fit in fine with the normal access patterns. The drastic jump in error bounds for the largest compressions are a bit concerning, but microbenchmarks in this case may not be indicative of actual query performance and query results would be very handy for comparison. Additionally, this may affect over-committed historical nodes (more disk than memory) drastically differently than under-committed historical nodes (more memory than disk) when swapping in pages from disk, which is much more difficult to test.
