\r\n\r\n抱歉， 我用翻译软件和您交流的，因为英语不好，又希望和各位交流下想法，请原谅我使用中文。\r\n\r\n我的问题是这样的，我的SQL中没有分片字段，分片规则是按照我自己维护的路由映射关系加载到程序的全局中定义好的，比如数据库A，路由至库A_10002，表也如此，同时，大部分表是不需要分表的，基于此背景，应用sharding-jdbc后发现下面两个问题：\r\n\r\n1. 不需要分片的表也需要定义，否则当SQL中只有未分片的表时，只会使用默认数据源，可是我需要把他路由到分库上\r\n\r\n2. 我必须AOP拦截所有SQL操作，否则没有设置Hint的时机，不设置Hint就无法触发HintShardingAlgorithm的回调。分片值我也是随便塞的，\r\n\r\n其实我需要的只是每次执行SQL，sharding-jdbc都能回调下，我会返回事实库名称，SQL解析到设置分片的表时也能回调下，我会返回事实表名 即可。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/668560531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/668562789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6606#issuecomment-668562789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6606","id":668562789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODU2Mjc4OQ==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-04T12:21:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T12:21:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi
