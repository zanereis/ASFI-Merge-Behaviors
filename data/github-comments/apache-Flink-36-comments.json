The streaming core is undergoing heavy changes, the windowing may be reworked in the near future, and there are plans to use managed memory for window buffer contents.\n\nI am not sure how putting this into a separate library helps a future refactoring of windowing. Most of the median code is inside the new PreReducers, so it is probably already separated from the rest of the code as well as it can be.\n(Also, if you are worried about bloating the API for the users, I don't think median would hurt in that respect either: the function of a method named \"median\" should be pretty clear to the

Otherwise, you would take the exact code in the DataSet removeVertices and duplicate it in difference. That's not very practical IMO.\n\nAlso, it may occur that a user has a DataSet of elements to remove. An extra removeVertices won't really hurt then, would it? \n\nBut if you have suggestions on how to improve this, we are more than eager to hear about them :)\n\n-Andra\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112099290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112104910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/834#issuecomment-112104910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/834","id":112104910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjEwNDkxMA==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-15T15:20:55Z","updated_at":"2015-06-15T15:20:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have a funny feeling that this might backfire.

I checked with a local jobmanager (using \"start-local.sh\"), that seemed to work. Maybe you can check if it works with a remote cluster as well?\n\nConcerning automated tests, its somewhat tricky. The jar has to be sent to the remote execution and at the same time be available in the shell. You cant add jars from inside the shell (scala 2.10 bug:https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6502), only at startup with an additional parameter (see bash script: start-scala-shell.sh).\nIf I try to invoke the start-scala-shell.sh script from inside java/scala and redirect the std out I only get half of the output (everything till the actual scala shell starts).\n\nIs it possible to add an additional classpath in maven for the tests? Then at least I could write a test, that checks if the jars are shipped to the remote environment..\nOr do you have another suggestion maybe?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112477088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/112494219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/843#issuecomment-112494219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/843","id":112494219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMjQ5NDIxOQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-16T16:45:59Z","updated_at":"2015-06-16T16:45:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great
