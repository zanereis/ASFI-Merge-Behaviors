@junwen12221 ,\r\nGlad to see your explanation. \r\n\r\n> Calcite JDBC Driver provides some default advanced features including lattice,Materialized Views.Or you can use\r\n\r\nI suppose these features are far away from us since currently we just focus on the adaptor, rules optimization, and the conversion between parsed result and `relNode`. Nevertheless, `Frameworks` is a handy tool including `parser`, `validator` and `RelConverter`.\r\n\r\n@guimingyue  @junwen12221 \r\n\r\nSpeaking of `Adaptor` (Federated SQL), I suggest we implement the interface `ProjectableFilterableTable` initially to run through the whole process well. Next, we can import `TranslatableTable` for furthermore optimization. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to `Query Optimization`, from my perspective, there are two aspects for our consideration (Give it a notice here @guimingyue ).\r\n\r\n- Apply some of `CoreRules` and `EnumerableRules` to perform logical transformations on relational expressions\r\n- Implement `TranslatableTable` to register custom rules (Like CoreRules)\r\n\r\n**Notice**, The conversion from the SQLStatement of ShardingSphere parser to SqlNode of Calcite is a prerequisite for broad SQL support.\r\n\r\nPlease be free to share your views on the content above. : ) \r\n\r\nBTW, I updated [federatedSQL](https://github.com/tristaZero/federatedSQL) project with a non-generated-code converter to avoid `janino debug`, welcome your check-out. Moreover, I am going to post a summary or blog about `How does Calcite handle a SQL?` afterward. But...please leave me some more time...\r\n\r\n@guimingyue How are you going? If you want to try to write something about query optimization, our federatedSQL repo is the right place, I guess. :)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/740564112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/740573548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3185#issuecomment-740573548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3185","id":740573548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDU3MzU0OA==","user":{"login":"fyuan1030","id":38123832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTIzODMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38123832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030","html_url":"https://github.com/fyuan1030","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fyuan1030/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-08T11:51:08Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T11:51:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hello，I want to know can I just use apollo as config  center?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/740573548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/740589599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8284#issuecomment-740589599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8284","id":740589599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MDU4OTU5OQ==","user":{"login":"guimingyue","id":1716196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTYxOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1716196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue","html_url":"https://github.com/guimingyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guimingyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-08T12:26:01Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T12:28:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tristaZero \r\nSorry for the late reply, I have created two converter class for converting SQLStatement to calcite SqlNode and then to calcite RelNode.

@tristaZero,\r\n\r\nMy situation is the same with @marktrue. It happened only when query `show tables;`.\r\n\r\nI really want to help figuring out the reason why it happened, but I don't know how to set a breakpoint to the file in apache-shardingsphere-5.0.0-alpha-shardingsphere-proxy-bin in IntelliJ IDEA. Cause the proxy is started with start.sh in apache-shardingsphere-5.0.0-alpha-shardingsphere-proxy-bin/bin.\r\n\r\nIf I need to start the proxy from the source code in IDE, what can I do to start the proxy? And what can I do to config the proxy?\r\n\r\nI pulled the latest source code of shardingsphere-proxy, but I can't find the place to config the program and the way to start the proxy.\r\n\r\nI searched Google, but I still can't find any useful information.
