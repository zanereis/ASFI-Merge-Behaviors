generally looks good to me.\r\nAnd a couple of ideas came up.\r\n\r\n1. If you need a notification for non-blocking activation, why don't you use just blocking activation?\r\nIs this because the action runs for a long time, and the caller needs to work on other activities until the activation is over?\r\n\r\n2. I feel like, we need a feature similar to a callback.\r\nIf so, I am inclined to have this functionality out of the platform.\r\nInstead of managing all stuff for notification, we can let users have their own notification channels.\r\nThe platform can have a feature to call or send an event to the given channel.\r\n\r\nFor example, a user can register his own notification callback URL or Kafka endpoints with a topic.\r\nOnce activations are over, OpenWhisk will call the URL or send an event to the given Kafka.\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can minimize the scope to manage.\r\nThe failover or scalability of the channel would be managed in the scope of the external notification channel by users rather than the scope of OpenWhisk.\r\n\r\nHow do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/707097804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/707099938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4133#issuecomment-707099938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4133","id":707099938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzA5OTkzOA==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T12:49:28Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T12:49:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@autthapone

I don't know what the approval process for such a substantial feature like this should be, but I will approve once one or two more people have gone through this. I'm impressed you were able to implement a feature like this and maintain backwards compatibility without the code getting out of control. This is a feature we've wanted for years.\r\n\r\nOne thing to add about backwards compatibility, could we create a migration script that adds version `@0.0.1` to the db and version view for every non-versioned action. Once upgraded, we would like to do something like that so that we don't have a mixture of the two types of data to deal with. And if such a script is provided, we can remove the backwards compatibility support in a subsequent release to keep the codebase clean and direct operators to use the script once upgraded past this commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/710666516/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/711360838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/2163#issuecomment-711360838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2163","id":711360838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTM2MDgzOA==","user":{"login":"carlosibm","id":60844296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODQ0Mjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60844296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosibm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosibm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-18T18:27:10Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T18:27:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I hit this as well.

I've stopped the installer (with Ctrl C) and ran it again. It took little time and it seems to have worked. Output below. I can access the playground at `http://172.17.0.1:3232/playground/ui/index.html`.\r\n\r\nI hope I don't encounter errors in the future because of the issue of the 96% loop.\r\n\r\nAlso there's another issue, but I think it's minor. I have firefox and google chrome. The installer couldn't open the link in any of them. It couldn't run firefox as root. I had to execute the installation command as root, because if I don't, docker outputs an error and the installer fails. The installer didn't search for google chrome.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo ./gradlew core:standalone:bootRun 2>&1 | tee OpenWhiskInstallerTerminalOutput.txt\r\n[sudo] password for mono: \r\nBuild using Scala 2.12\r\nScala sub-project 'gatling_tests' doesn't have Scoverage applied and will be ignored in parent project aggregation\r\n> Task :common:scala:compileJava NO-SOURCE\r\n> Task :common:scala:compileScala UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :common:scala:processResources UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :common:scala:classes UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :common:scala:jar UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:invoker:compileJava NO-SOURCE\r\n> Task :core:invoker:compileScala UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:invoker:processResources UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:invoker:classes UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:invoker:jar UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:controller:compileJava NO-SOURCE\r\n> Task :core:controller:compileScala UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:controller:processResources UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:controller:classes UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:controller:jar UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :tools:admin:compileJava NO-SOURCE\r\n> Task :tools:admin:compileScala UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :tools:admin:processResources UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :tools:admin:classes UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :tools:admin:jar UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:standalone:compileJava NO-SOURCE\r\n> Task :core:standalone:compileScala UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:standalone:generateGitProperties\r\n> Task :core:standalone:copyGWActions\r\n> Task :core:standalone:copyGrafanaConfig\r\n> Task :core:standalone:copySwagger UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:standalone:processResources UP-TO-DATE\r\n> Task :core:standalone:classes\r\n\r\n> Task :core:standalone:bootRun\r\n\r\n        ____      ___                   _    _ _     _     _           \r\n       /\\   \\    / _ \\ _ __   ___ _ __ | |  | | |__ (_)___| | __       \r\n  /\\  /__\\   \\  | | | | '_ \\ / _ \\ '_ \\| |  | | '_ \\| / __| |/ /       \r\n /  \\____ \\  /  | |_| | |_) |  __/ | | | |/\\| | | | | \\__ \\   <        \r\n \\   \\  /  \\/    \\___/| .__/ \\___|_| |_|__/\\__|_| |_|_|___/_|\\_\\       \r\n  \\___\\/ tm           |_|                                              \r\n                                                                       \r\nGit Commit: cb16450, Build Date: 2020-11-05T20:58:15+0200\r\n================================================================================\r\nRunning pre flight checks ...\r\n\r\nLocal Host Name: 172.17.0.1\r\nLocal Internal Name: 172.17.0.1\r\n\r\n[  OK   ] 'docker' cli found.

As noted in the discussion above, if the invoker id existing for another name; it will delete that mapping before reassigning to the new name.\r\n2. You can't overwrite with an invoker id that doesn't fit into the size of the invoker pool. i.e. if the invoker pool is size 2, I can't overwrite with id 2. only 0 or 1.\r\n3. When dynamically assigning a new id, it now does so based on the number of invoker nodes in the zookeeper list rather than the atomic count. That way when reassigning things, it will always stay in sync with the true size of invokers if assigning a new id dynamically. This should maintain atomicity because it still uses the atomic counter as a lock and will re get the invokers size if it doesn't acquire the lock and would then include the new invoker that had the lock at the time. This is important to do because obviously it better tracks the true size of your invoker fleet and is important for allowing overwriting. For example, we want to move invokers 25-30 to invokers 0-5. When we do that, 25-30 would no longer exist; but our counter is still at 31 so if we add a new node it will be 31 leaving 25-30 forever empty. With this change, after moving 25-30 to 0-5 it will recognize there's actually only 25 invokers so when we add a new node it will correctly use 25 for the new node.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/726353524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/727085970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/5024#issuecomment-727085970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5024","id":727085970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzA4NTk3MA==","user":{"login":"bdoyle0182","id":11879547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODc5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11879547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182","html_url":"https://github.com/bdoyle0182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T23:38:55Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T23:38:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested this out in one of our regions.
