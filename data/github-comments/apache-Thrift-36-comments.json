I think the `CMakeLists.txt` inside a thrift subdirectory may be confusing?\r\n\r\nIn any case, here is a slightly extensive `CMakeLists.txt` for a hypothetical library `CMakeThriftTest` that has a source file `src/CMakeThriftTest.cc` and a Thrift IDL file `thrift/TestAPI.thrift`. The thrift compiler checks are just there for the sake of demonstration and are not mandatory, but they test the compiler execution and may be helpful to check the compiler version.\r\n\r\nThe important part is, thanks to cmake package configuration, this example should work without `FindThrift.cmake` script, as long as cmake has the installation path of thrift in its search path (but this is anyways required for the prerequisites).\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)\r\nproject(CMakeThriftTest)\r\n\r\nfind_package(thrift REQUIRED)\r\n\r\n# Checking if a thrift compiler is available.

It could be a separate project in tutorial/cmake that we explicitly build separately AFTER we do a cmake build and cmake install in CI.\r\n\r\nAs for the cmake itself:\r\n\r\n1. find_package is supposed to handle versioning requirements.  I would not expect to have to run the compiler with --version and capture the output and regex it in the consuming cmake module.\r\n\r\n2. It would be \"better\" (but understandably perhaps too difficult) to know the resulting generated file structure and make it part of dependencies.  So maybe that's just the way it is (that's how I have done it in the past).\r\n\r\n3. I would expect any integration to provide a macro for \"thrift_compile\" instead of add_custom_command (I would wrap that in a macro myself in my own project).\r\n\r\n4. Generated code should go into CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR, however there is a directive indicating private headers live in ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/gen-cpp, so that looks like a mistake.  CMake out-of-tree builds should succeed even if the source tree is read-only.\r\n\r\nThanks - good to see cmake action in the project.

However I feel it would be good to proceed with this PR independent of the usage example. The important part is that the PR adds the required steps to allow inclusion of thrift without the need for a (manually crafted, explicitly added) find-script. This will significantly help downstream packages. Since the use of `find_package(thrift)` is almost trivial, I think the PR adds its value independently of the usage example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/457816171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/457816314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1714#issuecomment-457816314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1714","id":457816314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzgxNjMxNA==","user":{"login":"cyyever","id":17618148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjE4MTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17618148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever","html_url":"https://github.com/cyyever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyyever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-26T09:22:25Z","updated_at":"2019-01-26T09:36:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR is same with https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1713.\r\nGiven that the support for GNU autotools is not dropped,I decided to add the cmake generated header to the source tree.And the header was changed a little to avoid errors in gcc/clang.\r\nAnd I only added the macro to problematic locations.
