with regards to the comments on the hasher.\r\n\r\nThe existing library has tests for some really odd scenarios. I still don't understand why you would want to upload a generator to an S3 bucket?\r\n\r\nI do understand why you would want to consume a buffered reader, like a `file` object, or a `StringIO` or `BytesIO` stream. That makes total sense. The existing drivers have checks in them assume that the storage base class will return a hash. Since there were 3 callbacks in the past, which implemented seperate logic for the hashing, one supported file_path. I understand that, one supported iterators (don't understand but it's existing functionality so I don't want to break back compat) and the other supported streams, but there wasn't really any testing for it.\r\n\r\nThis base class still needs significant refactoring, so far I have an account for GCP which I'm using to test file streams, but I need more integration scenarios. #970 should provide a good baseline of existing functionality and allow for better refactoring.

coroutines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/290983001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/291007091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1016#issuecomment-291007091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1016","id":291007091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTAwNzA5MQ==","user":{"login":"pquentin","id":42327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin","html_url":"https://github.com/pquentin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-02T19:01:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-02T19:01:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think trying to add async support to libcloud is a worthwile goal. Unfortunately, you did not really accomplish much here. On the API side, to use the async version of libcloud, users will still need to use the `await` keyword, so avoiding users to write `list_nodes_async` (or something) is not a huge win. On the internal side, [the world is still divided in two](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/) because you *still* have two versions of `list_nodes`.\r\n\r\nThe real problem now is: how do you make this manageable internally in libcloud? If you look at the call tree of a method like \"list_nodes\", what it's going to do is to make network calls around leaves of the call tree. Each such call has to be in an async function to avoid blocking the event loop, and each caller of those functions has to be an async function too! Everything is being tainted. [You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/07/19/you-wanted-banana/). The very nature of libcloud makes this a real challenge. Try to get an async list_nodes to work without changing any other functions, and look at all the code you had to modify/copy paste. How do you keep the two versions in sync?\r\n\r\nOne option is to use the approach of https://github.com/njsmith/h11 or https://effect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html which totally decouples the I/O from the business logic, which allows to use different wrappers. But that basically requires rewriting libcloud, introducing lots of bugs.\r\n\r\nAnother one is to write fully async code and provide sync wrappers. This is probably not a good idea because the library now needs to introduce its own event loop and it's not the away asyncio is supposed to work in Python. There are probably [other, more subtle concerns](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pfxteam/2012/04/13/should-i-expose-synchronous-wrappers-for-asynchronous-methods/) (C# had a lot more time to think about this.) And I'm not even talking about Python 2 support, which does not have an usable event loop. (Trollius is not maintained and should not be used right now.)\r\n\r\nSee this requests issue for more discussions about this (https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/1390). No wonder no popular library I know of currently offers async/sync support. It's much easier to actually write two different libraries. But that's probably not a good idea for libcloud to divide the eyeballs even more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/291007091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/291028980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1016#issuecomment-291028980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1016","id":291028980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTAyODk4MA==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-03T01:09:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T01:09:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll try and get those points in order,\r\n\r\n1. the transport isn't async - correct. I'm going to raise a few pull requests with different design patterns and ask the community to discuss pro's and con's. We'll see the benefits and performance gains from the 2nd pattern. I don't completely believe the transport needs to be a coroutine \r\n\r\n2. \"you know you're returning a future\", yes- that was kind of the point, the idea here is that the user can build a coroutine which runs a sequence of steps against the API and then wait for the event loop to close out.\r\n\r\n3. On the API side, to use the async version of libcloud, users will still need to use the await keyword- exactly. I work on another C# library, it's common practice now for a C#.NET package to expose all Async methods as awaitable to give the caller control over which Task API to use, they can just await it, then can use a Thread pool, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nAll the logic inside the drivers is about manipulating request and response dictionaries, authenticating APIs and sometimes doing list comprehensions and model projections, whether the call to the underlying API is the coroutine or the method itself is a coroutine won't make a difference since the method will still need to await the response. \r\n\r\nIn the `requests-futures` example, I want to copy a similar principle but apply it in a context manager, the context manager in this PR changes a NodeDrivers core methods to become coroutine's.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom requests_futures.sessions import FuturesSession\r\n\r\nsession = FuturesSession()\r\n# first request is started in background\r\nfuture_one = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')\r\n# second requests is started immediately\r\nfuture_two = session.get('http://httpbin.org/get?foo=bar')\r\n# wait for the first request to complete, if it hasn't already\r\nresponse_one = future_one.result()\r\nprint('response one status: {0}'.format(response_one.status_code))\r\nprint(response_one.content)\r\n# wait for the second request to complete, if it hasn't already\r\nresponse_two = future_two.result()\r\nprint('response two status: {0}'.format(response_two.status_code))\r\nprint(response_two.content)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/291028980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/291029586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1016#issuecomment-291029586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1016","id":291029586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTAyOTU4Ng==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-03T01:17:09Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T01:17:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It would make sense to write down some use cases and demonstrate them using each design pattern.

Am I missing something?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/292445879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/292446090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1016#issuecomment-292446090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1016","id":292446090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjQ0NjA5MA==","user":{"login":"pquentin","id":42327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin","html_url":"https://github.com/pquentin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pquentin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-07T05:39:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T05:58:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tonybaloney to make things clear, I'm not saying I don't want to use an async context manager.
