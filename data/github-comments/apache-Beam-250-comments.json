wrong.\r\nIt turns out that the current implementation uses the same filename for each parallel instance writing the data. That is why the test fails with file already exists.\r\n\r\nWith the overwrite option you therfor get a different error that effectively says \"bad file\" which is simply caused by the threads obliterating the data written by the others.\r\n\r\nMy current assessment is that the \"numShards and \"shardNameTemplate\" construct (as seen in TextIO) needs to be added here as well to make it work.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/326533743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/326546349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3779#issuecomment-326546349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3779","id":326546349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjU0NjM0OQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-01T10:23:22Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T10:23:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
