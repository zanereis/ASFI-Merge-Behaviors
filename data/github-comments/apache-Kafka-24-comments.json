Though I maybe wrong.. Here is the order of functions called inside class `KafkaController` that lead to `LeaderAndIsrRequest` with incremented `leaderEpoch`:\n\n```\nonControllerFailover()\nmaybeTriggerPartitionReassignment()\ninitiateReassignReplicasForTopicPartition()\nonPartitionReassignment()\nupdateLeaderEpochAndSendRequest()\nupdateLeaderEpoch()\n```\n\n`updateLeaderEpoch()` will read `LeaderIsrAndControllerEpoch` from zookeeper, increment `leaderEpoch` by 1, and write this back to zookeeper. A `LeaderAndIsrRequest` will later be constructed with incremented `leaderEpoch` and sent to brokers in `ControllerBrokerRequestBatch.sendRequestsToBrokers()`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/155496605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/155513254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/485#issuecomment-155513254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/485","id":155513254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTUxMzI1NA==","user":{"login":"fpj","id":572920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/572920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj","html_url":"https://github.com/fpj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-10T17:54:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-10T17:54:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp this doesn't quite work for me, check this out:\n\n```\n./gradlew build\nTo honour the JVM settings for this build a new JVM will be forked.
