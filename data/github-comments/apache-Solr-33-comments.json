In short - Solr already has a v2 API that offers the functionality exposed by this PR in its `ZookeeperReadAPI`.\r\n\r\nSo, bad news, I might've wasted some of your time by missing that class previously - and I'm really sorry about that!  My mistake entirely!  But on the bright side - that also means there's no need to fix any of the remaining comments on this PR.  Which hopefully takes a few things off your plate!\r\n\r\nThe ZookeeperReadAPI code does still need a few improvements I think to fit in with the rest of the v2 endpoints we've been upgrading.

Ideally this would be built out with more test cases, but for now I went light on tests for the proof-of-concept/reference-implementation `ThinCache`, as it was intended at this point mainly to illustrate the value of the \"node-level cache\" approach.\r\n\r\nYou'd configure the node-level backing cache in `solr.xml`:\r\n```xml\r\n<solr>\r\n  <caches>\r\n    <cache name=\"myNodeLevelCache\"\r\n      class=\"solr.ThinCache$NodeLevelCache\"\r\n      maxRamMB=\"1024\"\r\n      />\r\n  </caches>\r\n</solr>\r\n```\r\n... and the missing piece is that you'd configure the `ThinCache` in the same way you would any core-level cache (in `solrconfig.xml`), providing the name of the node-level backing cache as a config attribute:\r\n```xml\r\n        <filterCache class=\"solr.ThinCache\"\r\n            nodeLevelCacheName=\"myNodeLevelCache\"\r\n            autowarmCount=\"10\"\r\n            />\r\n```\r\n`NodeLevelCache` extends `solr.CaffeineCache`, and can take any config param that CaffeineCache takes (wrt eviction policies, etc., though due to having a different lifecycle than a core-based cache, \"autowarm\" is not directly applicable at the node level).\r\n\r\n`ThinCache` has basically two params: `nodeLevelCacheName`, and `autowarmCount`, because autowarm is the one cache attribute that's still evaluated at the per-core level.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1428666164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1428973093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1351#issuecomment-1428973093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1351","id":1428973093,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5VLGYl","user":{"login":"noblepaul","id":54862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul","html_url":"https://github.com/noblepaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noblepaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T01:32:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T01:32:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@magibney \r\n\r\n`nodeLevelCacheName=\"myNodeLevelCache\"`\r\n\r\nIs this support added ?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1428973093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1429018399","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1351#issuecomment-1429018399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1351","id":1429018399,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5VLRcf","user":{"login":"magibney","id":6225104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjUxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6225104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney","html_url":"https://github.com/magibney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magibney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T02:28:39Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T02:28:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Is this support added ?\r\n\r\nYes. `ThinCache` class (which is suppressed as a new file with relatively many lines in the diff in github) should be a complete working implementation of the behavior we're discussing.

We proceed to commit this with the current proof-of-concept `ThinCache` implementation (building out tests and refguide accordingly).\r\n3. We close this PR, and come back to it when it can be introduced alongside a less naive implementation leveraging this functionality.\r\n\r\nMy preferred approach would be the first of these: to revert 916806b39e0f39424fec0a6946e85486a65fc422 (the introduction of the `ThinCache` proof-of-concept) and only commit the minor infrastructural changes that enable configuring node-level caches, and enable searcher-aware core caches (a prerequisite for core/searcher-scoped keys at the node level). The benefit of this approach would be that it would support independent experimentation with pluggable cache impls leveraging a node-level approach, allowing implementations to be more fully developed before if/when being contributed to Solr core.\r\n\r\nThe downside of option 2 would be that if people start using the naive `ThinCache` proof-of-concept, it makes upgrade paths more challenging (and comes with the risk of presenting a relatively new implementation when there's very little downside to providing the opportunity to approach the addition of new cache impls in a more deliberate way). The pluggable nature of the `ThinCache` impl means that anyone who wants to run it could easily compile it themselves (as a plugin).\r\n\r\nOption 3 is totally fine too, and would probably be my second choice (after option 1). The upside of this approach would be that if the interface needs to change (for some reason?) to support a more robust cache implementation, the node-level and searcher-aware changes could arrive more fully-formed (though tbh what's needed here is quite straightforward and I'd be very surprised if it needed to change). The downside of option 3 is that (obviously) folks who wanted to experiment with this approach would have to do so on a custom branch of Solr, making experimentation with a node-level cache approach more difficult for many people (and potentially resulting in divergent approaches to common configuration, which would need to be reconciled).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1434945785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1435108644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1324#issuecomment-1435108644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1324","id":1435108644,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5VigUk","user":{"login":"andywebb1975","id":8749798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NDk3OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8749798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975","html_url":"https://github.com/andywebb1975","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andywebb1975/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T19:03:17Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T19:03:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Oh.. somehow, I stepped in CHANGES.

There's nothing OS-specific (that I'm aware of) in any of the dependency-injection stuff.  And, fwiw, I took another stab at reproducing on MacOS this morning and couldn't see any of the logs either.\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that this is probably related to how Solr uses separate Jersey applications for \"container\" and \"per-core\" APIs.  There are some situations where Solr isn't sure what \"type\" an incoming request is, so it tries sending the request to one Jersey app, and only tries the second if the first errors out.  That'd help explain how we see clear errors in the logs despite the request ultimately succeeding: one Jersey app fails with the observed errors before the second Jersey app succeeds.\r\n\r\nBut I'm stumped why this behavior would be OS dependent, or even why it'd fail with an injection error.  In the scenario above the first Jersey app typically fails with a NotFoundException that is handled specially so that it doesn't pollute the logs.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn terms of moving forward here, if the requests failed on Windows it'd be a very different matter.  But I think the extra noise in the logs is probably tolerable for now given that v2 is an experimental feature.  Absolutely something that needs fixed, but it feels like a framework problem and not something inherent to this PR.\r\n\r\nI'll plan on merging this to 'main' and letting it bake a bit before
