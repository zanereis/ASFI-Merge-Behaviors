I used the patch in this pull request (#268) as the basis, added my changes, and then pulled in the latest upstream Storm changes for 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT via `git merge upstream/master`.\n\nHigh-level changes:\n- The great majority was refactoring the [Client.java](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/messaging/netty/Client.java) in the Netty messaging backend.  For instance, I removed unused imports, obsolete code, clarified variables/methods, consolidated duplicate code, added documentation, improved logging (which also helped me a lot while I was bug-hunting), etc.\n- I also introduced a few functional changes to the code in order to fix the issue at hand.

This change was needed because the original+improved STORM-329 patches modify Storm so that it will ensure the readiness of server and client instances during the initial startup of a topology, but the Netty unit tests are test-driving servers and clients directly, so the tests couldn't rely on Storm's help.\n\nTesting:\n- The improved patch passes the full Storm's test suite.\n- I have successfully tested a patched version of Storm 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT (code as of today) in a Storm cluster via the aforementioned storm-bolt-of-death topology.\n  - With the original patch, restarted bolt instances would not receive new incoming data.  With the improved patch the bolt instances start processing new data immediately (as expected).\n\nNext steps:\n- I would appreciate any feedback of other developers on this improved patch.  I'd particularly appreciate any performance tests in addition to functional tests.  (I do not expect a performance degradation but of course I might be wrong.)\n- The storm-bolt-of-death topology to trigger the cascading failure should be available by tomorrow for your testing convenience.\n\nMany thanks again to @tedxia and @clockfly for the original patch, which already covered a lot (most?) of the work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/73527901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612467155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4171#issuecomment-2612467155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4171","id":2612467155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NjcxNTU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-09T15:31:26Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:54:23Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user miguno commented on the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/268#issuecomment-73527901\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/268#issuecomment-73527901</a></p>\n\n<p>    I have improved the patch in this pull request, which particularly meant modifications to</p>\n\n<p>    The updated patch is availabe at:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/miguno/storm/commits/0.10.0-SNAPSHOT-STORM-392-miguno-merge\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/miguno/storm/commits/0.10.0-SNAPSHOT-STORM-392-miguno-merge</a></li>\n\t<li>The relevant commit is <a href=\"https://github.com/miguno/storm/commit/8ebaaf8dbc63df3c2691e0cc3ac5102af7721ec3\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/miguno/storm/commit/8ebaaf8dbc63df3c2691e0cc3ac5102af7721ec3</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    Code lineage: This improved patch includes the latest Storm 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT code as of today, Feb 09.

problem.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612524598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/73534819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/358#issuecomment-73534819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/358","id":73534819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTM0ODE5","user":{"login":"d2r","id":905298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r","html_url":"https://github.com/d2r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-09T16:06:05Z","updated_at":"2015-02-09T16:06:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/73534819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612516762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4442#issuecomment-2612516762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4442","id":2612516762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MTY3NjI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-09T16:06:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:20:21Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

The first one is Client side, where it keeps messages buffered waiting to send them over the wire.  This is what <tt>messagingClientLoad</tt> tries to measure and may be caused by a slow connection or by a worker exiting and restarting.  The second place it buffers messages is server side. Here a dedicated thread is trying to send the messages to the downstream bolts as quickly as possible.  There are only a few times where this can backup.  The first is if the single thread cannot keep up with all of the messages.

I don't see how we could ever make a custom grouping that is a subclasses of TBase, and even if we could the code in ThriftSerializationDelegateBridge would break, because we would write it out using thrift, but try to read it back in using java serialization.  I am not really sure the best way to handle this though.  The only real thing that comes to mind would be to have different serialization delegates for different places we store data.  One would be for the topology instances, which we could leave using java serialization because it is part of the contract we made in the API for bolts, spouts, and groupings. The other would be for everything else.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/73541891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/383#issuecomment-73541891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/383","id":73541891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTQxODkx","user":{"login":"d2r","id":905298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTI5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r","html_url":"https://github.com/d2r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-09T16:41:59Z","updated_at":"2015-02-09T16:41:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1

The code does not use these objects but uses the fields inside these objects and passes the value of the field around different functions. Each function also makes certain assumptions like a map is always a clojure map and thus its iterable, or some list is always sorted or the first element of some list is a string and the second is integer. You can see these assumptions being fulfilled by the converter right now but in absence of it I had to modify a lot of code all over the code base. So I decided to focus on just making rolling upgrade possible first and nailing down the correct thrift structures which it self seemed like a big enough win.</p>\n\n<p>    Here is the code that attempts to do what you are suggesting, its not complete but kind of gives you an idea why it might not be a good idea to undertake that task as part of this PR <a href=\"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt/incubator-storm/compare/thrift-structures?expand=1\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt/incubator-storm/compare/thrift-structures?expand=1</a></p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4475#issuecomment-2612521178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4475","id":2612521178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MjExNzg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-09T18:30:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:22:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user revans2 commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/414#discussion_r24351697\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/414#discussion_r24351697</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/serialization/ThriftSerializationDelegate.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,52 @@<br/>\n    +/**<br/>\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one<br/>\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.

Note how we are NOT checking for a `WRITABLE` channel while flushing (full) message batches (cf. the `while` loop), but we do check for a `WRITABLE` channel when handling any left-over messages (cf. after the `while` loop).</p>\n\n<p>    ```java<br/>\n/**</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enqueue task messages to be sent to the remote destination (cf. `host` and `port`).<br/>\n */<br/>\n@Override<br/>\npublic synchronized void send(Iterator<TaskMessage> msgs) {</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>    // ...some code removed to shorten this code snippet...</p>\n\n<p>    Channel channel = channelRef.get();<br/>\n    if (!connectionEstablished(channel)) </p>\n{\n// Closing the channel and reconnecting should be done before handling the messages.\ncloseChannelAndReconnect(channel);\nhandleMessagesWhenConnectionIsUnavailable(msgs);\nreturn;\n    }\n\n<p>    // Collect messages into batches (to optimize network throughput), then flush them.<br/>\n    while (msgs.hasNext()) {<br/>\nTaskMessage message = msgs.next();<br/>\nif (messageBatch == null) </p>\n{\n    messageBatch = new MessageBatch(messageBatchSize);\n}\n\n<p>messageBatch.add(message);<br/>\n// TODO: What shall we do if the channel is not writable?<br/>\nif (messageBatch.isFull()) </p>\n{\n    MessageBatch toBeFlushed = messageBatch;\n    flushMessages(channel, toBeFlushed);\n    messageBatch = null;\n}\n<p>    }</p>\n\n<p>    // Handle any remaining messages in case the \"last\" batch was not full.<br/>\n    if (containsMessages(messageBatch)) {<br/>\nif (connectionEstablished(channel) && channel.isWritable()) </p>\n{\n    // We can write to the channel, so we flush the remaining messages immediately to minimize latency.\n    pauseBackgroundFlushing();\n    MessageBatch toBeFlushed = messageBatch;\n    messageBatch = null;\n    flushMessages(channel, toBeFlushed);\n}\n<p>else </p>\n{\n    // We cannot write to the channel, which means Netty's internal write buffer is full.\n    // In this case, we buffer the remaining messages and wait for the next messages to arrive.\n    //\n    // Background:\n    // Netty 3.x maintains an internal write buffer with a high water mark for each channel (default: 64K).\n    // This represents the amount of data waiting to be flushed to operating system buffers.  If the\n    // outstanding data exceeds this value then the channel is set to non-writable.  When this happens, a\n    // INTEREST_CHANGED channel event is triggered.

StormTopology is a thrift structure so I think we can use thriftSerializationDelegate. The Spouts and Bolts have Component structures which are just serialized java bytes. Do you mean every place where we are just calling \"get_serialized_java\" on thrift instances should use java serialization? I think that makes sense and I can make that change.  Let me know if I misunderstood your comment.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612521189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/73822455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/394#issuecomment-73822455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/394","id":73822455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODIyNDU1","user":{"login":"caofangkun","id":1931407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzE0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1931407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun","html_url":"https://github.com/caofangkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-11T01:54:24Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T01:54:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's
