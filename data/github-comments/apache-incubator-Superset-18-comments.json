@mistercrunch we're running into this again.  Does your comment above mean that all your presto timestamp comparisons are being done as lexical string comparisons?   I don't think presto actually auto-casts varchars to timestamps (or at least I couldn't find anything in any of the [release notes](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/release.html) from 0.130 to 0.147)), so this means that if we do have timestamp columns, we would need to cast them to strings.\n\nI appreciate the bind you're in due to storing ISO 8601 strings as dates, but shouldn't we use db-native timestamp comparisons, as in the [oracle conversion](https://github.com/tarekrached/caravel/blob/7284e1fd585aa557d9eefdee182f6ae52631b86e/caravel/models.py#L438-L440) directly before this change.

the record, we want the casting or transformation to be applied to the constant and not the column. It's possible today to create whatever column expression and have Caravel do the time filtering against that expression. This isn't ideal because the database optimizer gets thrown off and can't do partition pruning or use indexes on the column. \n\nThe ideal scenario is where the user can tell Caravel knows how to prepare the right side of the equation to use against that time-like column.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/226529043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/226535815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/506#issuecomment-226535815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/506","id":226535815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjUzNTgxNQ==","user":{"login":"tarekrached","id":167218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached","html_url":"https://github.com/tarekrached","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarekrached/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T16:16:25Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T16:16:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@mistercrunch, that sounds solid.

about two fields instead of one in Column model:\n- `python_date_format` : if the date is stored as a string in the database, this field stores a python date format expression as defined by `strftime` (link to it!) to be able to interact with it\n- `database_expression`: if the Caravel datetime constants need to be altered or casted on the database server side, this field should contain the casting expression as in `TO_DATE('{dttm}', 'YYYYMMDD')`, where `{dttm}` will contain the datetime string, formatted based on the `python_date_format` specified above\n\nDoes that cover all scenarios?\n\nNote that we'll need to maintain the current behavior as much as possible, either by pre-populating these fields based on current database defaults in the db migration script, or by leaving the field empty

empty.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/226548782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/226550728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/632#issuecomment-226550728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/632","id":226550728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjU1MDcyOA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T17:11:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T17:11:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage
