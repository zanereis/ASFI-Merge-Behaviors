To double check:\r\n  - Does HDFS permit to rename to an already existing file name (replacing that existing file)?\r\n  - If yes, this sounds reasonable. If not, this could be an issue (need to delete the original file before rename, failure in that case means file does not exist on recovery).\r\n\r\nThere is another option to approach this:\r\n  - The recoverable writer has the option to say if it can also \"recover for resume\" or only \"recover for commit\". \"Recover for resume\" leads to appending to the started file, while only supporting \"recover for commit\" means that a new part file would be started after recovery.\r\n  - This version could declare itself to only \"recover for commit\", in which case we would never have to go back to the original file name, but only copy from the \"part in progress\"-file to the published file name, avoiding the above problem.\r\n  - That would mean we need to have the \"truncater\" handle the \"truncate existing file back\" logic and \"truncating rename\". The legacy hadoop handler would only implement the second - truncating rename.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/420199851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/420210267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6483#issuecomment-420210267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6483","id":420210267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDIxMDI2Nw==","user":{"login":"lvhuyen","id":31494068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDk0MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31494068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen","html_url":"https://github.com/lvhuyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvhuyen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-11T09:32:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T09:32:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you @HuangZhenQiu.\r\n\r\nI created a [(quick patch),](https://github.com/lvhuyen/flink/tree/parquet_input_format(7243)) for that Timestamp conversion and my Flink job has been running well with ParquetPojoInputFormat.\r\n\r\nOne more issue I found in the current build is with the parquet file having a column of type Array of primitive.

@TisonKun, if there is no conflict, I usually merge a PR with the following steps.\r\n\r\n- fetch commits of a PR to a local branch\r\n- review and do some minor refactorings \r\n- squash the commits into a single one and clean up the commit message (JIRA, tags, message, adding \"This closes #XXXX\")\r\n- pull the latest master\r\n- rebase to master\r\n- merge to local master\r\n- push master to my GitHub repository to trigger a Travis run\r\n- if tests pass, push master to apache master\r\n- delete the local PR
