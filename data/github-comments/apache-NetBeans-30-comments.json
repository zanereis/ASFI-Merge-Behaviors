Matthias is putting the user first, and that's my motto as well, so I have to agree with his veto.\r\n\r\nTrying to be positive, I'd rather see a \"Java\" main section with the following options:\r\n\r\n- Ant based project.\r\n- Maven based project.\r\n\r\nAlso let's try to be positive about ant. Apache Ant is a companion project in the ASF and deserves our consideration. The fact that it's an \"old technology\" deserves a respect as well. Ant has served NetBeans well during many years, and we still depend on it to build our own food.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/443528012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/443533081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1038#issuecomment-443533081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1038","id":443533081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzUzMzA4MQ==","user":{"login":"eppleton","id":2115639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTU2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2115639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton","html_url":"https://github.com/eppleton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eppleton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-02T19:03:13Z","updated_at":"2018-12-02T19:03:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@viero I think everyone here tries to put the user first. In my personal opinion, the PR does that, and the other solution would be confusing and bad for the user. You have a different opinion. That's OK and I respect that. But please don't assume that I don't care about usability. If you read my replies you should be able to see that my whole argument is about usability, and I'd be glad if you could respect that too, even if you don't agree.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing There was a \"Java\" category before, which defaulted to ANT, now it defaults to Maven. How is this a step back? It is a change of the default for Java, no more no less. And regarding the \"Choices\" blog, that Tim Boudreau mentioned on the mailing list: For a Java newbie it's exactly the same as the \"optimize database\" example in the blog: We ask the user for a decision he very likely doesn't care about and doesn't have enough information to make (What is ANT or Maven?). And for a more experienced user it's not hard to find the information, as it is in the description of the wizard.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/443533081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
