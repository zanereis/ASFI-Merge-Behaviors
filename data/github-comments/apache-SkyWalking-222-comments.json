The frequency of slow SQL call can be reflected by the frequency of slow SQL in sampling data, which is also of great reference value\r\n\r\n2. After being associated with specific services, it is convenient to quickly locate problems. Do we have to recall in our brain or look up the code to find out which service is related to? There are also multiple tables in a database. Different tables correspond to different services in use, or in different databases of the same instance. It is impossible to completely realize that one service corresponds to one database instance.
