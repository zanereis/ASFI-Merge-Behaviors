I can agree what @harissecic says.

It does not concatenate the two inputs. You can read that up in the java documentation. It strips everything from the issuerURL after the `www.xyz.com` and adds the `\"/.well-known/openid-configuration\"`.\r\n\r\nSo no matter what you pass in as issuerURL` www.xyz.com` or` www.xyz.com/auth/realms/myrealm/` (which we want to pass in, or rather what you need to pass in if you use keycloak) it always ends up as `www.xyz.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.\r\n\r\nThats why i just changed it the line to `return new URL(issuerUrl.toString() + \"/.well-known/openid-configuration\");` so it actually gets appended.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/686508429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/686526204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7682#issuecomment-686526204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7682","id":686526204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjUyNjIwNA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-03T14:21:52Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T14:21:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fracasula interesting... did you specify the offloader such as `managedLedgerOffloadDriver` in the broker.conf?

It looks like the fix would silently by-pass any operations when dispatcher is null. Wouldn't skipping the operations cause issues in consistency? Is it ok to skip the operations? I guess it is, but I'm just trying to understand Pulsar coding style by following how it's developed. Therefore I'm asking these questions. Perhaps some day I'd be able to contribute too. :)\r\nJust thinking out loud here. I don't mean to be rude.\r\n\r\nThere are 16 times that `dispatcher != null` is in the code of PersistentSubscription. Why is dispatcher null in the first place? Would there be a need to improve the design, for example have some kind of state machine / model that would help organize the code in a better way? It seems that the design isn't optimal if each time you call a method on dispatcher, you would have to do a null check. I'd assume that some kind of proxy pattern would encapsulate things in a better way.\r\n(Another unrelated observation is that there are a lot of synchronized methods in the PersistentSubscription class, however I guess there isn't a lockfree design in Pulsar in

Even with `authenticationRefreshCheckSeconds` set, the client just keeps on producing even though the token already expired. I think this problem only occurs when using a proxy, because in your test above @zymap i think you are using a direct connection between the client and broker. In my tests i was using the python client and not the go client though.\r\n\r\nThe proxy even notices that the token is invalid (atleats it says that in the logs) but it just keeps on producing. And all the message that are produced can be consumed as well, so its not just a visual bug of some sort.\r\n\r\nI am happy to provide more info if you need it.\r\nHope this helps!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/687112995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/687115814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7974#issuecomment-687115814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7974","id":687115814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzExNTgxNA==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-04T12:35:36Z","updated_at":"2020-09-04T12:35:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot
