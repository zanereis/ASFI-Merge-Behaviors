Since we have to control the transaction by ourself according to the different transactionType setting in the configuration, is it right ?\r\n\r\nYep, we need to control trx flow. Plus, I presume at this moment, we need to consider how to gracefully support XA transaction. I see @roodkcab did a lot of work on parsing and implementing XA SQL. Why isn't XA SQL supported so far? Actually, ShardingSpehre planned to hide the distributed transaction from users. Users do not need to be aware of the distributed transactions as if they are using one DBMS (Local trx). Imaging users take Proxy as a standalone DB, it's supposed that no distributed trx comes to their mind. That's why we haven't supported XA trx so far. We hope to hide and simplify the distributed transaction implementance from users. Only by calling non-distributed transactions simple API, users can achieve distributed trx. The key role during this process is ShardingSphere.\r\n\r\nHowever, from distributed trx angle, It's fine to make ShardingSphere support XA API. But we need to consider how to make ShardingSphere responds to XA user API reasonably.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/950255541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/950257412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13187#issuecomment-950257412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13187","id":950257412,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M44o8cE","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T04:17:04Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T04:17:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Then I propose the following changes with TransactionBackendHandlerFactory\r\n\r\nHonestly speaking, I am a little blurred of \r\n```java\r\nNo.61      return new TransactionBackendHandler(tclStatement, TransactionOperationType.BEGIN, backendConnection); \r\n```\r\nI suppose this statement is to make ShardingSphere prepared for the next coming trx.

I checked the `org.apache.shardingsphere.mode.repository.cluster.zookeeper.CuratorZookeeperRepository` of the ShardSphere-Proxy 5.0.0-RC1 source code and found that its correct configuration should be Only the id part of the ACL should be configured.

Plus, I presume at this moment, we need to consider how to gracefully support XA transaction. I see @roodkcab did a lot of work on parsing and implementing XA SQL. Why isn't XA SQL supported so far? Actually, ShardingSpehre planned to hide the distributed transaction from users. Users do not need to be aware of the distributed transactions as if they are using one DBMS (Local trx). Imaging users take Proxy as a standalone DB, it's supposed that no distributed trx comes to their mind. That's why we haven't supported XA trx so far. We hope to hide and simplify the distributed transaction implementance from users. Only by calling non-distributed transactions simple API, users can achieve distributed trx. The key role during this process is ShardingSphere.\r\n\r\nI see, it's really nice to support XA trx transparently. I don't think there's any easy way to support such feature, considering we have no context to know users' SQLs to be executed without calling ```XA``` statements explicitly.\r\n \r\n> However, from distributed trx angle, It's fine to make ShardingSphere support XA API. But we need to consider how to make ShardingSphere responds to XA user API reasonably.\r\n\r\nany suggestion is wellcome.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/950449532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/950460294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13187#issuecomment-950460294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13187","id":950460294,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M44pt-G","user":{"login":"zhfeng","id":1246139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDYxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1246139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T02:00:05Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T02:00:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tristaZero I think the idea of hiding distributed transaction from users means that in sharding database cases, for example a INSERT SQL could be rewritten to more acutal SQLs to exeucte on the different backend databases, and Shardingsphere will handle the different type of transaction (LOCAL, XA or BASE) to make sure the consistent of data which means INSERT THEM ALL OR NOTHING. Correct me if I misundertand the transaction model of shardingsphere. @terrymanu \r\n\r\nAnd in term of XA support, I think the user would like to coordinate the database operation and others by the external Transaction Manager. For example, insert into db and send a message to MQ\r\n\r\n```\r\ntx.begin();\r\n// the shardingsphere will insert into two backend databse accroding to the user_id sharding rule\r\nds.executeSQL(\"INSERT INTO t_user VALUES ('1', 'user1'), ('2', 'user2')\");\r\njms.send(\"insert users\");\r\n\r\ntx.commit(); // tx.rollback();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the Shardingsphere does not support XA, when user decide to rollback the transaction, the message will not be sent to MQ but the data have been inserted into database that could break the bussiness

@roodkcab \r\n\r\n> I see, it's really nice to support XA trx transparently. I don't think there's any easy way to support such feature, considering we have no context to know users' SQLs to be executed without calling XA statements explicitly.\r\n\r\nIt's possible for ShardingSphere to know, as it needs to deal with users' SQL (parsing, routing and rewriting) and send them to DB. Therefore, if we find this logic SQL in one transaction will be executed in different DBs, then XA (or B.A.S.E) begins to work. Otherwise, this trx will become a local trx.

Do you think the current transaction function of ShardingSphere can meet your needs? \r\n\r\nHi @zhfeng \r\nI'd like to expand the distributed SQLs ShardingSphere faces,\r\nFirst, the case you mentioned (One logic SQL has multiple actual SQLs) is certainly a kind of distributed transaction. Moreover, the following one is another case.\r\n```sql\r\nbegin;\r\n// This SQL is going to be executed on db0, db1\r\nupdate t_order\r\n// This SQL will be executed on db2, db3\r\nupdate t_item\r\ncommit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n> And in term of XA support, I think the user would like to coordinate the database operation and others by the external Transaction Manager. For example, insert into db and send a message to MQ\r\n\r\nI am interested in this case. Could you explain more? I mean, like a Java program, a XA can deal with different types of databases in the same trx? Does that mean redis also implement the XA API?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/951648731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/951657904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13187#issuecomment-951657904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13187","id":951657904,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M44uSWw","user":{"login":"roodkcab","id":1700820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDA4MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1700820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab","html_url":"https://github.com/roodkcab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roodkcab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T07:55:36Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T07:55:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Hi @roodkcab\r\n> \r\n> > I see, it's really nice to support XA trx transparently.

The current structure is only to indirectly introduce distsql dependency for shardingsphere-proxy-backend module.\r\n\r\nIt is same with the 1st question, if DistSQL is necessary for all adaptors, we need to move it from shardingsphere-proxy-backend module to more kernel module.\r\n\r\n> 3. Feature-distsql may need to use the objects in feature-core, but because of the dependency order, it cannot be imported conveniently.\r\n\r\nMaybe we need to keep it with same reason to previous questions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/952121131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/952189563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/13295#issuecomment-952189563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13295","id":952189563,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M44wUJ7","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T18:13:31Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T18:13:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

@terrymanu ,\r\nthank you for your reply.\r\nI agree with your idea, and now I want to discuss the third question first:\r\n\r\n> `feature-distsql` may need to use the objects in `feature-core`, but because of the dependency order, it cannot be imported conveniently.\r\n\r\nSince DistSQL needs to depend on the code of the `feature-core` module, can we adjust the dependency order first so that the development plan can proceed?\r\nWhen ShardingSphere-JDBC needs to support DistSQL, it is a relatively long-term plan to redesign the module structure and make relevant adjustments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/952490211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/952496720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13233#issuecomment-952496720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13233","id":952496720,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M44xfJQ","user":{"login":"tuyingDavid","id":88995105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4OTk1MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88995105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid","html_url":"https://github.com/tuyingDavid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuyingDavid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-27T03:06:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T03:06:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We
