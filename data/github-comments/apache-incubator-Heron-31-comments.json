too can free up some cycles for this improvement. May be this can be done incrementally, one interface at a time.\n\nBTW, I spoke to a couple of folks here about Guice. [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) and [Tang](https://reef.apache.org/tang.html) seem to have evolved from Guice. Both systems provide static compile time checks which seem to be a major limitation of Guice. So I think we could use the newer solutions. I used tang in the YARN scheduler. Most of the configuration errors will be flagged by the IDE itself. It reduced number of required iterations. If you think it helps, I can create a small patch as an example. Although the Tang community is very active, there is limited support available outside.\n\nMisc references on Dagger\n1. https://dig.floatingsun.net/dagger-vs-guice-8c9fbae4712e#.e1223p2x7\n1.
