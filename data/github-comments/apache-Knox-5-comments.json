If none is selected -> no discovery will be performed. Discovery type is still optional (that is, the end-user does not need to select one) and makes the code easier to read and understand:\r\n> \r\nMy only concern is that existing descriptors that depend on the default type determination may be broken. Perhaps, that is not a significant concern though.\r\n\r\n> * `performDiscovery` should only be invoked if discovery type is not `null` [here](https://github.com/apache/knox/blob/v1.4.0/gateway-topology-simple/src/main/java/org/apache/knox/gateway/topology/simple/SimpleDescriptorHandler.java#L109)\r\n> * the [default discovery type](https://github.com/apache/knox/blob/v1.4.0/gateway-topology-simple/src/main/java/org/apache/knox/gateway/topology/simple/SimpleDescriptorHandler.java#L71) should be removed\r\n> * we may want to add some `WARN` level messages in the log in case discovery type is not selected but any of the other discovery related configuration is present. This check should be implemented in `SimpleDescriptorImpl` instead of in `SimpleDescriptorHandler` where only the log should be placed.\r\n> \r\nI may be misunderstanding, but I think I disagree about the placement of this logic. The handler is interpreting the descriptor state to make the decision to perform discovery or not; I don't think that is an implementation-specific decision, and I don't think the descriptor should be responsible for discovery logic since it's really just a representation of a config file.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/620003022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/620135278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/326#issuecomment-620135278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/326","id":620135278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDEzNTI3OA==","user":{"login":"pzampino","id":13018719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE4NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13018719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino","html_url":"https://github.com/pzampino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-27T17:48:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T17:48:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've

In addition to my previous comments I'd also suggest another change:\r\n> in `org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.AliasBasedTokenStateService.stop()` you may persist all entries in `unpersistedState` after shutting down the scheduler to provide one more final round of token persistence.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a good suggestion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/644128164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/645158025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/347#issuecomment-645158025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/347","id":645158025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTE1ODAyNQ==","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-17T05:22:35Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T05:22:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So,
