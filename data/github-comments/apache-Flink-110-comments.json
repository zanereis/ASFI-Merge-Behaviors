I haven't looked very deeply at the actual code but let me share some thoughts:\n\nI was under the impression that the core of this issue was to implement at least 1 Histogram that does not rely on another library. It _should_ contain at least one to guarantee that the compatibility layer works properly.\n\nThe original PR for the metric system already contained wrapped DropWIzard Histograms, which were specifically taken out as they did not meet our performance needs. Why we now essentially revert this decision now 2 weeks later is beyond me. I also hope you did not spend too much time writing this as a lot of similar code already existed.\n\nAs such I really don't see the point of the DropWizardWrapper. IMO the only thing we need is the HistogramWrapper class, which may require a more distinctive name btw. . We should not expose a DW -> Flink compatibility layer, next up people want to use DW Timers, Gauges etc. as well. This will simply create more work for us.\n\nThe original PR also contained the flink-metric-reporters module as flink-metrics. Now we revert this again as well.

The important thing is that the histograms are not used by the runtime per default, because they indeed don't come for free. But if the user decides to use such a metric, then he should be able to explicitly register a histogram.\n\nAdditionally, we don't want to add a strict dependency on dropwizard from flink-core. Therefore, I introduced the `Histogram` interface which effectively hides the concrete implementation. So later we can easily swap the implementation out.\n\nOne of these implementations is the `DropwizardHistogramWrapper` which allows you to use Dropwizard histograms in Flink. The reason for this is that Dropwizard's `Histogram` has already a lot of functionality (different reservoirs for sampling streams, for example) and it would be a lot of duplicate work to reimplement it.\n\nSince the assumption is that `Histograms` are a user metric, it seems to be ok for me to not ship an implementation of the interface with flink-core but to require the user to include an additional module such as flink-metrics-dropwizard. This module would add the dropwizard dependency anyway. If necessary, then we can also add our own histogram implementation later.\n\nThe PR does not introduce a Dropwizard compatibility layer. Dropwizard is only one of many possible implementation for our metrics (counter, gauge and histogram so far). It is up to the community to decide which other metrics to add.\n\nI agree that the naming of `HistogramWrapper` is not so distinctive. I actually sticked to the naming scheme for `Counter` and `Gauge` which are called `CounterWrapper` and `GaugeWrapper`. This can be  easily changed. Do you have a proposal?\n\nI'm sorry if you feel angry because you already did some of this work which was later removed. But please keep in mind that not everyone was involved in the metrics PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/226473776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/226482719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2093#issuecomment-226482719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2093","id":226482719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjQ4MjcxOQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-16T13:20:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T13:20:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you please update the tests to add elements to `expectedOutput` in line with the `processElement` and `processWatermark` calls on the test harness.

Because calcite have no plus(String, String) method. \n   \n   ```\n   java.lang.RuntimeException: while resolving method 'plus[class java.lang.String, class java.lang.String]' in class class org.apache.calcite.runtime.SqlFunctions\n   \n   at org.apache.calcite.linq4j.tree.Types.lookupMethod(Types.java:345)\n   at org.apache.calcite.linq4j.tree.Expressions.call(Expressions.java:442)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexImpTable$BinaryImplementor.implement(RexImpTable.java:1640)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexImpTable.implementCall(RexImpTable.java:854)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexImpTable.implementNullSemantics(RexImpTable.java:843)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexImpTable.implementNullSemantics0(RexImpTable.java:756)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexImpTable.access$900(RexImpTable.java:181)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexImpTable$3.implement(RexImpTable.java:411)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translateCall(RexToLixTranslator.java:535)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translate0(RexToLixTranslator.java:507)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translate(RexToLixTranslator.java:222)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translate0(RexToLixTranslator.java:472)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translate(RexToLixTranslator.java:222)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translate(RexToLixTranslator.java:217)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translateList(RexToLixTranslator.java:700)\n   at org.apache.calcite.adapter.enumerable.RexToLixTranslator.translateProjects(RexToLixTranslator.java:192)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rex.RexExecutorImpl.compile(RexExecutorImpl.java:80)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rex.RexExecutorImpl.compile(RexExecutorImpl.java:59)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rex.RexExecutorImpl.reduce(RexExecutorImpl.java:118)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rel.rules.ReduceExpressionsRule.reduceExpressionsInternal(ReduceExpressionsRule.java:544)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rel.rules.ReduceExpressionsRule.reduceExpressions(ReduceExpressionsRule.java:455)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rel.rules.ReduceExpressionsRule.reduceExpressions(ReduceExpressionsRule.java:438)\n   at org.apache.calcite.rel.rules.ReduceExpressionsRule$CalcReduceExpressionsRule.onMatch(ReduceExpressionsRule.java:350)\n   at org.apache.calcite.plan.volcano.VolcanoRuleCall.onMatch(VolcanoRuleCall.java:213)\n   at org.apache.calcite.plan.volcano.VolcanoPlanner.findBestExp(VolcanoPlanner.java:838)\n   at org.apache.calcite.tools.Programs$RuleSetProgram.run(Programs.java:334)\n   at org.apache.flink.api.table.BatchTableEnvironment.translate(BatchTableEnvironment.scala:250)\n   at org.apache.flink.api.java.table.BatchTableEnvironment.toDataSet(BatchTableEnvironment.scala:146)\n   at org.apache.flink.api.java.batch.table.ExpressionsITCase.testCom\n   ```\n3.

The config.md file specifies configuration parameters for Flink as a system. These parameters are set in the flink-conf.yaml, and are not passed to the InputFormats configure() method. I believe the keys belong into the DataSource section of the Batch Guide, as users have to set the keys using the DataSource#withParameters() method.\n\nWhich brings me to the second issue: The configure() method is a somewhat antiquated way for users to configure IO-Formats. We now usually use additional arguments in the readTextFile() methods, or additional configuration methods like in readCsvFile(). That said, we can't modify the methods as the ExEnv is @Public, and we can't add another 3-4 variants of readTextFile. We also can't change the return type of readTextFile from DataSource to a more useful TextReader, again because it's @Public.\n\nI'm myself not sure whether it really is an issue, and if so how to resolve it Thus I would like others to weigh in on this one before proceeding further.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/226932708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/226940863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1517#issuecomment-226940863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1517","id":226940863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjk0MDg2Mw==","user":{"login":"ggevay","id":11377925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzc3OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11377925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay","html_url":"https://github.com/ggevay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggevay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-18T12:50:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T12:50:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

a lot for opening a pull request for this.\nI like having virtual machines and deployment available for new projects, so in general I like the idea a lot.\n\nHowever, I wonder if the Flink repository is the right place for such deployment scripts. The `flink-docker` module in the same directory is also something I would like to relocate in the long term.\nThere are some problems with having these in the Flink repository:\n- They tend to outdate over time, because most of the committers don't maintain these scripts.\n- They are not really part of the release cycle. We don't update the versions on releases, they are somehow part of the source release, but not really documented or tested.\n- As you've seen yourself, it can take some time until a pull requests is reviewed and merged.

Have you tried it out with any big inputs? We will definitely have to get rid of the calls to 'collect()' and try to re-think whether we can do without so much state in the auxiliary vertices.\n\nEven though I am quite familiar with the original AP algorithm, I'm not sure I understand all the details of the binary AP. Could you maybe create and explain a small example, for a small input graph and say 2-3 iterations, and show the messages and computations that are required. You can add this to the design document.

I just have a few minor comments:\n- It's very good that you fixed typos and added comments/Javadoc to previously undocumented code. I would like to see them as a separate PR, though, and keep this PR only to the feature mentioned in the Jiras. \n- You added `TestTimeServiceProvider` in two tests. I think it makes sense to move this to the same package as `DefaultTimerService` and clearly mark it as being for testing only. On a related note, it might make sense to normalize the names, right now there is `*TimeServiceProvider` and `*TimerService`.\n- You added the additional method `registerTimer(final long timestamp, final Runnable target)`. I imagine it is because the sources register their watermark timers as a `Runnable`. I think it would be better to keep having only `Triggerable` here. The watermark emitters should also work as a `Triggerable`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/227489088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/227507726","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2069#issuecomment-227507726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2069","id":227507726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzUwNzcyNg==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T17:13:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T17:13:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the suggestion Fabian.
