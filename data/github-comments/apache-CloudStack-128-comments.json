Agree, we should make our Marvin code truly PEP8 compliant as you suggested, and update our Marvin code accordingly.\n\nI ran all our Marvin tests (32 testcases in 6 testscripts) with this PR as it involves Nuage VSP support for underlay networking besides our default overlay networking. Moreover, we perform quite a few VM deployments (reboots, migrations, expunges, etc.) and traffic tests (e.g. SSH into VM and then wget from the Internet) in these tests. Finally, the CentOS guest VM template that we use for our internal regressions takes a bit longer to start/stop guest VMs (rich feature set and programmes).\n\nHere are some metrics:\n1) VM deployements: 63\n2) Isolated network creations: 57\n3) VPC creations: 26\n4) SSH into VMs (reconnects) and traffic tests = 82\n5) Nuage VSP verifications (verifying CloudStack object creation and state in Nuage VSP)  ~ 450\n6) Avg. time for (non-persistent) isolated network creation (VM + VR) ~ 5 minutes \n7) Avg. time for (non-persistent) isolated network cleanup (VM + VR) ~ 2 minutes \n\nNote: Unless required, we don't always run all of our Marvin tests in a single Marvin run.\n\nAnyhow, we actively use nosetests features such as tags/attributes to run subset of these tests in the following scenarios:\n1) simulator (required hardware=false) tests \n2) feature specific tests\n3) basic (smoke) tests\n4) E2E (traffic) tests\n5) underlay/overlay networking tests\n\nNote: Once we have considerable amount of tests in our test/integration/plugins/nuagevsp directory, we are also thinking about splitting them into sub-directories as well (e.g. component, smoke, etc.).\n\nLet me know, your thoughts on this, and if you have any other questions for me.\n\nThank you for your valuable review and suggestions !!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/230000790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/230073764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1600#issuecomment-230073764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1600","id":230073764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDA3Mzc2NA==","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-02T00:39:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-02T00:39:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In manual testing, I've noticed that the SR that contains the VDI that we copy from primary to secondary storage is not removed from XenServer.\n\nI see that the SolidFire volume that contains the SR is no longer in a volume access group (good) and it is deleted (good), but the SR is still attached to by XenServer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/230073764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/230130676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1600#issuecomment-230130676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1600","id":230130676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDEzMDY3Ng==","user":{"login":"syed","id":55854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed","html_url":"https://github.com/syed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-03T01:48:19Z","updated_at":"2016-07-03T01:48:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good catch @mike-tutkowski.

there could be a possibility of having an ipv6 gateway\n\nRight, but IPv6 does not use ARP but [NDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol) ([RFC 4861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861)).\n\nIt seems that a `ping6 -c1 ff02::1%eth0` (interface name is required) would have the same effect (to refresh the cache); so we could do it when no IPv4 GW is found (self reminder: ARP is L2, IP is L3).\n\n> do we know why the arping is failing?\n\nApparently because the file \"/etc/cloudstack/ips.json\" is generated with a gateway at \"None\" even when the gateway is present in the input \"cmd_line.json\" (but my memory could fail me at this time of the day).\n\nOne month ago we found the \"problem\" and wanted a fix; trying to understand _why_ it did happen made me start #1575 (now #1603).\n\nI though it would be good (at least for me) to get a better understanding of the code; doing hundreds of arping everytime is probably inefficient as each of them is supposed to refresh the ARP table of all equipment on the way...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/230596208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/230673384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1605#issuecomment-230673384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1605","id":230673384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDY3MzM4NA==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T05:19:05Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T05:19:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In
