Tests: We can follow the way storm.rb is handled in the repository (3 copies of the same file) and translate the ruby unit tests into nodejs. I can see why you don't want a third window being broken. But I request to take the multilang cleanup into another JIRA, which leads me to ...\n\nPackaging: Deploying and upgrading ruby/python/nodejs code is really different than Java code. Java code in storm is JARed-with-dependencies. Packing nodejs code with its entire npm dependency tree and automating it with maven is possible, but you loose the no-need-to-do-the-compile-thingy nature of the language. So even if we do call gem/pip/npm install from within the maven build process, pack everything in a JAR and ship it with storm, I am not sure I would use it that way. Instead the JAR would just be pure java code pointing to the folder where the ruby/python/nodejs code is. And that is also the folder where storm.rb/py/js would be copied to. So there is no reusable component you can ship with storm, other than the official storm.js file that was tested to work with this version of Storm.\n\nMaintenance: The amount of maintenance of the multilang project is approx numberOfFeatures times the numberOfLanguages times the numberOfSerialization protocols. \nIMO the numberOfLanguages is a strong selling point for Storm (choose the best language that fits your business). Both ruby/python/node have a big crowd of open-source developers this project can rally.\nIMO numberOfFeautres that are not data related is not a strong selling point. For example I would not use the storm logging or monitoring through the multilang protocol. If there is a problem with the multilang/storm/whatever I would like a nodejs library to log it to a file, or contact directly the monitoring server, especially as Storm does the fail-fast-the-worker-with-all-child-processes each time a bolt/spout has an uncaught exception. I doubt the multilang logging could deliver some unexpected error in time before the stdout pipe is closed.\nAs for serialization protocols.... it was abstracted on the Java side recently which allows third party plugins to squeeze more CPU cycles with custom serialization protocols. That's nice, but as JSON is the only supported protocol by the ruby/python/nodejs implementations adding another serialization protocol requires a feature matrix. The proper thing to focus on Storm's core competency and that is Data. JSON would eventually become the bottle neck on the Worker juggling multiple subprocess via serialization and de-serialization of multilang messages. It takes approx 1% CPU core and 1ms latency per multilang process assuming 1 message per second (hardware dependent ofcourse). Instead of JSON I would pick one serialization protocol that has a heavily optimized Java implementation and also widely used python/node/ruby/etc implementations that hopefully do not require native code to install and stick to it. Use serialization/deserialization optimization on the java side (caching) for better performance of the nextTuple and sync messages.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/50210273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/50211743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/203#issuecomment-50211743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/203","id":50211743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjExNzQz","user":{"login":"kishorvpatil","id":6090397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTAzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6090397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil","html_url":"https://github.com/kishorvpatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishorvpatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T22:27:52Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T22:27:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It
