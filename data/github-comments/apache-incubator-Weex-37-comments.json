But it may take a really long time to fix as many UI behaviour relies on the layout code. I am glad if you can give us a PR.\r\n\r\nI will briefly explain the layout algorithm and the reason of the bug below. There are two computing phase during Weex Layout.\r\n* Phase 1: Calculate `hypotheticalWidth` and `hypotheticalHeight` based on`width`, `height`, border-width`, `padding`, `margin`\r\n* Phase 2: Calculate real `width` and `height` based on `hypotheticalWidth`, `hypotheticalHeight``flex-direcon`, `align-items`, `flex` and any other flexbox related styles.\r\n\r\nDuring phase 1, the width of the text or its parent is unknown, the layout algorithm has no way but assumes it is unlimited, e.g. a single line text.\r\n\r\nDuring phase 2, the width and height of the text is correct, but the height of text's parent is still wrong.\r\n\r\n**You got what you see.**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/506227678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/506232946","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2620#issuecomment-506232946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2620","id":506232946,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjIzMjk0Ng==","user":{"login":"YorkShen","id":4162544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjI1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4162544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen","html_url":"https://github.com/YorkShen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-27T07:44:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T07:44:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Duplicated #2599 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/506232946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/comments/506233871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2599#issuecomment-506233871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-weex/issues/2599","id":506233871,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNjIzMzg3MQ==","user":{"login":"YorkShen","id":4162544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjI1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4162544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen","html_url":"https://github.com/YorkShen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YorkShen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-27T07:47:33Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T07:47:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did a little [change](http://dotwe.org/vue/fa924a532690e11a0b0157de05cb0d85) to your demo.
