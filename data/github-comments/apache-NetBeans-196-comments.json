minutes apart, if these two threads stay in the trace.

Looking at the tables (https://www.java.com/releases/matrix/) that is more that two years old.

We are not talking about just rendering plain old stuff, but everytime I'm using stuff to render HTML it looks odd and not full featured.\r\n\r\nI dunno whether the JDK renderer is up to date with all current features of HTML, JS, CSS, etc. We then also have devtools intergration and probably has new features to work with IDE + the devtools. Debugging, etc.\r\n\r\nYes it is a huge stuff but step by step. We can have previews for almost everything what requires HTML. I also wanted to make a preview for SVG, I guess using HTML and a browser is better then smth else. Couldn't find it within batik. So as a frontend dev who wants to integrate more and more features for those techstack I definitely for this big feature.\r\n\r\nI also kow tauri and the technic that neil mentioned and sure, when there is a possibility to use the underlying WebView from the operating system, that would be also fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1906400833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1906626244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6892#issuecomment-1906626244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6892","id":1906626244,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5xpM7E","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-23T18:03:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T18:03:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> text, I was looking at [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) recently, which is using [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry). Tauri is a lightweight Rust Electron alternative that embeds native webview components from the OS. I'm not sure if there's a Java library that can do similar, or how easy to replicate with JNA it might be???\r\n\r\nThe hard part is most probably not binding to the target engine and getting something on screen, but binding to the target engine and getting something into a swing component. If I remember correctly a long time ago someone complained, that JNA can't access the windows handle on mac OS, but nobody bother to implement it. \r\n\r\n> I also wanted to make a preview for SVG, I guess using HTML and a browser is better then smth else.\r\n\r\nAre you looking for https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/javadoc/org/apache/batik/swing/JSVGCanvas.html ?\r\n\r\nhttps://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/javadoc/org/apache/batik/swing/JSVGCanvas.html\r\n\r\n>We are not talking about just rendering plain old stuff, but everytime I'm using stuff to render HTML it looks odd and not full featured.\r\n\r\nI think there was a discussion about providing a base CSS to get better looking markdown rendering, but no one bothered to actually do the work.\r\n\r\nThe question that needs to be answered: Who does the heavy lifting when platforms should be added (Windows arm64, Linux riscv, Other OSes)? Swing is currently a pretty save bet, but Chromium porting? For Linux we will see a time where multiple windowing environments will coexist (X11 and Wayland), what will be the consequence for JCEF?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1906626244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1906650945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6892#issuecomment-1906650945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6892","id":1906650945,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5xpS9B","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-23T18:18:39Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T18:18:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I looked for JSVGCanvas, this is what I found, but NetBeans said that this is not available.

I think what @neilcsmith-net meant was that if someone cared about the **old** release of CND, it would be possible to repack it **without** pack200 and upload it somewhere - without having to rebuild anything.\r\n\r\nA module compressed with pack200 **is a strong indication of it being an unmaintained plugin** which hasn't been rebuild for over a decade. Installation itself will not remain the only problem - having decade old hibernate or struts 1 support (which had the last release 14 years ago) is questionable in itself (#6969, #6987, #6810).\r\n\r\nhere the plugin list of the pre-apache NetBeans 8.2 plugin portal:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/assets/114367/5bc95515-7b6e-41ce-b6ce-b7a5f75d35e4)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I tried to install `C/C++` from plugin portal 8.2 on NB 20 running on JDK 17 (using pack200 from JDK 11) and got many exceptions like:\r\n```\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: 780: Unpacking org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr.nbm\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: File installed /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/config/Modules/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr.xml@0\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: Copied file /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/update/download/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr.nbm:netbeans/config/Modules/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr.xml to /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/config/Modules/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr.xml\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: File installed /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar.pack.gz@0\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: Copied file /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/update/download/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr.nbm:netbeans/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar.pack.gz to /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar.pack.gz\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: Unpack /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar.pack.gz to /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: File /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar.pack.gz deleted.\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.updater]: Ignore non-readable files \r\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: /run/media/mbien/500GB 860EVO/nb_data/netbeans_20/cnd/modules/locale/org-netbeans-modules-cnd-antlr_ja.jar (No such file or directory)\r\n\tat java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.open0(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.open(FileInputStream.java:216)\r\n\tat java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:157)\r\n\tat org.netbeans.updater.UpdateTracking.getFileCRC(UpdateTracking.java:508)\r\n[catch] at org.netbeans.updater.ModuleUpdater.unpack(ModuleUpdater.java:470)\r\n\tat org.netbeans.updater.ModuleUpdater.run(ModuleUpdater.java:118)\r\n```\r\nand installation failed with:\r\n```\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.modules.autoupdate.services.InstallSupportImpl]: Timeout waiting for loading module org.netbeans.modules.cnd.api.remote@1.29.5.1\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.modules.autoupdate.ui.wizards.InstallStep]: timeout of loading C/C++ Remote Development API[org.netbeans.modules.cnd.api.remote/1.29.5.1]\r\norg.netbeans.api.autoupdate.OperationException[INSTALL]: timeout of loading C/C++ Remote Development API[org.netbeans.modules.cnd.api.remote/1.29.5.1]\r\n\tat org.netbeans.modules.autoupdate.services.InstallSupportImpl$3.call(InstallSupportImpl.java:431)\r\n\tat org.netbeans.modules.autoupdate.services.InstallSupportImpl$3.call(InstallSupportImpl.java:291)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:264)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1136)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:635)\r\n[catch] at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if someone would like to continue using the old release of the C/C++ support plugins. The easiest way to achieve this is to stick to NB 20 (soon NB 21 once released) and run NetBeans on JDK 11. \r\n\r\nNetBeans 22 will only support running on JDK 17, 21 and 22 and will fail during C/C++ plugin installation as demonstrated above (assuming this can't be easily fixed - I wouldn't put too much effort into this, but if someone wants to take a look: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/labels/Contribution%20welcome ;)).\r\n\r\nAnd as previously mentioned I think it would be a opportunity to also remove the NB 8.2 plugin portal from the preset list of NB 22. I might open a draft PR later. edit: here it is: #6991\r\n\r\n[CND](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/cnd) might make it back one day into NB in a properly supported manner, but work on that happens during spare time and the feature is not trivial to re-integrate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1908116060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1908421018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/5024#issuecomment-1908421018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5024","id":1908421018,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5xwDGa","user":{"login":"PavelTurk","id":10261361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjYxMzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10261361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk","html_url":"https://github.com/PavelTurk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PavelTurk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T15:57:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T15:57:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@TheMarvelFan Could you say if you are working on this issue?

For checkHints I needed to make a change in the CslTestBase but I'm not 100% sure whether I needed to do this or not. w/o my change the problem was that the hint was never triggered due to not writing the correct property for hints/suggestions (L4387: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4485/files#diff-afbe604d62e2e9bec89e4ed0e712ad047106ed77e63c2c4030e76a54d762941fR4387).\r\n\r\nFor the applyHint test, I also needed to change code within the CslTestBase in the method findApplicableFix (L4624: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4485/files#diff-afbe604d62e2e9bec89e4ed0e712ad047106ed77e63c2c4030e76a54d762941fR4624) from text == null to text != null. I'm also not 100% sure but the code makes more sense for me now. Otherwise it will always return null which breaks the code in applyHint (assertNotNull(fix))- This test is also funny, often it fails with that the expectation of the result is not the correct one but when I debug 1min or so with F8 to jump over the code, etc. it says that the test is green and I don't know what's wrong here.\r\n\r\nI also added a check for Error and Warning which was missing, because if Current_line_warning is false it is not that the rest is always an error or an warning. computeHints maybe is missnamed here. It will just check for html version, nothing else. So all in all the code is often very frustrating to check and I needed days for debugging and yes it could be that I don't understand the code 100% that's why I'm asking for a bit of help please.
