@williaster, thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nI read your first sentences to mean that I can bypass Superset and use the EventFlow vis itself; is this correct? How would I go about it? Sorry if this is a silly question, I am quite new to Superset.\r\n\r\nAbout the granularity, your guess is correct: in the web UI, there is a setting for the granularity, and it only goes down to minutes. Unfortunately, the Superset UI freezes on my entire dataset, and has serious problems even on a slice (small enough that it should not be a size issue). I will open an issue about this if I manage to write a minimal example that does not involve my data. This was to say that I do not know whether the vis itself would later allow me to change the granularity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/433758188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/433776737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5588#issuecomment-433776737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5588","id":433776737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzc3NjczNw==","user":{"login":"Rhysoshea","id":5739908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mzk5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5739908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea","html_url":"https://github.com/Rhysoshea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rhysoshea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-29T03:17:40Z","updated_at":"2018-10-29T03:17:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"hi @tanner-bruce did you try @villebro 's solution?
