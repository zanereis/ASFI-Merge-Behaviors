this should be all done now. I have squashed all the commits into a single one and pushed again. Unfortunately there are some build failures but they seem to be all unrelated (scala, some github issue with cub etc). They seem to pop up by today when I incorporated the latest MXNet code. Eric, can you take a look? May be you have an idea. Has something pushed recently that explains that?\r\n\r\nSummary of the changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a set of BLAS3/LAPACK based operators. This set is rich enough to support a set of interesting linear algebra applications including Gaussian processes (standalone or integrated with deep learning strategies for parameter estimation). There is already interest from several other sides specifically on the Cholesky factorization. \r\n- The operators are currently avail only for CPU but we are working on GPU support already and are committed to supply it based on cuSolver.\r\n- For the LAPACK operators (potrf,potri), a low level MXNet-specific abstraction has been implemented that enable us to switch the underlying LAPACK integration easily without going through the entire MXNet code. This abstraction currently supports only potrf/potri but can be extended easily whenever there is the need to make more lapack-functions available. \r\n- This low level abstraction is currently just for CPU. We may combine GPU and CPU together into a higher level abstraction when bringing in GPU-support.\r\n- The LAPACK-abstraction interfaces directly with the core Fortran-libraries on all platforms. This is the only consistent way as C-wrappers for lapack differ heavily between platforms and all lapack-packages that are relevant for us (and likely all other ones as well) use anyway the underlying Fortran library.  This is also the way numpy integrates lapack (just that numpy uses an extra utility to generate the C-declarations from the fortran library automatically). \r\n- Above method should be stable as the LAPACK-fortran interfaces are unlikely to change ever.\r\n- All of the usual BLAS-packages that we integrate with MXNet (openblas,apple,atlas,mkl) include lapack already by default. Smaller differences: On Ubuntu, the lapack library is not installed automatically with openblas, it must be installed explicitly. On Windows, blas and lapack are mangled into a single library. apple/atlas/mkl contain lapack  automatically. When using openblas, we have to add a linker flag to include liblapack. Makefiles, configuration files etc have been updated accordingly, also the installation documentation. \r\n\r\n- Whenever MXNet is compiled with one of the BLAS libraries openblas/atlas/mkl/apple as well as for all compiles on windows, a compiler flag -DMXNET_USE_LAPACK is set that will activate the LAPACK-abstraction in the C++ code and add the lapack library to the linker step (if necessary for the platform). If the compiler flag is not present, then dummy stubs will be generated in the C++ abstraction  that will cause a runtime error with appropriate error message whenever a lapack-function is called. This ensures that MXNET can always be compiled even when no lapack is available. Though as lapack will likely become soon a vital part of MXNet and is also available on all platforms, I think we will only use that for some potential special \"lightweight\" builds. \r\n\r\nOnce again, I would be happy if someone else can look into the mysterious build errors. I got all compiled clean before but now they pop up. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/306920725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/306921837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6538#issuecomment-306921837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6538","id":306921837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjkyMTgzNw==","user":{"login":"jli05","id":3519667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3519667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05","html_url":"https://github.com/jli05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T20:54:53Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T20:54:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry what build errors exactly?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/306921837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/306923017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/6538#issuecomment-306923017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6538","id":306923017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjkyMzAxNw==","user":{"login":"jli05","id":3519667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk2Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3519667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05","html_url":"https://github.com/jli05","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jli05/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T20:58:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T20:58:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In `c_lapack_api.h`, all functions follow the same signature.

In the backend, `infer_partial_shape` and `infer_shape` do the same thing, except that `infer_partial_shape` would return shape inference results even though some shapes cannot be inferred, while `infer_shape` would print error messages (what shapes cannot be inferred) and return `None`. simple_bind needs complete shape inference results to continue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/307453800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/307456187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/6630#issuecomment-307456187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6630","id":307456187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzQ1NjE4Nw==","user":{"login":"patwa67","id":23460133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDYwMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23460133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67","html_url":"https://github.com/patwa67","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patwa67/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-09T17:52:12Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T17:52:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"And
