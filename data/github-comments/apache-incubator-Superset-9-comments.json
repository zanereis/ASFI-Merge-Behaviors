While this is nice, it makes it harder to add new visualization to the framework. \n\nMaybe individual visualization can have different level of support for the framework's more advanced features (like contextual menus), and grow that over time. The downside of that is an uneven user experience across visualizations, where you might expect to be able to right click on the treemap, but the contextual menu hasn't been implemented for that specific visualization yet...\n\nIt's important for me to keep the contract simple so that we can grow a wide array of visualizations. \n\n@williaster
