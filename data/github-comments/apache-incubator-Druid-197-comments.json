We probably should clarify if the intention of `maxRowsPerSegment`, i.e. should reaching it handoff immediately as one might expect, or should it continue accumulating rows in other segments until one goes over the threshold, as matching the behavior of this patch in the kafka indexing task would cause that test to fail. I don't feel strongly either way, but I do think the current behavior is probably surprising to most people, however the way it is might be slightly better in terms of giving a small window to increase the number of rows in any other segments that might not yet be full.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/411539025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/411541340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6125#issuecomment-411541340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6125","id":411541340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTU0MTM0MA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T20:28:36Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T20:28:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think it is going to make a huge difference either way.

As you can see in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/distribution/pom.xml, `mvn install` does more things other than pulling libraries to build the distribution tarball. I think we can simply skip this if some option like `-Pdist` is not specified.

the worker affinity approach is a reasonable way to go. An alternative is to use the \"taskResource\" object to configure how many slots a task takes. You can make a task take 2, 3, or more slots by doing:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"taskResource\" : {\r\n  \"requiredCapacity\" : 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is not a very commonly used feature, but it can make it easier to support heterogenous task sizing. To keep the scheduler simple, we only support slot multiples, not customization of the exact amount of CPU and memory requested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/412724797/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/412739420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5772#issuecomment-412739420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5772","id":412739420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjczOTQyMA==","user":{"login":"rahmantasnim","id":10445535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ1NTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10445535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim","html_url":"https://github.com/rahmantasnim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahmantasnim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T03:05:30Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T03:05:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'd be down to work on this, but I want to check that you're okay with a potential performance detriment.

To execute 10K queries per min, each query should take at most 6 ms if all they are run in sequential. But, Druid is capable of running queries in parallel, so this shouldn't be a problem. And this is why I said the number of queries matters. How many queries are you running? 10K queries per minute?\r\n\r\n@jon-wei good point. I forgot the `affinity` configuration. That would address this issue.\r\n\r\n@gianm thanks for the comment but not sure about `taskResource`. AFAIK, `processing` threads are used for query processing in peons. Does `taskResource` affect to the `processing` configuration too? Or, does it have an effect that a MM is allocated less tasks, so that each task can use more `processing` threads?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/412744634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/412752366","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6171#issuecomment-412752366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6171","id":412752366,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjc1MjM2Ng==","user":{"login":"pdeva","id":3190176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTAxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3190176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva","html_url":"https://github.com/pdeva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T04:37:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T04:37:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"the
