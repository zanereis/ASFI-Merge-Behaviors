If I understand correctly the issue is similar - a new connection might be established before listeners would see the expired event if the thread delivering the expired event is delayed. I think this can be solved at Curator level by delaying the creation of a new connection until all the listeners are notified of the expired event.</p>\n\n<p>What I've tried is to separate ConnectionState.checkState into two methods: one determining the current state and one handling the event (calling reset() if necessary). If you think this would be a good solution I can prepare a PR for it.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604750999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604751004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/887#issuecomment-2604751004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/887","id":2604751004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NTEwMDQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T13:39:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:33:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p>Please submit the PR and we can review it from there.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604751004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604743629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/840#issuecomment-2604743629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/840","id":2604743629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NDM2Mjk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T17:01:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:30:09Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=runningfly\">runningfly</a>:</i>\n<p>If it helps, I did write some code to treat the symptoms. I never felt like I had a good enough understanding of Curator to create a proper patch. <br/>\nThese are the workaround changes I made to \"org.apache.curator.x.discovery.details.ServiceDiscoveryImpl\". It doesn't completely eliminate the problem but It does help it recover and avoid it from getting stuck in an indeterminate loop. It essentially aborts the reregister if the connection drops and start over. Every time it fails it waits a little longer before retrying. This helps to soften the load on the ZK server during a sudden connection recovery. Its far from ideal but it works and has gotten us by for months.</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">/**\n  * A mechanism to register and query service instances using ZooKeeper\n@@ -66,17 +70,16 @@\n   <span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">final</span> Collection<ServiceProvider<T>> providers = Sets\n   .newSetFromMap(Maps.<ServiceProvider<T>, <span class=\"code-object\">Boolean</span>> newConcurrentMap());\n   <span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">final</span> <span class=\"code-object\">boolean</span> watchInstances;\n+\n+  <span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> ExecutorService reRegisterExecutor = ThreadUtils.newSingleThreadExecutor(<span class=\"code-quote\">\"reRegister\"</span>);\n+  <span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">volatile</span> Future< ? > reRegisterFuture = <span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>;\n+  <span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"code-object\">int</span> reRegisterRetryCount = 0;\n   <span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> <span class=\"code-keyword\">final</span> ConnectionStateListener connectionStateListener = <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> ConnectionStateListener() {\n     @Override\n     <span class=\"code-keyword\">public</span> void stateChanged(CuratorFramework client, ConnectionState newState) {\n       <span class=\"code-keyword\">if</span> ((newState == ConnectionState.RECONNECTED) || (newState == ConnectionState.CONNECTED)) {\n-<span class=\"code-keyword\">try</span> {\n-  log.debug(<span class=\"code-quote\">\"Re-registering due to reconnection\"</span>);\n-  reRegisterServices();\n-} <span class=\"code-keyword\">catch</span> (Exception e) {\n-  ThreadUtils.checkInterrupted(e);\n-  log.error(<span class=\"code-quote\">\"Could not re-register instances after reconnection\"</span>, e);\n-}\n+log.warn(<span class=\"code-quote\">\"Reconnection event.
