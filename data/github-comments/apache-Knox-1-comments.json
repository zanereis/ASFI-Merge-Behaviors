I can double check in a bit, but it seems like if the check is in the bash script, the script would fail BEFORE java is even started. This would mean that there is no success message printed?\r\n\r\nYes, I'm.\r\nIf the folder check is moved to Java layer then the `appStart` function will execute the Java process and will check for the PID file being created; once it finds it considers the startup process finished with success. It may happen that the Java process did not reach the validation at this time (so that it has not thrown the corresponding exception yet) -> the PID file won't be removed.\r\nAn easy to implement solution could be to give a bit more time - let's say 2 seconds - to the Java process before the first time PID check (by this time the validation would fail and the Java process would return with 1).\r\nIdeally, the check should not rely only on the PID file being created; some sort of heartbeat would be helpful or implementing a basic state machine in the Gateway server (STOPPED, INITIALIZING, STARTED, STOPPING)...but this is out of the scope of this task.\r\nAny objection?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/471690200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/471999184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/68#issuecomment-471999184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/68","id":471999184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTk5OTE4NA==","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-12T13:25:52Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T13:25:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@risdenk \r\nAdditional information: working on the bash script enhancement JIRA now and adding a 1-second wait before the first PID check solves the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/471999184/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
