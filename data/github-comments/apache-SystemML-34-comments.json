The IDE will automatically alert you to syntax issues (currently Eclipse says that there are 6 syntax errors) and can also make it very easy to run the test classes in order to verify that they work. There is a lot of general information on the web that can be found regarding Eclipse/IntelliJ/Maven/Java, and most of this information applies to SystemML since it is essentially a regular Java

@feihugis - just to clarify the modification of ParForProgramBlock is conceptually unnecessary because CachableData::export would only write if the matrix object is \"dirty\" (i.e., its in-memory representation differs from its hdfs representation), the write goes into a different file system, format, persistent write, or there are pending RDD operations. However, we recently changed the file scheme handling and the handling of pending RDD operations is non-trivial - so there might be internal bugs. Since this primitive is called from many different places, we should fix the internals and not try to patch it from outside. I don't have time tonight but can look into this tomorrow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/319281606/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/319281617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/578#issuecomment-319281617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/578","id":319281617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTI4MTYxNw==","user":{"login":"bertholdreinwald","id":10200727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAwNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10200727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald","html_url":"https://github.com/bertholdreinwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T06:36:31Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T06:36:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"can you please hold off a few more days.

The indexing expressions have been updated.  I'm guessing the reason you did not meet the export issues on parfor may be that the program exits before entering the export part due to the indexing issues. Could you test it again?

is very extremely useful Niketan! Thank you for such a great contribution. LGTM with a couple comments:\r\n\r\n1) Could the Java MLContext.getHopDag methods be moved to static MLContextUtil.getHopDag methods (and include an MLContext method parameter too to get the various settings) and called from the Python MLContext?\r\n  My thinking:\r\n  a) Output is in Python graphviz format which is used from python but not java/scala.\r\n      Example: `digraph {h5[label=\"u(print)[1:0-1:19]\", shape=\"octagon\", color=\"yellow\", tooltip=\"[-1 X -1], nnz=-1, mem= [in=0, inter=0, out=0 -> 0MB]\"];\r\nrankdir = \"BT\"}`\r\n  b) MLContext Java class is very lightweight by design (notice how few parameters tend to exist on the MLContext method signatures). The MLContextUtil class tends to hold such code so far in the API.\r\n\r\n2) Nice to have:\r\n  a) Javadoc all methods if they're in the MLContext API (public facing code).\r\n  b) Auto-format the MLContext API Java code with one of SystemML's code formats (in dev/code-style)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/319526842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/319530791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/601#issuecomment-319530791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/601","id":319530791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTUzMDc5MQ==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T00:07:28Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T00:07:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer

thanks for working on this. However, this change only modifies the existing FunctionCallCP lop and hence you see all these test failures. Please, try to create a new lop FunctionCallSingleCP (or some better name) which follows the simple instruction generation of all the other lops (most importantly, you don't need to maintain the outputs anymore but simply take the provided output name from getInstructions(String[] inputs, String[] outputs)). Then also modify the FunctionOp by (1) adding a flag for single function invocations, and (2) conditionally on that flag compile either a FunctionCallCP or FunctionCallCPSingle on constructLops.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/320489187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/320489887","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/605#issuecomment-320489887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/605","id":320489887,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDQ4OTg4Nw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-06T07:03:46Z","updated_at":"2017-08-06T07:04:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, as expressed before, adding more of such special case operators concerns me a bit.
