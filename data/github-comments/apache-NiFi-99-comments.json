agree with the points made by @joewitt , although this PR did make me compare what we are doing for processors vs. controller services...\r\n \r\nI noticed that for processors the try/catch wraps the Class.forName AND the newInstance() call, and then creates a ghost component if an exception is thrown, where as controller services only catch exceptions from Class.forName and anything outside of that would not create a ghost component.\r\n\r\nTechnically exceptions from Class.forName would be the ones that indicate the class for the component is not present, and exceptions from newInstance() would indicate an exception thrown from the constructor.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure which is more correct, or if anything should be changed, but I did notice the difference in behavior, and some of the changes in this PR seem to be for making the controller service behavior more similar to processors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/427835814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/427888889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3049#issuecomment-427888889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3049","id":427888889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzg4ODg4OQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T15:59:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T15:59:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
