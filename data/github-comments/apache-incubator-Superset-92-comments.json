when is the order of records returned by the `query` function significant?\r\n\r\nLooking at `SqlaTable.query()`, I think that:\r\n\r\n* if `columns` is set then `orderby` is used to determine the order\r\n* if `groupby` is set then the `main_metric_expr` is used (in descending order) to order the groups\r\n* if there are metrics (and therefore `columns == []`) but no `groupby` then there is no `order by` and the rows will be returned in the order of the SQL groups, which will include the `__timestamp` column even when `groupby == []`,\r\n\r\nIs it important that when `is_timeseries == True` the rows are returned in `__timestamp` order?\r\n\r\nI assume not, because then we have both `is_timeseries` and `groupby` then `SqlaTable` still returns the rows by `main_metrics_expr` in descending

the Travis-CI run for the PR fails because it doesn't run the migration for PandasConnector, but I can't fix that until I know whether you want to:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the migration in the `contrib` directory and update `cli.py` to allow multiple migration locations\r\n2. Keep the migration in the main `superset/migration/versions` directory - which simplifies running and maintaining the migrations but will create a tighter link between PandasConnector and the main code.\r\n\r\nPlease can you look at the PR when you get a chance and let me know which way you want me to set it
