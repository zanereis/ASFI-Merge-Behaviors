The ratoinale behind recreating KafkaSystemProducer was based upon the recommendation I received from few members of kafka team. It was claimed that some SSL excpetions in producer  are irrecoverable and it will be better to retry  by recreating the producer instance from samza side. \r\n\r\nNow if that is unnecessary and existing SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer implementation throws up on the first occurrence of any kafka exceptions. Do you think it will be useful to add configurable, fixed retries on kafka exceptions in `SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer` implementation rather than failing repeatedly after first occurrence of exception. By this we can get the following benefits: \r\n\r\n1. First occurrence of exception in the `SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer` wouldn't make the `SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer` instance unusable.\r\n2. Retries would be closer to the kafka i/o layer where we can decide whether to retry on specific retriable exceptions thrown by kafka. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

Here is the summary:\r\n\r\n1) There is no irrecoverable in KafkaProducer.\r\n\r\n2) `SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer.send(String source, OutgoingMessageEnvelope envelope)` sends message asynchronously and it does not provide way to tell caller whether a given message has been sent successfully. Thus we are using the `fatalException` to tell whether there has been any message send() failure. As long term solution, we need to improve this API design, probably similar to KafkaProducer's API, so that caller can tell whether any given message has been sent successfully. T\r\n\r\n3) Due to the issue explained above, `SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer` will fail persistently after one send() failure. Thus we need to re-instantiate producer after each failure. This is the approach adopted in this PR.\r\n\r\n4) Another issue is that, currently `KafkaCheckpointManager` will retry using exponential backoff starting from 100 ms up to 10 sec per back-off. This means that up to 4 attempts can be made in the first second which seems too much. In general it seems simpler to just use the constant retry backoff similar to what KafkaProducer already does.\r\n\r\n@shanthoosh Given the summary above, I would prefer that we go directly to implement the long term solution. But the short term solution as implemented in the current PR also seems OK. Due to the issue in 2) above, I don't think we should add retry logic in `SamzaLiKafkaSystemProducer` -- if we do so, caller may think the send() has succeeded even if the send() has failed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/438810802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/439161427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/792#issuecomment-439161427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/792","id":439161427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTE2MTQyNw==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T19:28:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T19:39:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@shanthoosh
