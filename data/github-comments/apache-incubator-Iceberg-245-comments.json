Caffeine cache will not always call removelistener by default, so an extra scheduler is required to invoke removelistener.\r\n\r\nFrom how I understand how Caffeine does this is that it performs the cleanup whenever the cache is being accessed or modified. Below is an excerpt from the Javadoc:\r\n\r\n> If expireAfter, expireAfterWrite, or expireAfterAccess is requested then entries may be evicted on each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to Cache.cleanUp.

guys,\r\n\r\nI am very happy to see this discussion on migrating test framework to `Junit5`, which will bring great benefits to the testing part of the project. For example, stronger support for parameterized test and better support for lambda expressions.\r\n\r\nSince the `Apache Flink` community has already started migrating tests to `Junit5` and `Assertj` a long time ago, maybe we can learn something from it. In short, It adopted a `module-by-module` migration solution, and you can refer to this umbrella [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25325). \r\n\r\n\r\n> It's worth looking at https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#migrating-from-junit4.\r\n\r\nIt is really a good reference to start. At the same time, I would like to share the [migration guidance]([JUnit5 migration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1514Wa_aNB9bJUen4xm5uiuXOooOJTtXqS_Jqk9KJitU/edit)) of the flink community for your reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n> It's also worth mentioning that there are scripts available to convert assertions: https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-migration\r\n\r\nThis script does most of the boring migration stuff. However, according to my experience, there are still some special cases that it cannot handle, such as converting `try{} catch(expected exception)` to `Assertions.assertThatThrowBy`. However, there are not many such exceptions. We can run this script first and spend a little more time to manually handle some special cases.\r\n\r\n> Things like @Rule public TemporaryFolder temp = new TemporaryFolder(); don't work in JUni5 and would have to be converted to @TempDir Path temp;.\r\n\r\nYes, something like this does the more tedious part of the migration process.\r\n\r\n I also want to share another similar case:\r\n\r\n`Juint5` has much better support for parameterized tests to avoid separating parameterized and non-parameterized parts into different test classes. But this also brings some troubles to our migration, because many of our previous tests were parameterized for the whole class, but now we have to inject parameters for each method.\r\nIn order to avoid the inconvenience caused by the above problems as much as possible, we have done some work in flink:\r\n- Introduce `ParameterizedTestExtension` and some annotations to make it easier to migrate test class that require parameterization for all methods.\r\n- Introduce `TempDirUtils` to provide some common methods in `org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder` but for `Junit5`.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please refer to this [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25315).\r\n\r\nOf course, I am also very willing to participate in the migration of iceberg's test framework, and I look forward to taking this opportunity to integrate into this great community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1507348739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1507354068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7330#issuecomment-1507354068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7330","id":1507354068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Z2GXU","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-13T17:31:10Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T17:31:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

Thank you for your contributions!\r\n> \r\n> I have a question regarding the overall solution for the issue addressed in this PR. Please forgive me if this is a silly one. I recall that the namemapping JSON object allows for specifying multiple names for a field. Would it be possible to solve the case sensitivity issue by specifying alternate field names in the namemapping? Are there any real-world scenarios that would prevent us from modifying the namemapping and necessitate the solution presented in this PR? I look forward to hearing your insights on this matter.\r\n\r\nThe issue we encountered happens when building iceberg table from hive table where hive table already has schema name case mismatch between its parquet file and table schema. While your solution should work, but overall I feel it adds more complexity given that case insensitivity support is already there for other places in iceberg.

one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1507848954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1507850136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7160#issuecomment-1507850136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7160","id":1507850136,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Z3_eY","user":{"login":"reswqa","id":19502505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTAyNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19502505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa","html_url":"https://github.com/reswqa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T02:40:54Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T02:41:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @jackye1995 for the quick reply!\r\n\r\n> Regarding Junit5 vs AssertJ Assertions, what did Flink community do?\r\n\r\nEarlier, many different types of assertions were mixed in Flink's codebase, such as `Junit4` assertion, `Hamcrest`,`some custom assertion`, etc. \r\n\r\nWhile migrating to `Junit5`, Flink community decided that use `AssertJ` as the only assertion framework.\r\n\r\n> Do you think using AssertJ Assertions (which seems to be the consensus above) is preferred over Junit5?\r\n\r\nIn my personal experience, `AssertJ` is really powerful and the benefit speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to its chained assertion style, we can avoid writing a lot of redundant code.\r\n- It has truly helpful error messages.\r\n- It provides a dedicated assertion API for many types, which will greatly reduce the burden of writing tests and increase the readability of the code.\r\n- Provides assertions for Guava types like Multimap, Table, Optional or ByteSource.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1507850136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1508024678","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7330#issuecomment-1508024678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7330","id":1508024678,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Z4qFm","user":{"login":"gaborkaszab","id":29145491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborkaszab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T07:02:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T07:02:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks

IIRC we have a specific PR for adding this feature for non partitioned tables and another one for partitioned tables. So you should look for multiple PRs if you want to see the full picture.\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer. I thought this implementation is in the iceberg code before, so I couldn't find it. Now I have found these pr in the hive code\r\n
