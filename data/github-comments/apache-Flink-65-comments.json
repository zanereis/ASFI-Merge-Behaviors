Do you think it's a good idea to merge it into the CompletedCheckpointStore?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145557954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145571671","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1226#issuecomment-145571671","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1226","id":145571671,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTU3MTY3MQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-05T15:33:10Z","updated_at":"2015-10-05T15:33:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it would be great to add a little more on this, in a dedicated section, like for some other parameters.

I think we cannot do much about it being a temporary workaround for the limitation that our `ExecutionGraph` is not serializable.

This should be fixed imo.\n\nMoreover, I think I've found a race condition. The `RuntimeMonitorHandler` checks whether the current leader is its own or a remote one. If it's the local JM, then the respective RequestHandler is called. Within the `RequestHandler`, such as `CurrentJobsOverviewHandler` the `JobManagerArchiverRetriever` is called again. If now the leader has changed to be a remote JM, then we'll have a problem.

I think the proposal in your description to let the client-side (TMs) 1. check whether they have the file cached, 2. check the filesystem backend and 3.

IMHO, it would be better to add an abstraction so that the effective backend to distribute the Jars can be easily swapped. \n\nFurthermore, I couldn't find a check whether the user provided `STATE_BACKEND_FS_RECOVERY_PATH` path points actually to a distributed file system and is, thus, accessible by the TMs. Maybe we could add a check which, if false, will give a comprehensive

Of course, having to store this information in two places[`ExecutionEnvironment` and `RuntimeContext`] is poor design. \nIf the job is being run in detached mode, the accumulators are lost and user can never access them or use them.\nBut disallowing accumulators will effectively break most of existing programs. So that's bad choice.\nEager execution functions use just accumulators actually, so, to maintain harmony, we have to maintain them too.\nIf we just consider the first commit of this PR which adds support for executing detached jobs, on a eager call, the main program throws an exception, because the job execution result doesn't contain any accumulators.\n\n``` java\nthis.flatMap(new Utils.CollectHelper<T>(id, serializer)).name(\"collect()\")\n    .output(new DiscardingOutputFormat<T>()).name(\"collect() sink\");\nJobExecutionResult res = getExecutionEnvironment().execute();\n```\n\nI'm really not sure how to handle accumulators in detached programs. What we can do is:\nIn `JobExecutionResult`, whenever an accumulator is requested, we check for the runtime to be -1, which indicates job was exited in detached mode. Display  a warning to the user on the Cli itself and indicate that the results of accumulators are available on the web frontend [which will require writing them to a file on the job manager]. \nOne more thing: Since the detached mode is available on Yarn, it must throw the exception too in case of `collect` or `print` calls. Is this the case? I can't check on a yarn cluster myself.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145824055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145838136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/593#issuecomment-145838136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/593","id":145838136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTgzODEzNg==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-06T12:08:17Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T12:08:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

the sake of completeness I repost what I've just commented on the last commit:\n\nI think it would be better to move the `JobManager` retrieval logic into the `JobClientActor`. Then the `JobClientActor` would be responsible for finding the current leader and resubmit the `JobGraph`. The `Client` would simply wait for the `JobExecutionResult` or an `Exception`.\n\nThat way, we would unify the retry logic in one place which would reduce a little bit of complexity.\n\nSince @uce is quite overloaded right now, I can take a shot at it.

I fully agree that it's not a good way to do it, but this is blocking #1153. Is that OK?\n- There is no check for the provided path. It's the same behaviour as the configured checkpoint directory `STATE_BACKEND_FS_DIR`. I think the check would have to be performed on the task managers. A check for \"file://\" does not suffice, because this can also be a DFS. I would open a issue for this and then fix it for the `STATE_BACKEND_FS_DIR` as well.\n- I'm still undecided about the shutdown hook.

The detached YARN execution mode is broken for jobs which use eager execution and build other jobs using the results. However, the detached YARN execution could work if the ApplicationMaster executed the program. Essentially, this means shifting the Client to the YARN cluster.\n\n@StephanEwen The way Sachin was going to handle the eager execution during detached mode is to throw an Exception. However, the current code doesn't handle all cases. It is in the nature of an interactive session that multiple jobs can be submitted. Results from submitted jobs can be reused not only via count/collect but also using the returned JobExecutionResult. Therefore, it is very difficult to deal with all these cases. IMHO we can only support non-interactive detached job submissions.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a nice idea but implementing it has too much overhead. The implications of the changes are not quite clear. I pledge to change this to \"Won't Fix\" until we think about a proper implementation. In the meantime, we should fix the detached YARN mode or remove it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145949994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145957532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/593#issuecomment-145957532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/593","id":145957532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTk1NzUzMg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-06T18:32:36Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T18:32:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot @twalthr for rebasing the pull request.

We need to have a proper handling of eager execution, and why exactly it shouldn't be allowed. The client exits is not a very good explanation from the user viewpoint, and it might end up breaking programs.\nFurther, the collect call is used in other API methods as well, for example, in Gelly. Detached mode in the current version will lead to failure of every such code.\n\nOne question: What exactly is the significance of a detached submission and what does the user expect when they submit the job in detached mode? From what I understand, it should mean that the user should be able to shut down the machine on which the client is present. They should be able to monitor the output for however long they want, stop and resume at a later point. I'm drawing the analogy from how the `screen` program works on linux systems. \nAccording to this understanding of mine, the following organization would make sense:\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8874261/10319971/8d272436-6c8e-11e5-802c-ba8330a6c9c6.PNG)\n\nHowever, if the executor program is in the job manager actor system, what happens in case of a failure? Can we recover the state of the main thread, its memory space etc. on a different leader?\n\nI hope that added something to a discussion that is now bound to happen on detached mode. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145972139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/145974916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/593#issuecomment-145974916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/593","id":145974916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTk3NDkxNg==","user":{"login":"aalexandrov","id":1071946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzE5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1071946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov","html_url":"https://github.com/aalexandrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aalexandrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-06T19:38:28Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T19:38:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mxm The issue is probably related to Scala 2.10, since the two passing builds have `Dscala-2.11`.
