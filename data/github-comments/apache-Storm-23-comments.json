one Spout/Bolt can register metric twice with same name in different timeBucket</p>\n\n<p>    In a Bolt's prepare method, we can register metrics twice with the same name, using different timeBucketSizeInSecs parameter, like this:<br/>\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    public void prepare(Map stormConf, TopologyContext context)</p>\n    { \nmapper = new ObjectMapper(); \nCountMetric cMetric = new CountMetric(); \ncontext.registerMetric(\"JavaBoltCount\", cMetric, 120); \nCountMetric ccMetric = new CountMetric(); \ncontext.registerMetric(\"JavaBoltCount\", ccMetric, 60); \n    }\n<p>    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n    This is caused by TopologyContext's registerMetric. <br/>\n    In TopologyContext, all registered metrics holds in a map defined below:<br/>\n    private Map<Integer,Map<Integer, Map<String, IMetric>>> _registeredMetrics;<br/>\n    timeBucketSizeInSecs ----> __taskId ----> metricName ----> metirc<br/>\n    But the same name check just at the innermost layer.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request
