BTW, in my opinion, there are too many duplicated classes in Thrift-based TajoCli. I think that it would be better if we reuse TajoClient code.

I'm happy to see such a nice work . I leave some comments.\n- The main objective is to add a self diagnosis phase to every components. But, the patch includes the core rule engine. So, we need to choice one of the followings:\n  - We can add the self diagonisis phase which uses the core rule engine\n  - We can create another jira for only core rule engine and make another patch for TAJO-1143\n  - We can change the title of this jira.\n\nIn addition, this rule engine is designed to verify the rules. I can ensure it from ValidationFailedException. BTW, many class names seem to be too generic like RuleSession.

Since Hadoop dependency will be removed from TajoClient (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAJO-1160), only TajoConf verification would be necessary in TajoClient.\n\nCheers,\nHyunsik\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65757536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65758611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/280#issuecomment-65758611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/280","id":65758611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzU4NjEx","user":{"login":"ykrips","id":8876874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzY4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips","html_url":"https://github.com/ykrips","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-05T08:06:33Z","updated_at":"2014-12-05T08:06:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your quick review.\nI agree with your suggestion, and will fix up my patch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65758611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65761937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/280#issuecomment-65761937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/280","id":65761937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzYxOTM3","user":{"login":"ykrips","id":8876874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzY4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips","html_url":"https://github.com/ykrips","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-05T08:48:00Z","updated_at":"2014-12-05T08:48:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@hyunsik,\nI have uploaded a modified patch set to this issue.

I briefly investigated it in order to give good reviews. I'm still reviewing it. I'll give more comments soon.\n\nNow, I have one suggestion or discussion agenda related to this issue. It would be nice if ultimately we have a direction like **INFORMATION SCHEMA** (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_schema). You may already know this concept more than me. It is required for Tajo to follow ANSI SQL standard. \n\nBTW, I don't think that we have to do it in this issue. We can commit your current work now, and mark it as an experimental and evolving feature, Then, we change it later if other committers agree with my suggestion. I'd also like to help this work.\n\nThe following is my suggestion for the future. There may be two approaches to achieve `INFORMATION SCHEMA`.\n\nOne is that we change current schemas to follow `INFORMATION SCHEMA`. But, this approach requires lots of burden. Also, it may be hard to optimize table schemas for our system characteristics.\n\nAnother approach is to provide virtual tables for `INFORMATION SCHEMA`. Actually, we don't need to have catalog schemas which are physically equivalent to `INFORMATION SCHEMA`. For example, Postgresql uses different schemas to maintain its catalog, but it provides a virtual table to show information schema. I think that we can do like them.\n- information schema of pgsql - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/information-schema.html\n- internal catalog schema of pgsql - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/catalogs.html\n\nHow do you think about my future direction?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65762633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65782990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/273#issuecomment-65782990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/273","id":65782990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzgyOTkw","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-05T12:22:01Z","updated_at":"2014-12-05T12:22:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your great discussion!\nIMHO, the second approach using virtual tables looks good. \nBTW, I also looked over the latest patch.

@hyunsik,\nYes, information schema is definitely ansi standard, and it would be better if we follow this standard. I agree with your opinion that implementing information schema is needed to split into multiple tasks, and catalog store and any other components needs to change to handle more information. It requires more time, and adopting a new feature could need lots of efforts on it.\nAnd let's talk about the strategy on information schema implementation. I would like to vote the second approach. I think that the first one would limit the capability of Tajo. When Tajo supports the view on it, we can define the information schema with this view feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65966012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/65966314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/290#issuecomment-65966314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/290","id":65966314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTY2MzE0","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-08T01:35:56Z","updated_at":"2014-12-08T01:35:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In addition, I added the table property 'timezone'.

If so, Amazon will provide the script and Tajo release tarball on their S3.\n\nIf you are Ok, I can help you submit the patch to Amazon's repo.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/66257171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/66399315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/294#issuecomment-66399315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/294","id":66399315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mzk5MzE1","user":{"login":"jinossy","id":3632397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzIzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3632397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy","html_url":"https://github.com/jinossy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-10T03:25:00Z","updated_at":"2014-12-10T03:25:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hyunsik \nCould you fix the compilation error ?\n\n```\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:2.5.1:compile (default-compile) on project tajo-catalog-common: Compilation failure\n[ERROR] /Users/kimjh/asf-patch/incubator-tajo/tajo-catalog/tajo-catalog-common/src/main/java/org/apache/tajo/catalog/CatalogUtil.java:[57,47] cannot find symbol\n[ERROR] symbol  : method isAlphabetic(char)\n[ERROR] location: class java.lang.Character\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/66399315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/66405440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/294#issuecomment-66405440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/294","id":66405440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDA1NDQw","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-10T05:08:51Z","updated_at":"2014-12-10T05:08:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I missed checking the compilation in JVM 6.

It's really great work. This work also includes the beginning of generic storage plugin. It's a nice starting work.\n\nI have one comment. In this patch, tajo-common/org.apache.tajo.json is moved org.apache.tajo.storage.json. Although it's not related to the purpose of this issue, this move touches lots of files. It's because GsonObject and CommonGsonHelper are widely used in the system.\n\nSo, I'd like to suggest move back it to org.apache.tajo.json.
