I tracked down the root cause of the \"Popen\" differences I had in mind. Now I know why I thought it was related to Popen. It was in fact`json.loads()` behaviour difference that caused our often problems where we developed in 3.6 and run in 3.5.  \r\n\r\nIn python3 (both 3.5 and 3.6) `check_output()` always produces bytes (in 2.7 it was `str` of course). \r\n\r\nBut json.loads() in python 2.7 and 3.5 can only consume `str`. Fortunately (or unfortunately) In python3.6 - `json.loads()` can also consume \"utf-8\" encoded bytes (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#json).\r\n\r\nWe often (for setting up/tearing down test environment) run gcloud command that produces json output that we then parse and use in python to do something (for example kill all running compute instances). \r\n\r\nSo then the problem is that `json.loads(subprocess.check_output())` works in python 2.7 (with 'str') and in python 3.6 (with bytes) but does not work for 3.5 (json.loads() cannot consume bytes). \r\n\r\nIt can be easily fixed with `json.loads(subprocess.check_output().decode(\"utf-8\"))` which works on all versions. But it is super-easy to forget about it when your main development environment is 3.6 :)\r\nHere is some easily reproducible example run in python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6:\r\n\r\n## Python 2.7\r\n```\r\n[potiuk:~/code/airflow-breeze/workspaces/polidea/airflow] AIRFLOW-3710-fix-warnings-in-Google-Cloud-Base-Hook(+1/-1)+ 27m45s ± python2.7\r\nPython 2.7.10 (default, Aug 17 2018, 19:45:58)\r\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.0.42)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import json;

But if we're waiting for a task, the nice points you raised should come into our consideration.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that we re-scan that DAG and check whether the `external_task_id` is in the latest task list of that DAG.

- I am pushing an updated version. I know that famous quote, but I think in this case cache invalidation works in our favour. That quote really is about that you never know when to do the invalidation and in our case we will do very smart invalidation (as explained in detail in your question about implicit dependencies). PTAL and let me know if the strategy I explained makes sense to you.\r\n\r\nActually we could even build in some mechanism to invalidate such cashe automatically from time to time. \r\n\r\nMy whole problem with the current image is that it should not simply be done as is today - in the way that the whole image is always build from the scratch. There is totally no need for that and it has the nasty side effect for the users that it will pollute their docker lib directory with a lot of unused, frequently invalidated images.\r\n\r\nIn this case the problem is with cache invalidation on the user side in fact. Docker does not know when an already downloaded image will not be needed so it will cache it until someone does 'docker system prune'. Otherwise the /var/lib/docker library will grow forever for someone who will regularly pull airflow

With [advanced build settings of Dockerhub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced/) we can very easily configure custom builds and have full control over caching and building images for both - tags and master \r\n\r\nHere is the work-in-progress of the POC (I will be testing it today):\r\nhttps://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow/commit/16ffadaadf72eb598cb48de9c33168f804e38079\r\n\r\nIt allows to build master-> airflow:latest images with incremental layers as described above, but then every time a new release is created - i.e. tag matching appropriate regex is pushed -  the whole image can be rebuilt from the scratch based on AIRFLOW_TAG custom build argument that you can pass. I put the AIRFLOW_TAG argument at the beginning of the Dockerfile which means that it will invalidate the whole cache and rebuild it from the scratch for every different TAG we build.\r\n\r\nThis way you can actually re-test (automatically) if rebuilding of the whole image from the scratch stlil works when you do RC builds. Without any additional effort nor actions from release manager, it will all be automated. It's just the matter of defining appropriate regex rules that will mach the tags or branches you want to build and subscribing to notifications whether the build did not fail.\r\n\r\nIt also allows to build anyone their own copy of Airflow image in their own Dockerhub based on their own branches - very useful for anyone who would make any changes to Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455439058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455504778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4548#issuecomment-455504778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4548","id":455504778,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTUwNDc3OA==","user":{"login":"abitrolly","id":8781107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3ODExMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8781107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly","html_url":"https://github.com/abitrolly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abitrolly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T10:45:55Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T10:46:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We don't test UI stuff currently\r\n\r\nHmm..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455504778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/455506851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4543#issuecomment-455506851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4543","id":455506851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTUwNjg1MQ==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-18T10:53:54Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T10:56:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Having to regularly invalidate the cache would take away a couple of my concerns.
