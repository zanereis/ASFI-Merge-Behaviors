This very steep learning curve makes it very hard for anyone else to contribute, in turn increasing risk if support and maintenance end up being on one person's shoulders only. (yours)\r\nThe only reason I powered through is because, without Jakarta, FreeMarker is likely to die alone (frameworks such as Spring drive the adoption/decline of many other projects) and that would be a pity. Due to the Jakarta migration, Spring 6 shipped with a very minimalistic version of FreeMarker, which greatly diminishes its value unfortunately.\r\n\r\nBranch `3` is missing features (from the top of my head `withArgs` is one of them) so even if the git history has diverged, there is still a big risk of breaking backwards compatibility from a feature perspective.\r\nFreeMarker being a templating engine, I believe its main focus should be on feature parity/compatibility/BC rather than API BC.\r\n\r\nMany of the artifacts relying on it on [mvnrepository.com](http://mvnrepository.com/) seem to be packaging it as part of web or email frameworks, without necessarily extending FM capabilities. (admittedly, I haven't checked all of them) From my own experience too, I've never decided to use the FreeMarker JAR because it had that one class that would be so useful on my project. Instead, its value lies in its capabilities.\r\n\r\nI'll keep this PR open (I'll adjust the version number) and will start packaging and distributing my fork in the meantime, as this will unlock a smoother upgrade to Spring 6 for many projects.\r\nI'll continue keeping my fork up to date and will be opening PRs for you as new changes are done on my side. (a wider adoption of Java 5 generics and replacement of a lot of code by standard Apache Commons libraries will be next on my to do list) Java 9 modules will also be a good way to enforce what can be used and extended outside of FreeMarker, this should greatly help with BC of selected parts of the project.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add a big thank you for your great work on this project. As mentioned, I've been using it for many years and always thought it was awesome, so please see the above as constructive feedback rather than criticism. I really value all the hard work that has gone into FreeMarker.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1626962891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1627052476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/94#issuecomment-1627052476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/94","id":1627052476,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAn9g0s5g-tm8","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-08T10:12:19Z","updated_at":"2023-07-08T10:14:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FreeMarker always supported multiple version of Java, and multiple version of the same library (especially multiple version of the servlet API) in the same single jar. So you can add Jakarta support without removing anything, and breaking anything. Gradle doesn't change any of that (though with Gradle FM 2 is at least modularized on source code level). The only reason FreeMarker 2 is not modularized on the artifact level (unlike 3) is backward compatibility, and that Maven dependency management is to simplistic to handle such a change.\r\n\r\nBC is a huge pain, yes. But users just add it as a single simple dependency, write templates, and don't care why it's working behind the scenes, and I want allow fearless updates. But, most BC pain actually comes from issues in the template language itself, which can't be fixed without heavily breaking backward compatibility with existing templates. That's what 3 is really about (would be, if I invest the time...), although along the way it also fixes lot of historical mistakes in the API. (And 3 lives in different packages, it's not a problem if some dependency of your project uses 2, and some other uses 3.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's up with Spring 6 support. Is Spring MVC FreeMarker support depend on Servlet API? Because JSP 2 \"Model 2\" is really old school at this point. (Besides, FreeMarker support was always a second class check box feature in Spring. First because the official choice was JSP, and then because of Thymeleaf. The only way to have proper Spring support would be to put the resources on that on the FreeMarker side.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1627052476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1627195405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/94#issuecomment-1627195405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/94","id":1627195405,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAn9g0s5g_QgN","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-08T12:11:07Z","updated_at":"2023-07-08T12:11:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually... the other pending PR-s will enter merge conflict status if I merge the Gradle PR...

But since we are Apache, you'd get plenty of help from other foundation members, committers etc. We already have an Apache-based project setup which adds the benefit of streamlined releases, reproducible releases etc.\r\nIf you want to do the same work again, I won't stop you. But that means I cannot contribute, as my knowledge of Gradle is very limited. And that might be true for a lot of other Apache committers.\r\n\r\nAs for the backward compatibility: \r\nBreaking changes is what major releases are for.

Added to the fact that projects still relying on `javax` were preventing us from modernising our own, especially if `jakarta` support was very low in their priorities, we have therefore replaced FreeMarker by Thymeleaf in all projects in our organisation, bar one (but that's in progress), and have made private any public repositories based on FreeMarker, to encourage the community to switch to more modern libraries instead.

Whenever you build something with gradle or maven which uses \"requires module-name-from-file-name\", it gives a BIG warning not to push something like this into the wild. Thus, no-one could have used it. The moment someone renames the `freemarker.jar` locally, it would break.  Hence, having set the module-name to something else would not had hurt back then.\r\n\r\n> (Also that happens to be the top-level Java package name.)\r\n\r\nSee issue. for JPMS, it is even more strongly encouraged to use a reverse domain name.\r\n\r\nSo then I will rebase this to the 3-branch.

The general consensus is:\r\n\r\n1. derived module name derived from file name is unstable. Gradle users might not  get the same result, so this is not a reason to name the module \"freemarker\"\r\n2. package is not linked.\r\n3. The software name is \"Apache Freemarker\", this should be reflected in modules and packages if possible.\r\nIt is not for the package, so do it for the module.\r\n4.

We can accelerate accessing elements sequentially, by index, with keeping the current data structure. The current data structure is (assuming I remember correctly) such that the concatenation result is a TemplateSequenceModel, which is a the root node of an unbalanced binary tree, where each nodes itself is TempalteSequenceModel that stores a left- and right-sequence (and with this PR now also their sizes). We could maintain a cursor in the root node. This cursor stores the path in the tree, from its root, to the last element that we had to retrieved. The path is just a List of elements, where each element stores a reference to a tree node, and the left-most index of the sequence slice the node represents in the whole (root node) sequence.  When a new element is get by index, we can navigate to it starting out from that cursor, and not from the root node. The cursor initally points to the root node. Then, accessing seq[0] is O(N) for the first time, but O(1) next time, as the cursor (the last element of the path) already points that element. Furthermore, accessing the next element (seq[1]) will also be O(1), since if the next index is out of the range for the current node, you just have to step back in the path (hence naviating to the parent node), and then down to the right node.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1793876693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1793883275","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/98#issuecomment-1793883275","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/98","id":1793883275,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAn9g0s5q7HyL","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-05T23:36:25Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T23:37:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So auto modules export everything, and we should be fine. That's good to know.\r\n\r\nI'm not seeing the relevance of the fact the module name derived from jar name is unstable. That's why it was cemented into the META-INF in some already released version(s). If someone used FreeMarker as an auto-module before that, they probably just referred to it as \"freemarker\", because that was its derived name. Most users couldn't care less about the module name, as far as it always remains the same, and, that's what was done.\r\n\r\nYes, I know how it should be, and certainly was well aware when the decision was made back then.
