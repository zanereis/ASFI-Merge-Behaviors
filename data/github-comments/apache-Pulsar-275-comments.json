@harissecic\r\n> \r\n> I didn't use Azure App Service before. But Pulsar client periodically sends heartbeats to brokers to detect if a connection is broken or not. Then it will automatically reconnect if it detects connections are broken.\r\n> \r\n> See http://pulsar.apache.org/api/client/2.7.0-SNAPSHOT/org/apache/pulsar/client/api/ClientBuilder.html#keepAliveInterval-int-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-\r\n\r\nThis was not the case in my services. However it could have been that the App Service didn't have configuration called Always ON enabled. In this case maybe there's no way that heartbeat would work, yet service would work if one would to make a HTTP request like GET on REST service. Now I don't fully understand what's happening in them but I will try to debug this with Always ON enabled and disabled. check the behaviour. I'm guessing it's most likely that the Always ON was by disabled and in such case I expect it not to work as Azure will shutdown service if there's no trafick going through. However this again raises the question shouldn't heartbeat from Pulsar keep this service running regardless of that feature because Pulsar would be the one sending network traffic? It will take a bit more time for me to make a test environment with Pulsar and a Java client to test this out and report back. I can assume also that it might be Azure killing off those connections for some reason like: not having web port active will shut down app regardless of other connections. Whatever it may be this is 99.9% on Azure side and a workaround would be helpful or it may be that the App Service should be avoided.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/743028197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/743051126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/4654#issuecomment-743051126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/4654","id":743051126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzA1MTEyNg==","user":{"login":"VanderChen","id":12984057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12984057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen","html_url":"https://github.com/VanderChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VanderChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T08:27:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T08:27:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have the same problem in WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 with OpenJDK 11 in branch-2.7","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/743051126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/743051634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8607#issuecomment-743051634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8607","id":743051634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzA1MTYzNA==","user":{"login":"wolfstudy","id":20965307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20965307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfstudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T08:28:59Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T08:28:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"After communicating with @xuesongxs , we found that we have started nearly 2000 function instances, so there is no way to return the required metrics information within the default prometheus timeout period.

Looks good, however I think you also should include the `Views` class in you implementation as I suggested.\r\n\r\nThe code, as it is now, will always serialize `ClientConfigurationData` with '****' for the secret field. Using the Views class and using the internal view explicitly in `ConfigurationDataUtils.loadData` allows us to serialize `ClientConfigurationData` with secrets for internal use. The case to cater for here is that 1) you set auth params programmatically, and then you load a config without auth params.\r\n\r\nConsider your test with the following modification:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testLoadSecretParams2() {\r\n        ClientConfigurationData confData = new ClientConfigurationData();\r\n        Map<String, String> authParamMap = new HashMap<>();\r\n        authParamMap.put(\"k1\", \"v1\");\r\n\r\n        confData.setServiceUrl(\"pulsar://unknown:6650\");\r\n        confData.setAuthParams(\"\");\r\n        confData.setAuthParamMap(authParamMap);\r\n\r\n        authParamMap.put(\"k2\", \"v2\");\r\n\r\n        Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();\r\n        config.put(\"serviceUrl\", \"pulsar://localhost:6650\");\r\n        config.put(\"authParams\", \"testAuthParams\");\r\n        // MODIFICATION: auth param map set on ClientConfigurationData but not on config override map\r\n        //config.put(\"authParamMap\", authParamMap);\r\n\r\n        confData = ConfigurationDataUtils.loadData(config, confData, ClientConfigurationData.class);\r\n        assertEquals(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\", confData.getServiceUrl());\r\n        assertEquals(\"testAuthParams\", confData.getAuthParams());\r\n        assertEquals(\"v1\", confData.getAuthParamMap().get(\"k1\"));\r\n        assertEquals(\"v2\", confData.getAuthParamMap().get(\"k2\"));\r\n\r\n        final String secretStr = \"*****\";\r\n        try {\r\n            String confDataJson = new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(confData);\r\n            Map<String, Object> confDataMap = new ObjectMapper().readValue(confDataJson, Map.class);\r\n            assertEquals(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\", confDataMap.get(\"serviceUrl\"));\r\n            assertEquals(secretStr, confDataMap.get(\"authParams\"));\r\n            assertEquals(secretStr, confDataMap.get(\"authParamMap\"));\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            Assert.fail();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the test fails with\r\n`Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Cannot construct instance of `java.util.LinkedHashMap` (although at least one Creator exists): no String-argument constructor/factory method to deserialize from String value ('*****')\r\n`\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/743767701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/743777776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8937#issuecomment-743777776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8937","id":743777776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0Mzc3Nzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"reswqa","id":19502505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTAyNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19502505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa","html_url":"https://github.com/reswqa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-12T16:09:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T16:09:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Jennifer88huang
