thank you for considering the suggestions and for the separation of the classloader. That indeed looks better readable.\r\n\r\nFor the modifications to the CI/CD script, I'd like to try to explain what happens there:\r\n\r\nWe have several tests, that are run only if certain labels are set on the corresponding PR. The idea here is, that github and Apache can't provide infitite processing power and we need to use it were it counts. Two big blocks are PHP and full java tests. Both run in the range of an hour and should not be run on all PRs, just PRs with the label `PHP` or `Java`.\r\n\r\nWe had already a split of the CI/CD runs into separate parts to allow parallel execution and @mbien added protection to the execution blocks, that checks whether the label is set:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/e1b594034bdce520dbfbc720a6cd7b7b894fc756/.github/workflows/main.yml#L791-L794\r\n\r\nThis block says:\r\n\r\nThe `platform-modules-test1` job is only run if the label `Platform` or `ci:all-tests` is set. Additionally this will be run on non-PR events, for example the merge to master (the last part of the if).\r\n\r\nYes you see rust in the full CI/CD configuration, as the first steps for rust support were added by @vieiro, but are only build by the `full` cluster configuration, not by the `release` config. The line you referenced declares a variable `test_rust`, nothing more, apart from that it is identical to the guard shown above for `Platform`.\r\n\r\nI hope the clears the idea a bit.\r\n\r\nI just saw your comment over in my \"test\" PR:\r\n\r\n> Is it wise to run the job only when a special label is added? We wouldn't catch https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5748 so quickly without running this job.\r\n\r\nI'm in a yes/no situation. I agree, that the nbjavac run was helpful to catch this. On the other hand I can understand @mbien concerns regarding false positive failures from the nbjavac run. A valid middle ground may be, to change this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/3027e4274aaa0e8a40c1ab700db67b954d76784c/.github/workflows/main.yml#L162\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'nb-javac') || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'ci:all-tests') || github.event_name != 'pull_request' }} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a compromise for both sides: On the one hand the nbjavac job will only be run on specially labeled PRs (`nb-javac` or `ci:all-tests`). On the other hand it will be run on merges to `master` (at least that is my understanding). So normal PRs will not yield more runtime, yet if the unlikely (it happend twice now) case happens, that an API is used which does not match the declared JDK, it can still be caught. The price is IMHO ok, my notebook needs 9 minutes for the NetBeans build and 3 minutes for the commit-validation run, on server class hardware I assume less.\r\n\r\n@mbien @neilcsmith-net @jtulach what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1492853749/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1492876414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5609#issuecomment-1492876414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5609","id":1492876414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5Y-3x-","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-01T08:21:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-01T08:21:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing agreed to running with same logic as most other labels for now (`nb-javac` or `ci:all-tests` labelled PRs, plus non-PR runs).

Redrawing all the icons?\r\n\r\nWell, yes, that is obviously the ideal!  There is a limit to what can be done after the fact, or automated.  Other options are to look for the most problematic icons and provide dark alternatives - I don't think the majority of the icons _are_ actually a problem.   Your before screenshot looks fine to me.  _If_ we really want an image filter, other options could be explored, such as filtering using colour distance from background colour, or a lookup table to an alternative palette (although that might involve some posterization).\r\n\r\nThe key thing is that value inversion looks alien - great if that's the intended effect - it's not possible to ignore colour theory and perception in how people interpret these things though.\r\n\r\n> The style for the new SVG icons (written up at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-2617 ) avoids the problem of inverted depth, by getting rid of the shadow/highlight detail that were present in the old bitmap icons.\r\n\r\nThis is part of it.  Ideally we'd make sure the palette is based on an alterable stylesheet, so that the colours can be corrected when first converted from SVG to a bitmap rather than assuming we can reliably do this at a later stage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1493279417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1493291080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5759#issuecomment-1493291080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5759","id":1493291080,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ZAdBI","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-02T10:26:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-02T10:26:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mbien I also tried to fix that file at first.

Adding options for everything is not my first choice, there is a budget for that too. But UI topics specifically have the tendency to be very user specific. I still see users having nimbus LAF enabled from time to time for example (which is to my eyes super ugly and also somewhat broken in NB). And we clearly have a situation here of some liking the new icons and caring less about consistency (or rising valid points of not flip flopping between two states from release to release), and others caring more about consistency and/or maybe not liking the new icons. This maps beautifully to a checkbox. We can make both camps happy - that is all I am trying to say :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1493371893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1493372255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5756#issuecomment-1493372255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5756","id":1493372255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5ZAw1f","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-02T15:27:39Z","updated_at":"2023-04-02T15:27:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the review.\r\n\r\n> do you think we should wrap the html lexer test into the retry script?
