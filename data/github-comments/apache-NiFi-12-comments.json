The com.bazaar.jolt... dependency does not appear to be accounted for in the LICENSE/NOTICE updates.  Their LICENSE does indicate they would like reference made to 'Copyright 2013-2014 Bazaarvoice, Inc.'  This is found in https://github.com/bazaarvoice/jolt/blob/1271e1919693e63ce1efdf534dfee0e0579d0b2f/LICENSE  So we should propogate that into the NOTICE file as well.  Also we need to reference JOLT in our top level nifi-assembly/NOTICE as well if it is new and I'd assume at least for Bazaar it would be.\n2. I don't believe I follow the recommendation to change the member variable 'transform' to volatile or to set it to null on stopped.  The variable appears to be set at the proper lifecycle point in NiFi and thus would not be reassigned in some non-thread safe way.  The only question then is could its use itself be non Thread safe and that does appear questionable to me.  In that case marking the variable as volatile won't help at all anyway.  If indeed it is not thread safe you will want to consider marking the class as executing serially or you could have a pool of transforms or you could transform batches at a time.  Lots of ways to tackle it.  Of course if that is thread safe already then you are fine and in any event the volatile should be unnecessary.  Finally, I am not aware of any cause for setting it to null during onStopped or on unScheduled as if the processor was being removed from the flow then it would get cleaned up anyway.  If there was a need to call a close method or something then yes that is good.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211708711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211711025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/238#issuecomment-211711025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/238","id":211711025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTcxMTAyNQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T03:26:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T03:26:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Anyone in a good position to test/validate this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211711025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211711720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/239#issuecomment-211711720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/239","id":211711720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTcxMTcyMA==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T03:28:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T03:28:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello @mans2singh .

It seems like a reasonable easy-path option for folks just wanting to use some simple/local username and password based setup.

We should strive to move away from config file based options and move fully towards service/REST API driven approaches.  These will serve us better in clustered/cloud type environments as well.\n\nAre we open to including a sample credentials file? Where would you recommend it go?\n- Absolutely.  In conf directory like the others of its type.  I think an argument could be made to have this username/password driven mode be the default.\n\nAre we open to documenting this identity provider on the front-page of the Admin Guide alongside X.509 and LDAP? Where else should I do so?\n- We must do so.  We should fully embrace this as an option and document what it is good for and not good for.  Our current default of having no authentication at all is what we should be working to eliminate.  I think this offers us a good first step to do that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211716593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/211718256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/354#issuecomment-211718256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/354","id":211718256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTcxODI1Ng==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T03:56:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T03:56:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt As I am thinking more about it, you have a point for @OnStopped, so I am retracting my comment.

I have some suggestions.\n1.  I would change the PR to support all the built-in transformations including 'sort' and 'cardinality' which are not in the pull request.  \n2. 90% of what we've seen uses ChainR as that is a composition of 1 or more individual transforms, almost always a \"ShiftR + DefaultR\".  In fact it is a little confusing to support options other than just \"Chainr\" since ChainR takes an array of individual transform Specs whereas the others are individual specs.

Here is my test case:\nGenerateFlowFile -> ReplaceText -> PublishKafka\nConsuleKafka -> UpdateAttribute -> PutFile\nThe update attribute processor is to change the filename with uuid to ensure a file is correctly created for each message consumed.\n\nI start all my processors, and after a short moment I only stop the GenerateFlowFile. What I observe is a number X of messages published (confirmed by checking Kafka topic) and a lower number Y of messages consumed. However, the last message published is consumed (I checked the created file). So it seems that some messages are simply skipped.\n\nThen I started only the publish part to have 16 messages published. Stopped the publish part and started the consuming part. I consumed only one message and the number of tasks on ConsumeKafka processor is continually growing (I stopped everything when having 200+ tasks indicated on the processor).\n\nWent in debug, and:\n\n``` java\nConsumerRecords<byte[], byte[]> consumedRecords = this.kafkaResource.poll(100);\n```\n\nis empty.\n\nBesides:\n\n``` java\nboolean reset = this.taskCounter.decrementAndGet() == 0 && !this.acceptTask;\n```\n\nreturns false because **this.acceptTask = true**.\n\nI think it explains the growing number of tasks.

Will try to figure out why this happens.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/213764931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/213767740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/366#issuecomment-213767740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/366","id":213767740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzc2Nzc0MA==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-23T15:48:20Z","updated_at":"2016-04-23T15:48:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually @pvillard31 this is yet another great observation as @joewitt and I have seen something similar during the intermittent failures of `PublishKafkaTest.validateDemarcationIntoEmptyMessages` (missing messages).
