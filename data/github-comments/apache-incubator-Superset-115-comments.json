use `AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_REMOTE_USER` for authentication, and [set REMOTE_USER](https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet/blob/production/modules/superset/templates/superset.wikimedia.org.erb#L21-L34) to the authenticated LDAP user's shell username via Apache mod_ldap in front of superset.  I'd like for folks that authenticate this way to be able to run hive queries as their own user.\r\n\r\n2 questions:\r\n\r\n- Why check `'auth' in url.query.keys()` when deciding whether or not to set this.  If `impersonate_user and username is not None`, shouldn't that be enough?  I have to configure my Hive database connection with `?auth=NONE` to get this to work. (To do so I also annoyingly have to specify a database in the URI, as `hostname:10000?auth=NONE` seems to try and parse the full `10000?auth=NONE` as the integer port for the URI.)\r\n\r\n- When I do set `?auth=NONE` in the URI, testing the database connection seems fine.  But, saving the database connection fails with: `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'hive_server2_proxy_user'`, and fails to save the change.  Upon saving, I see `INFO:root:Database.get_sqla_engine(). Masked URL: hive://hostname:10000/default?auth=NONE&hive_server2_proxy_user=otto` in the superset logs, which I think looks mostly good, buuuut, where are those underscores coming from?

It'd be somewhat possible to implement this. One little challenge is that your pie chart may be a set of metrics with no dimension (filters shouldn't work), or one dimension and one metric (should work here). That'd be pretty easy to do as the dashboard controller already supports filtering (but only Table and Filter Box viz implement it)\r\n2. Isn't this exactly what the Filter Box does?\r\n3. There's a checkbox on the Table viz to add a full-text search\r\n4. Word cloud could be altered to cast filtering event (much like Table does)\r\n5.

I am actually using one dimension one metric in pie chart, How can I make controller perform this type of filtering.\r\n2. Actually when we add filter box, we define some filterable column (like: gender). I am having more than 10 filterable columns, I don't want to add 10 filter slices, I want a generic filter where first I choose which column I want and then it automatically adds one filter using that column.\r\n3.
