Cloud-init will get the passwd from the server it got the ip address from (on the direct ip, not the vip) so it is not needed.\n\nIt's a nice idea to have \"redundancy\" here but it will lead to unexpected problems. Imagine a VM starting and getting the passwd from the master, which marks it as sent. Then the VM restarts and a failover had taken place. Now it gets the same password from the new master (old backup, which has not been marked as retrieved). If a user had changed the password manually, it is now being reset to the previous one. We had this going in in production for a while and it confuses users a lot.

in such cases you can fetch the branch of the submitter in your own workspace and build on top of it, push to your own fork on github and open a PR from that. When that gets merged the older one automatically get marked as merged as well. very convenient way of building on each others

The question regarding the “com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XenServerConnectionPool.TrustAllManager\" class was the following. \n\n> The code at line 77-96 is setting the default SSL socket factory for HTTPS connection to an implementation (TrustAllManager class created at lines 483- 506) that always considers the certificate of the server valid (without any checks). Also, at line 90, it was overridden the host name verifier (the check that matches hostname and certificates CN) to always returns true. \n\nWe also mentioned that:\n\n> We might be misinterpreting the java doc of methods “javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(SSLSocketFactory)” and “javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(HostnameVerifier)”, but those sets seem to affect every single HTTPS request that is performed by ACS (JVM runtime in which those methods were executed). We do not know how many HTTPS requests, and to what extent they are essential to ACS workings, but that code seems to make ACS vulnerable to man in the middle attacks (if it uses HTTPS requests to execute some of its tasks).\n\nSpeculating a bit, we had an idea why that code was added:\n\n> We believe that was done in order to allow the use of the XAPI via rest API through HTTPS, probably because the host is using self-signed certificates. If that is the case, I think we have better options to work around that, such as just disabling the check for those specific requests and or using a keystore with the hosts’ public keys that could be downloaded at the host addition process.\n\nIn conclusion, if ACS uses an HTTPS connection to either download a file (template or something else) or to send a command to a remote region over the internet that connection/request may be vulnerable to MID attacks. Even though we will have an SSL connection, we will not know with whom, because the certificate checks were all disabled.\n\nAgain I would like to say that we do not know how many (if) ACS uses much HTTPS request to execute some of its tasks; that is why we raised the question.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/223022204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/223081376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1575#issuecomment-223081376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1575","id":223081376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzA4MTM3Ng==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T18:23:00Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T18:23:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think that is correct @swill, this is mainly a code cleanup.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/223081376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/223158433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/868#issuecomment-223158433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/868","id":223158433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzE1ODQzMw==","user":{"login":"bvbharatk","id":2075740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzU3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2075740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk","html_url":"https://github.com/bvbharatk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvbharatk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T23:49:43Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T23:49:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### ACS CI BVT Run\n\n **Sumarry:**\n Build Number 108\n Hypervisor xenserver\n NetworkType Advanced\n Passed=72\n Failed=1\n Skipped=3\n\n_Link to logs Folder (search by build_no):_ https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yj3wnzbceo9uef2/AAB6u-Iap-xztdm6jHX9SjPja?dl=0\n\n**Failed tests:**\n- test_vm_life_cycle.py\n  -
