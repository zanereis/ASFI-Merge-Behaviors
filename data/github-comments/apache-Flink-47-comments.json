However, relying on that is super dangerous. As soon as you hit a case where that is not given, it will not work any more.\n\nNot being able to find a counter example does not mean it is correct. \n\nThe network stack works, because it ships metadata bytes per element. With the TypeSerializerInput/Output format example, the output writes for 10 elements an empty file, the input reads either none or infinitely many. There is at least one counterexample.\n\nWhat is so bad about creating a `Tuple0Serializer` that writes a dummy byte per tuple?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127949704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127951144","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/983#issuecomment-127951144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/983","id":127951144,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzk1MTE0NA==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T10:32:53Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T10:32:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There is nothing bad about it.

Yes, when the parallelism differs it throws an exception now. Previously, when a user did not specify a partition strategy, forward was assumed. This was valid for a change of parallelism, which led to either the degenerative case of only one downstream instance receiving elements (1 to n parallelism) or one or several downstream instances receiving skewed numbers of instances (m to n, where m > n). \n\nI think we can document forward as the default for n -> n parallelism and rebalance as default for n -> m parallelism and change the behavior.\n\nAbout the dangling operators, also true.

current state with the `RichMapPartitionFunctions` looks good to me :+1: \n\nYou're right that user usually want to fix the size for the whole sample. An easy solution could be to assign each item an index, see `DataSetUtils.zipWithIndex`. Then we can compute the maximum index (which is effectively counting the data set elements). This gives us the range from which have to sample. By generating a parallel sequence of the size of our sample size with `env.generateSequence(maxIndex)`, we could then sample from `[0, maxIndex]`. At last we would have to join this data set with the original data set which has the indices assigned. There are probably more efficient algorithms out there than this one.\n\nJust ping me when you've found a solution for the problem.

The idea is to divide the data into blocks and find the probability of selection of an element from a block.\nThus, suppose there are blocks B_1, B_2, ..., B_N with probabilities P_1, P_2, ..., P_N, then you sample k points by first sampling from the distribution {P_1, P_2, ..., P_N} and find the number of elements you require from each block. After that you select the required number of points from each block and take a union.\nIt is pretty easy to implement in a shared memory system but with a distributed system, it is hard. I tried the following approach some time before, although didn't quite finish working on it:\nblockedData = Data -> (block_id, data)\n\nblockNumbers = (block_id, data) -> (block_id, count)\n\n(1...k) -> (list of block ids we'll be sampling from)\nAfter this, I tried broadcasting the list and selecting the required number of elements from each block, which can be done quite easily.

@sachingoel0101,\nI am not sure if I would like to add this, because it is quite dangerous. Does your proposal of a Parameter Server rely on this PR?\n\nThere is certainly a big need for a parameter server interface! It would be really cool to have an interface that allows to plugin different servers. A related discussion is happening on PR #906. It would be good if we could consolidate the efforts and come up with an interface that serves all needs and maybe one (light-weight) parameter server implementation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129171702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129174100","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1000#issuecomment-129174100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1000","id":129174100,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTE3NDEwMA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-09T12:17:48Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T12:17:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Congrats @vasia for the 1000th PR! :fireworks: :tada: :fireworks: \n\n:smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129174100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/129175273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1000#issuecomment-129175273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1000","id":129175273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTE3NTI3Mw==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-09T12:33:45Z","updated_at":"2015-08-09T12:33:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ha!
