I should note that you can save query results as a CSV, which can be opened in Excel.

I'm not very familiar with how copy-pasting formatted data works, but I would think using proper HTML `<table>` tags would do the trick.\r\n\r\nChanging to `<table>` is a bit tricky though, as we're using [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) to render the table for performance. It looks like the `Grid` component is being used for this. There's a `Table` component, but that appears to render to `<div>`s as well.

Typescript is merely a superset of javascript, thus all javascript is valid typescript, the same cannot be said about elm or reason. Reason and elm are compiled languages with compiler checks and the code that's run in the browser can be quite different than the code written by the developer. From a strictly type safety perspective, you are correct those 2 languages provide much greater safety than typescript. However, introducing these technologies would mean a significantly change in the developer experience and workflow. At this point it's not reasonable to propose porting the existing codebase to reason or elm, nor does it seem reasonable to support 2 distinct developer experiences for the same code. \r\n\r\n>Well, both Reason and Elm are used by much larger amounts of people, so that argument does not apply to them.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is accurate, the number of developers writing typescript exceeds the number of developers writing reason and elm by orders of magnitude.
