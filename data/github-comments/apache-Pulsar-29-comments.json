My question was more of how does it work now with v1 global namespaces?\r\n\r\nWhile assigning namespace bundle ownership, LoadManager considers two things: (1) get list of failure-domains (where each domain will have list of brokers) (2) for a requested bundle, get group of anti affinity namespaces (from namespace policies). Then load manager tries to select broker from failure domains so, this anti-affinity namespaces get distributed uniformly across these failure domains.\r\n\r\nwith V2, namespace policies will not be changed so, 2nd part will not be affected. however, we store failure domain in global zk under `/admin/clusters`. therefore, we can change this place-holder and store it in local zk so, each cluster
