You can always check in which superstep you are using getIterationRuntimeContext().getCurrentSuperstep()\n\nWe initialize the caches at the first superstep by checking if the reference is null, as the assumption is that since the same instantiated task is reused through the iterations, the cache is initialized only in the first superstep and the reference is not null in the subsequent supersteps.

By allowing parallel tasks to exchange data, these tasks are no longer independent. In fact the system relies on these assumptions at several places including fault tolerance & recovery. Even if in your use case, exact recovery might not be important, other users might use this feature in a different way.\n\nChanges that have the potential to change the behavior of the system like this PR need to be discussed in detail by the Flink community.

Also, these methods can be implemented in less than a minute. I think @StephanEwen has a point that all Input/OutputFormats are always quite rich.

In fact, I didn't manage to break the system.\n\nThe reason why we argued that Tuple0 is unsafe is because de/serialization does not read/write anything and the byte stream is not forwarded. Hence you could \"read\" a million Tuple0 objects without advancing the stream. This is only relevant for DataSet that consist completely of types that have this behavior, because as soon there is another type with proper de/serialization the stream is advanced. \n\nI was surprised when @mjsax said, that a job that shuffled Tuple0 records (which means de/serialization) worked. I verified that and my guess would be that the network stack writes the number of records into its network buffer and stops deserializing after all records are deserialized (not when the byte stream is EOF). Hence, network serialization works even if no bytes are shipped. @uce or @StephanEwen might confirm this.\n\nAnother reason to de/serialize data is for sorting, grouping, joining, or crossing. Most transformation that require a key (there are some inconsistency wrt to key handling in the API) do not allow Tuple0 keys and fail with a good error message when the program is constructed (not at runtime). The API does not allow to sort, join, or group a data set on a Tuple0. I thought that using a cross transformation would let a program fail while executing because it does not require a key and should serialize data, however it worked. \n\nThe system seems to be more robust than I expected. Nonetheless, I am still a bit skeptical about this change and would like to learn why network transfer and crossing worked so well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127764809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127770092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/907#issuecomment-127770092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/907","id":127770092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzc3MDA5Mg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T21:38:16Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T21:38:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127770092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/127782760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/907#issuecomment-127782760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/907","id":127782760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzc4Mjc2MA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T22:44:37Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T22:44:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the excellent work!
