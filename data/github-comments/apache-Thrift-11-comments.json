Sorry if I'm misunderstanding you, but I don't think I explained myself very well with\n\n> This doesn't really make sense on the server side since if you implement a service you end up leaving all the async method unimplemented.\n\nHere's an example scenario just so it's clear what I'm talking about:\n\nSay I have two servers, Server 1 and Server 2. I also have two thrift services, Thrift Service A and Thrift Service B. Server 1 implements Thrift Service A, and calls Thrift Service B on Server 2. Server 2 implements Thrift Service B. So something like this:\n\n| Server 1 | Server 2 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Implements Thrift Service A | Implements Thrift Service B |\n| Calls Thrift Service B |  |\n\nHere's example thrift definitions:\n\n```\nservice ThriftServiceA\n{\n    void Method1();\n}\n\nservice ThriftServiceB\n{\n    string GetSomeInformation();\n}\n```\n\nI then generate the code using the thrift compiler, and use the async:true option. Because of the way we generate the code for our solutions, this causes the async interfaces to be generated for both Thrift Service A, and Thrift Service B.\n\nOn Server 1, I then have some kind of API call that calls Thrift Service B:\n\n``` csharp\n[Route(\"api/Information\")]\npublic async Task<string> GetSomeInformation()\n{\n    return await _thriftServiceB.GetSomeInformationAsync();\n}\n```\n\nThis makes perfect sense because I'm making an async call to a thrift service via the thrift client.\n\nI then go to implement Thrift Service A, and what I end up with is something like:\n\n``` csharp\npublic class ThriftServiceAImpl : ThriftServiceA.Iface\n{\n    public void Method1()\n    {\n        // Do something\n    }\n\n    public Task Method1Async()\n    {\n        throw new NotImplementedException(\"There's no point implementing this\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo in the example above, there's no point implementing Method1Async, because the current HttpHandler implementation doesn't ever call it - it only calls the synchronous implementation. So it's just noise, but you have to implement it because it's part of the interface.\n\nSo my patch doesn't actually change the method names at all, it just splits the two sets of methods into two separate interfaces so that if you're only implementing the synchronous set you only need to implement the synchronous methods, and the same for the async ones.\n\nNow that I think about it, I think my change is actually backwards compatible, because Iface implements ISync and IAsync, so there's probably no need for a separate compiler flag. I was just playing it safe. I'll leave that decision up to you guys though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/170243463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/170244552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/762#issuecomment-170244552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/762","id":170244552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDI0NDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"adam-resdiary","id":4849264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDkyNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4849264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary","html_url":"https://github.com/adam-resdiary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adam-resdiary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-09T14:48:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-09T14:48:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Jens-G \n\n> The project files are 2013 now.

It was missing semicolons in the default init methods where a collection type had a default value.\n\nI believe this semicolon problem is due to discrepancies in how the caller of this method assumes code will be generated--with semicolons and line breaks or not. I think if the call sites were to be cleaned up the ugliness would go away. I believe I checked them but I might've overlooked them. I'll give it another look again later too.\n\nThe NSSet change should've been in another PR, I admit, but it was for performance reasons (since one of Thrift's main goals is performance). I believe that optimized ARC code cannot cancel out the autorelease that setWithArray makes because Foundation isn't using ARC itself (I think, but it's worth testing.) Even if it could I think it's still faster to not have to have it back out of autoreleasing. I considered changing it to the initWithObjects variant but it seemed a little too drastic and needs performance testing.

It requires users which derive from TTransport to be more strict when they implement their own version of isOpen() and getOrigin() as it enforces them to not alter the internal state of their custom TTransport implementation when we are calling one of those methods from the Thrift C++ library. So from the Thrift library point of view, we can refactor the C++ library and call isOpen() more or less often without introducing side effects in the users code. peek() should be also const in my opinion, as it should return true in case data is available for reading.\n\n@hcorg: I took a quick look into your fork on github (cpp_v2). I really like the way how you refactored the c++ code generator. How can I get involved in the refactoring of the cpp_v2 library / compiler?
