thanks much for the review. As far as I could tell, the only UI changes in the original PR were for the default schema. It would take a bit of effort to create a UI for a list of options. In fact, it might be better to extend the back-end to allow the user to post a series of queries in one go, with all but the last being trivial. This approach would be easier for humans because there is no need to figure out how a UI maps to a command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE foo;\r\nALTER SESSION SET `bar` = 'mumble';\r\nSELECT ... FROM something ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the REST API, it is probably easier to include these extras in the REST request. A clever client can accumulate changes and include them with each query request.\r\n\r\nThe REST API can allow additional features that the UI ignores. In the case of options, the UI won't post any and the back-end will skip the options step.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nFinally, thanks for pointing out DRILL-7655. How did that get filed if the original PR never made it into master? Anyway, I agree it should be fixed and I'll look into that for this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/612576587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/612607875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2052#issuecomment-612607875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2052","id":612607875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjYwNzg3NQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-12T12:36:53Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T12:36:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers sounds good.

this is great! I wonder, will this PR handle a particular use case that I'm seeing?\r\n\r\nThe metastore works for files. We are seeing more cases where users want to read other data sources: HTTP, Mongo, whatever. These sources deliver JSON, which can be ambiguous. We want to use a provided schema to resolve ambiguities. (That work is ongoing in updating the JSON reader, etc.) So, we need a place to store the provided schema.\r\n\r\nRecall that, for files, we put the provided schema in the same folder as the data. For the HTTP plugin, say, there is no directory to place the files.\r\n\r\nSo, can we use the DB-backed metastore? Will there be a standard way for a plugin to map its concept of a table to an entry in the metastore which can hold the provided schema?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/615394559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/615395578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2060#issuecomment-615395578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2060","id":615395578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTM5NTU3OA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-17T18:24:21Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T18:24:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, another related question.

Though none of them are addressed in this PR, since this PR only adds support for Drill Metastore `tables` component. I will provide below extended answer to your questions with the guidelines on what could be done to support use cases you have asked about.\r\n\r\n`First question`:\r\nShort answer: yes but some parts should be implemented first.\r\nExtended answer:\r\nLet's assume we want to store schema for HTTP plugin tables in Drill Metastore and use it when querying data from this plugin.\r\n`ANALYZE TABLE` command collects data about table, including schema, statistics etc. It allows user to provide schema inline as well. For example: `ANALYZE TABLE table(dfs.tmp.region(schema=>'inline=(id int, country varchar)')) REFRESH METADATA`.\r\n\r\nYou can also call it only with schema and without statistics but you will need to disable statistics collection using session option: `planner.statistics.use`, in future `ANALYZE TABLE` command can be updated to do this without setting the option.\r\n\r\nNow `ANALYZE TABLE` command works only with file based tables. So first we will need to extend it to support analysis for tables from storage plugins. Maybe add interfaces that each storage plugin would need to implement. \r\n`ANALYZE TABLE` command will gather data for such tables and transfer it to the Drill Metastore. Drill Metastore will store it and will be able to provide it when asked (this part is implemented already). \r\nCurrently, only file based format plugins work with Drill Metastore, so last step would be to integrate Drill Metastore usage in HTTP plugin or any other plugin.\r\n\r\n`Second question`:\r\nShort answer: yes, but you will have to implement new components.\r\nExtended answer:\r\nDrill Metastore consists of megastore-api (which contains Metastore interfaces and general classes) and metastore implementations, now we have Iceberg, this PR adds also RDBMS.\r\nDrill Metastore interface consists of components. Now we have only `tables` component which stores metadata for Drill tables, including their segments, files, row groups and partitions if any. `Views` component is present but not implemented. https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/master/metastore/metastore-api/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/metastore/Metastore.java\r\n\r\nSo what if you want to add new component, for example, `pstore`? Just add new component to the `DrillMetastore` interface. As you wrote, it would store \r\ninformation `for plugins, UDFs, security credentials and more` so I think it's better to create separate component to each information type:\r\n```\r\nPlugins plugins();\r\nUdfs udfs();\r\nCredentials credentials();\r\n```\r\nFor each component you would also need to come up with some `unit` which will be used to provide info to the Metastore and back. For example, for `tables` component there is `TableMetadataUnit` unit.\r\nThen you would need to implement these interfaces in Drill Iceberg and RDBMS Metastore implementations. In Iceberg each component would have it's own Iceberg table, in RDBMS - one or several database tables. Most of the code is already written, you would just need to add code specific for each new component.\r\nAnd last step is to integrate Metastore calls in Drill code where you will need to use it. `DrillMetastore` is accessible though `DrillbitContext`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/615879117/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/615934230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2054#issuecomment-615934230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2054","id":615934230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTkzNDIzMA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-18T19:44:58Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T02:37:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, yes, we can modify the queries to force the incorrect behavior. We could add a yet another option to turn off inheritance and keep the old behavior. However, I'd argue that the old results were actually wrong, and the new results are correct. So, if we modify anything, it seems the best approach is to modify the expected results to reflect the correct behavior, and let the old versions fail because they were, in fact, wrong.\r\n\r\nActually, it is possible to modify the query to produce the correct results on old versions: we just specify values for the fields which are inherited in Drill 1.18. Doing so will mask the old, incorrect, behavior, and won't test the new behavior.\r\n\r\nYet another option is to modify the framework. In addition to the `.q`, and `.e` files, add a `.p` (parameters) file and the supporting code. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalidTo: \"1.17\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the old queries, and:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalidFrom: \"1.18\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the new queries. Better would be to use commit IDs, but those are not ordered.\r\n\r\nWe used to have this problem all the time back when Drill was taking shape.

The next time you do a run, just keep an eye out that those four tests now pass. No need to do a run just for this fix.\r\n\r\nLooking at the test framework code, I can almost offer you another option. The framework has a `before-run.sql` script which will issue `ALTER SESSION` commands. We can add an option to disable table function inheritance so the test run as-is.\r\n\r\nOf course, we probably check if the option is valid. If I add a new option, it won't be valid for older Drill versions and so test startup would fail. So, we'd need something to trigger whether to set the option, or some way to catch and ignore errors for older versions.

Yes, there should be handling of the corner cases you mentioned. If there are two jars with the same code (different versions), they will get loaded as different plugins. That is one advantage of class loader isolation (which is still to be added.) It is a user question if they want \"foo.1.2.3\" and \"foo.1.3.1\" to both be available as plugins.\r\n\r\nThe multi-Drillbit issue is for the future. This PR  just adds the base framework; nothing uses it yet.\r\n\r\nThat said, the goal of this work is to provide an easier way to create and manage plugins. Given the desire for a 1.18 release, and the lull in contributors, maybe now is not the best time for such a major change.
