I think we could improve a bit separation of concerns in the SharedBuffer. I am a bit afraid this class will become too complex once again. How about we split the SharedBuffer into two layers: caching one(SharedBuffer) and accessing buffer e.g. `SharedBufferAccessor`.  We could make the accessor `AutoCloseable`. I think it would give more explicit information about the necessity to flush the buffer.\r\n\r\nWe could move to `SharedBufferAccessor` methods like:\r\n- registerEvent\r\n- put\r\n- extractPatterns\r\n- materializeMatch\r\n- materializeMatch\r\n- lockNode\r\n- releaseNode\r\n- removeNode\r\n- lockEvent\r\n- releaseEvent\r\n\r\nIn the `SharedBuffer` we would leave only the caching package-protected methods. We would also add a method there to get the `SharedBufferAccessor` that would `flush` the changes on `close`. This way we would have a cleaner separation, plus we would make the flushing more intuitive.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/404176080/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/404180841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6301#issuecomment-404180841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6301","id":404180841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDE4MDg0MQ==","user":{"login":"jrthe42","id":5790960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTA5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5790960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42","html_url":"https://github.com/jrthe42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrthe42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-11T14:02:21Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T14:02:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
