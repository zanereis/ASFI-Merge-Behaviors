I'd like to reduce the number of Maps and Collections passed around in that code and replace with a builder, specifically the `Map<Integer, List<InstanceId>> resource` that is used, as well as some of our shared `PackingUtil` static helpers. I've looked at the code a bit and I think an impl like this would work to encapsulate building/modifying packing plans:\n\n```\npublic class PackingPlanBuilder {\n  PackingPlanBuidler()\n  PackingPlanBuidler(PackingPlan existingPacking)\n\n  // topology settings\n  void setTopologyId(String topologyId);\n\n  // set resource settings\n  void setDefaultInstanceResource(Resource resource);\n  void setRequestedComponentRam(String componentName, long ram);\n  void setRequestedContainerRam(long ram);\n  void setRequestedContainerRamPadding(long ram);\n\n  // add or remove instances\n  void addInstance(Integer containerId, InstanceId instance);\n  void removeInstance(Integer containerId, InstanceId instance);\n  void removeAnyInstance(String componentName);\n\n  // build container plan sets by summing up instance resources\n  // mostly impl from PackingUtils.buildContainerPlans\n  PackingPlan build() throws InvalidPackingExcepton;\n}\n```\n\ncc/ @avflor @ashvina who have also been thinking about this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/252380152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/252381836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1481#issuecomment-252381836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1481","id":252381836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjM4MTgzNg==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-07T23:10:29Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T23:10:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍

the current workflow for both packing algorithms is that based on number of containers, the algos basically call `addInstance` to bind `InstanceId`s to containers. Once that's complete the build process converts `InstanceId`s into `InstancePlan`s to make the `PackingPlan`. This stage requires the notion of instance and container resources and is currently handled in [PackingUtils.buildContainerPlans](https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/packing/src/java/com/twitter/heron/packing/PackingUtils.java#L93). \n\nThe only real difference between `InstanceId`s and `InstancePlan`s is that the latter has resources, so it's not clear to me how we can have a packing plan builder that takes `InstanceId`s without taking some notion of resources.
