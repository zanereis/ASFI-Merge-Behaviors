Ethos-N just directly serializes the constants into the binary module so it doesn't care if they're missing in the MetadataModule.\n\nCould we improve ACL's customized runtime so that it could know if the constant should load from MetadataModule or itself? To me, Ethos-N is just an extreme case that completely gets rid of constants in MetadataModule, but constant updater should be capable of supporting all three cases: all in MetadataModule, some in MetadataModule, and none in MetadataModule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/804670541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/804674880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7698#issuecomment-804674880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7698","id":804674880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNDY3NDg4MA==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T07:13:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T07:13:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just a guess.

Overall LGTM. Meanwhile I have some questions about the design:\r\n> \r\n>     1. It seems to me that ConcretizeLike and EliminateIdentity can also be merged to SImplifyExpr in terms of the implementation and semantic. What's the concern of having 3 separate passes?\r\n> \r\n>     2. You mentioned that for a certain reason, EliminateIdentity should be run before SimplifyExpr, but I didn't get the point about what would happen if we run them in the reverse order. Could you elaborate a bit further?\r\n\r\n1. It is definitely possible- I separated them mainly for ability to test them separately, as otherwise the overall semantics of the combined pass might be a bit tricky to write test cases for (e.g. will need to adjust the cases where we are adding 0 or multiplying by 1). I can definitely add additional test cases that run all of them in sequence (as if it was 1 single pass), or just try to merge them into SimplifyExpr and update the test cases. lmk\r\n2. Yeah, so SimplifyExpr has a rewrite called `FullElementwise` that takes (for example) `x + zeros_like(x)` and rewrites it to `x + const(0)`. I couldn't think of a portable way to rewrite `x + const(0)` to `x` in `EliminateIdentity`, so it won't reduce this expression. For this reason you should run `EliminateIdentity` first- hope this makes sense. That being said, if there is a good way to examine constant values for any dtype (e.g. casting?) then we could also eliminate this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/806004438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/806008203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7731#issuecomment-806008203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7731","id":806008203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjAwODIwMw==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T17:15:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T17:15:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If the purpose is just for testing, then I'll prefer to have them in a single pass.

Yes the problem is that different targets, and target specific topi implementations, can support different optimizations. In the case of using the blas libraries supported for a target, implicit broadcast is not supported. \r\n\r\nOne option that comes to mind is to add a shape legalization pass that adds the broadcast if a target has specific attributes (e.g. libs=cublas/rocblas etc). However this isn't sufficient; depending on the op strategy priorities or the applied tuning configs, it's possible that the blas library implementation won't be used. A better option could be to make use of #7518, and do the shape legalization after the primitive functions have been lowered to TIR and can be inspected.\r\n\r\nWe could also disable implicit broadcast, but that can increase the memory use (from folding the constant broadcasts) which we've seen overflow device memory for larger batch sizes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/806052775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/806059563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7733#issuecomment-806059563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7733","id":806059563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjA1OTU2Mw==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T18:29:18Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T18:29:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @rafzi, this change looks good to me. can you retrigger the CI by adding an empty commit? looks like it got stuck on task_rust.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/806059563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/806069140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7730#issuecomment-806069140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7730","id":806069140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNjA2OTE0MA==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T18:45:12Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T18:45:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another direction I can think of is adding the broadcast support in CuBLAS batch_matmul so that we could have a unified behavior of batch_matmul op in Relay, and we don't need to change anything else.

I agree with @tqchen an RFC would be great.\r\n\r\nlooking over the code I see a lot of concepts implemented that are fairly similar to what we have implemented in microTVM now:\r\n - a remote execution driver\r\n - a project generation script\r\n - a minimal C runtime, including graph runtime and c_backend_api.h implementation\r\n\r\nFor microTVM, we're taking the approach of reusing C runtime components between platforms and/or SoCs, and allowing platform-specific e.g. memory allocators by implementing `include/tvm/runtime/crt/platform.h`. We are also adopting a standard \"interface layer\" between TVM and generated firmware code (composed of \"Model Library Format,\" \"Project API,\" and the \"TVM RPC server\"), which provides a great way to reduce boilerplate code when targeting µC.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could consider a way to unify your approach with our microTVM approach. It seems like the STM32 firmware code could become an implementation of our Project API (similar to the [host](https://github.com/areusch/incubator-tvm/tree/project-generator/src/runtime/crt/host) demo project). This would allow us to bring further improvements to TVM currently under development (e.g. AOT runtime, graph-level optimization, `tvmc` integration), as well as enable AutoTVM on your platform.\r\n\r\n Here are some pointers to RFCs that describe our approach in more detail:\r\n - [microTVM M2 roadmap](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/tvm-microtvm-m2-roadmap/8821)\r\n - [Model Library Format RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-tvm-model-library-format/9121), now committed\r\n - [Project Generator API RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-tvm-project-api/9449), PoC [here](https://github.com/areusch/incubator-tvm/tree/project-generator).\r\n - [AOT Runtime RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/implementing-aot-in-tvm/9206)\r\n\r\nPlease also feel free to suggest improvements or changes to our current implementation. It is very much in development and we would like to encourage contributions!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/807144342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/807208480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7743#issuecomment-807208480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7743","id":807208480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNzIwODQ4MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-25T18:09:10Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T18:09:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7744 on followup analysis","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/807208480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/807215855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7741#issuecomment-807215855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7741","id":807215855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNzIxNTg1NQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-25T18:13:39Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T18:13:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @ctlinglingliu . please open a new thread on https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/ for followup Qs, you need to set target_host to be llvm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/807215855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
