version of Sharding-Sphere did you use?**\r\nanswer：<sharding-sphere.version>3.0.0</sharding-sphere.version>\r\n\r\n**Which project did you use? Sharding-JDBC or Sharding-Proxy?**\r\n Sharding-JDBC \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nInsert 4 million pieces of data into the mysql database (mysql version 5.2.65), the data is completely inserted correctly. and Execute the query.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\t\tUserInfoExample example = new UserInfoExample();\r\n\t\texample.createCriteria().andPasswordEqualTo(\"password 0\");\r\n\t\texample.setOrderByClause(\"create_time\");\r\n\t\tList<UserInfo> users = userInfoMapper.selectByExample(example);\r\n\t\t\r\n\tThe occurred above user_id duplicate problem , I confirmed that the database data is no problem. Only the results of the query appeared。\r\n\t\r\n\tThen I changed the test code：\r\n\t\tUserInfoExample example = new UserInfoExample();\r\n\t\texample.createCriteria().andUserIdBetween(279023793651843071L, 279023793651843074L);\r\n\t\texample.setOrderByClause(\"create_time\");\r\n\t\tList<UserInfo> users = userInfoMapper.selectByExample(example);\r\n\t\t\r\n\tThe problem is still，And the result that user_id=279023793651843071L is not in the query range appears. But only part of the data has this problem,\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n**Reason analyze (If you can)**\r\nI really don't understand.  Because not all of these problems occur, the same execution statement,  different query conditions have no problems.\r\n\r\n\tExample I test query like this , is no problem ：\r\n\t\tUserInfoExample example = new UserInfoExample();\r\n\t\texample.createCriteria().andPasswordEqualTo(\"password 555500\");\r\n\t\texample.setOrderByClause(\"create_time\");\r\n\t\tList<UserInfo> users = userInfoMapper.selectByExample(example);\r\n\t\r\n\tThis result is correct.\r\n\t\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior, such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.**\r\n\t1.Insert 4 million pieces of data\r\n\r\n\t2.Generate mapper, model, mapper.xml using mybatis-generator\r\n\r\n\t3.sharding db rule ： ds-$->{0..1}.user_info_$->{0..1}； sharding-table rule ： user_info_$->{user_id % 4 /2}\r\n\r\n\t4.No exception。\r\n\r\n**Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github link).**\r\n\r\n\tImitate sharding-jdbc-springboot-start to package my own springbootstart\r\n\r\n\tsharding-jdbc-db : https://gitee.com/vipmos/sharding-jdbc-db.git\r\n\r\n\tdemo springboot project：  https://gitee.com/vipmos/paas-demo.git  use application-sharding2.properties\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/446091971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/446092469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1593#issuecomment-446092469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1593","id":446092469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjA5MjQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"jie04baichi","id":3363025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjMwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3363025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi","html_url":"https://github.com/jie04baichi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jie04baichi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-11T06:53:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T06:53:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > And the following four data appear user_id: 279023793651843070, this id is not a record in the database\r\n> \r\n> > The result is that the user_id is duplicated, using the mybatis framework, please take the time to reply as soon as possible, thank you.\r\n> \r\n> At first you say id is not a record in the database, then you say user_id is duplicated, what do you mean?\r\n\r\nIn two cases, one is that the user_id is duplicated, and the other is that there is no user_id in the database.
