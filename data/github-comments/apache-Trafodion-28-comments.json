This is all new. You are right that it will introduce a  hiccup for IUA operations.  what moved out of the mxlobsrvr process is the regular processing of inser/updates/deletes itself. All LOB metadata operations were done in the mxlobsrvr process and all hdfs operations in the master (in a serial manner). There was no need for the process hop in that case. Hence moved that functionality into the master.\nNow for GC itself, when have a new Util operator/syntax that can be issued offline, we will consider doing the GC in the mxlobsrvr process. For now it's part of the master. Is that clearer ?

SO made changes to remove the hardcoding and use the CQD value in all places. The changes are not for hive access. They are limited tot the places where we are doing LOB data reads and writes.
