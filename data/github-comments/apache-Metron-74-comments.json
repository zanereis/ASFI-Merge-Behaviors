There might be an issue with ES's Bulk Writer refresh policy (or the way that we use it) that we are relying on in those tests.  I ended up not relying on it for #1247 which may help, but may not solve the entire issue if that is the root cause.

Then if said base image is missing (or possibly has changed properties, e.g. HDP version) rebuild it, and if found just build Metron and install mpack?  Or alternatively, don't load the end result to Vagrant Cloud, just upload the base image we install on top of.  Then only update it on a base image update.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that it would be nice to be able to build off of master, in a way that doesn't require an external dependency, and still lets us cache off the majority of the install (setting up HDP and Ambari). At that point, full dev would essentially be (for most builds) \"build metron, build RPMs, run up image, do Metron install and setup\".

I would expect this to be a reasonable expectation for people with sufficiently large Metron installs (or many tenants or whatever).  I expect that to influence the decision here.\r\n- re: topology file. Can you give a bit more detail on the pros/cons?  Is there any standard that other implementors are using or recommendations in the docs?\r\n\r\n**Adding Knox to the stack**\r\n- As noted above, multiple Knox instances with load balancer is a potential configuration users will want. In that case, colocation is not a given.\r\n- I don't think Knox as a required service is a given.  I wish Ambari let you have optional services and gate things more directly. We might be able to mimic that functionality by hiding the relevant configs unless Knox is enabled. It might still require the user to hit a toggle, but it might be possible to check against a Knox service config directly for that.  I've never tried it (and it might be nice to do in general for some of our other configs, e.g. Solr and ES).\r\n\r\n**Ambari Automation**\r\n- I'm inclined to consider Ambari necessary for effort as a whole to be really done.  I'd prefer it to be done now just to have it done and coherent, but I'm fine with it being a follow-on PR (given the usual assumptions that everything continues to work as expected and is documented, otherwise I'd be inclined to use feature branch). It means docs are throwaway once that goes in, but I'm personally fine with it being manually documented then automated later.\r\n\r\n**Quick Links**\r\n- As mentioned above, I think we're out of luck here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/441668304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/441681777","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1249#issuecomment-441681777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1249","id":441681777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTY4MTc3Nw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-26T15:35:27Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T15:35:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's go with what @nickwallen said","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/441681777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/441697110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275#issuecomment-441697110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1275","id":441697110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTY5NzExMA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-26T16:11:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T16:11:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback @justinleet.\r\n\r\n- Colocating: You bring up a good point about multiple Knox instances.  The primary challenge here is that enabling Metron on Knox requires copying files to local directories on each Knox Gateway.  If Knox exposed this through a REST API or could read files from HDFS this would not be an issue but I'm not aware that either of those options are supported.  This is not an issue with other services (HDFS, HBase, etc) because those services have been added to the Knox project and are installed along with Knox.  We could go that route but there are some major drawbacks (see the \"Knox SSO feature branch review and features\" discussion thread).  It's not clear to me how we solve this in an automated way.  Is this (copying Metron files to Knox Gateway hosts) possible with Ambari?\r\n\r\n- Custom topology vs Knox default: There are several advantages to maintaining our own topology file:\r\n\r\n  - We have complete control over how we expose settings in Ambari.  The Knox default topology is exposed in Ambari as raw xml.\r\n  - We have control over the url value where the Knox default url is `/gateway/default/<service name>`.  There may be a way to change this but I don't know how.\r\n  - The topology file will be smaller and easier to understand because it only contains Metron services.\r\n\r\n  The main disadvantage I see is related to the issue described above:  we need a way to copy this \r\n  file to Knox Gateway hosts and update it.\r\n\r\n- Ambari automation: I do believe everything still works as before in this PR.  I think some decisions we make here will influence that work so a follow on seems appropriate to me.\r\n\r\n- Quick Links: I agree, looks like we're out of luck here.  I think we'll either need to make Knox the default and make the Metron quick links match or live with quick links being updated manually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/441697110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/441707042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1261#issuecomment-441707042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1261","id":441707042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTcwNzA0Mg==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-26T16:37:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T16:37:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JonZeolla - would it make sense to add ShellCheck to Travis?

I dunno, have we just re-hashed quickdev here? I can't recall specifically how or why it became problematic for us to maintain.

What happens if you call a function that failed to load?  What happens if it is nested in a match or a lambda?\r\n\r\nRight now, it blows up, but when loaded everything is known to be 'ok'.  So this introduces a new state where we are loaded, but things that were supposed to load ( stellar functions introduced to the class path ) have failed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is that simple.  Would we _ever_ for example accept this state in the topology?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443429410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443429456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1288#issuecomment-443429456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1288","id":443429456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzQyOTQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-01T14:18:32Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T14:18:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cestella should check in on this","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443429456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443430967","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1288#issuecomment-443430967","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1288","id":443430967,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzQzMDk2Nw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-01T14:41:52Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T14:42:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is just one less function available on the classpath when this happens.

If an Exception is thrown, instead of N functions ready-to-rock, we would have N-1 functions.  This just expands that behavior to `ClassNotFoundException` which gets thrown when there is a missing dependency..\r\n\r\n> Before we would have crashed starting up.

I don't want to worry about the missing dependency for a function that I have no knowledge about.\r\n* If I am using the REST function, an exception would still be thrown when the function definition could not be found.  So the user still gets an exception when there is a problem with a function they are using.\r\n\r\n(Q) Any thoughts on alternative approaches?\r\n\r\nI prefer not to have to worry about classpath dependencies (like those required by the REST function) that I am not using.  In this example, I was only trying to use the `STATS_*` functions, but it was the REST function that blew things up for me.  It is difficult for a user to track this down, because they have no knowledge of the REST function and its dependencies.  Are there other ways we could handle this?\r\n\r\n(Alternative 1) An alternative approach would be to be more selective about what functions we add to `stellar-common`.  Anything added to `stellar-common` forces a required dependency on all Stellar users.  If the REST function had been a separate project, then a user could choose to use or not use that project and not be burdened by the additional dependency\r\n\r\n(Alternative 2) Could the `stellar.function.resolver.includes` and `stellar.function.resolver.excludes` be enhanced to allow users to exclude functions they don't want to load?  I am not sure if it works that way today.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443728967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443729669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1287#issuecomment-443729669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1287","id":443729669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzcyOTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-03T14:31:51Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T14:31:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Specifically my issue is that when I attempt to connect to a kafka broker as a part of the bro plugin via `node1:6667` it fails because it's not listening at the IP that hostmanager inserts into `/etc/hosts`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443729669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/443742012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1280#issuecomment-443742012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1280","id":443742012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Mzc0MjAxMg==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-03T15:06:38Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T15:06:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\nTests in error: \r\n  ProfilerIntegrationTest.testEventTime:281 Â» Timeout\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnrelated test failure, which is tracked as METRON-1810 (and I am trying to fix on the side.)
