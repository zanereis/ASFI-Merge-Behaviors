Thanks for the suggestion of editing the original migration file directly. I feel its a bit hacky :) It also goes against the alembic approach. \r\n\r\nI feel the problem isn't related to sqlite itself: Meaning, yes the alembic code needs to be different for sqlite vs non sqlite codepaths but that can be refactored away. \r\n\r\nI think the migration code I have here is fine, except that it breaks some obscure feature of export/import. So I am wondering if you think we should first try to fix that and if that does not work, then fall back to modifying the older migration scripts ?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ? Or I can always give up and hack it to what you are suggesting :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/457308503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/457323953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6751#issuecomment-457323953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6751","id":457323953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzMyMzk1Mw==","user":{"login":"MarcusSorealheis","id":2353608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis","html_url":"https://github.com/MarcusSorealheis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T19:24:43Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T19:24:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure why this would have failed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/457323953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/457325501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6751#issuecomment-457325501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6751","id":457325501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzMyNTUwMQ==","user":{"login":"MarcusSorealheis","id":2353608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis","html_url":"https://github.com/MarcusSorealheis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarcusSorealheis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T19:28:35Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T19:28:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kristw is there a way to kick off tests in the comments?

I am not able to repro it with our Pinot installation but let me give the open source docker one a spin. I am wondering if you could please copy/paste (pastebin preferred) me the superset server's logs. I did notice that I have to make the schema name match the table name. (Although pinot does not really have any notion of schema per se, so I can change that). Can you try with choosing schema=baseballStats please. Thanks.

Superset is correctly getting the tables, and schemata!\r\n(Yay!)\r\nWhen you try to access a file-based table via Drill, there’s one small problem.\r\nAs I mentioned in the PR, the issue is that filenames have dots in them, so when the schema was being passed to Superset you might have something like this\r\n`dfs.test.somefile.csv`\r\nThe problem being that when Superset parses that, it parses that fourth period as a part of the namespace rather than a file extension\r\nSo… the workaround I found was, in the dropdown in sqllab, replace the value (not the label) with `@@@` so that it gets parsed correctly.\r\nThis works as shown below:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2019-01-21 at 16 46 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5513150/51756888-099a5700-2090-11e9-9ece-4c54cc397535.png)\r\n\r\nHere's where I'm stuck. \r\n\r\nIn all the other functions where I could find this, I added a hook to clean up the file name, specifically, to look for `@@@` and replace it with a `.`.\r\nI can’t seem to find the code that generates the heading for the table preview and the heading for the column listing.   Once I can figure this out, I think Drill will pretty much work perfectly with Superset!!  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  @mistercrunch @kristw \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2019-01-21 at 16 48
