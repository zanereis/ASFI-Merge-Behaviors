Storage options are the largest amount of code, and sometimes, their dependencies end up conflicting with others. This is especially the case for the zipkin-dependencies job.\n\nThe tricky part about starting in zipkin main repo is also about who will use it. So typically, we collect interest first for the reason I mentioned on the issue (end users I mean). The contrib approach gives a chance to prove it without blocking albeit needing a separate docker image to use it. \n\nAfter end users start demanding it integrated in the main repo we can look at the dependencies of the contrib repo in question, viability in the dependencies job and if another author will maintain it. If things align we can consider integrating it later i mean.\n\nThere are cases where that doesn't make sense or lacks the contributor time end users to move forward. Also in contrib there is a Kafka option by @jeqo which was very clever and well done even obviating the need for a dependencies (service topology) job. From a solution viewpoint, it is somewhat standalone even if likely the library dependencies would be no different from what's already in zipkin. \n\nFinally, we always have to be careful what we put into the box (particularly storage) due to match of user demand. Postgres has been requested for years as a replacement for mysql, and not doing that while adding things so far with little demand can make some jealous.\n\nAnyway I hope I covered all the points on this topic ;)\n\n\nIf you add willing to start in a contrib repo, look at what @making has done there on zipkin-otel. If agreeable, @reta or I can make you a repo there noting I will be out next two weeks.\n\nMeanwhile anyone interested in this here (upstream) or in contrb please 👍 this issue and if you have an interesting reason why you want this or when please comment about it.\n\nCheers!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2645959744/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2645984817","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3790#issuecomment-2645984817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3790","id":2645984817,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc6dtoYx","user":{"login":"reta","id":509855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta","html_url":"https://github.com/reta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-08T23:44:17Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T23:44:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @CodePrometheus  for this feature,  I double @codefromthecrypt 's suggestion to go with contrib first, happy to help here","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2645984817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
