In some edge cases, we have to write complex Regex to parse this log.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I want to challenge this. The logs are very traditional things, I haven't seen which log framework put the JSON format output as a high priority thing. `Parsing log` in the logstash(or similar thing) is existing for a long time, and powerful enough.\r\nAlso, what is the point to analyze SkyWalking agent's log? It nearly outputs nothing.\r\n\r\nFYI @kezhenxu94 @JaredTan95 and @apache/skywalking-committers , are any of you feel this is necessary?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/676907458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/676914112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5311#issuecomment-676914112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5311","id":676914112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjkxNDExMg==","user":{"login":"xbkaishui","id":1477791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Nzc3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1477791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui","html_url":"https://github.com/xbkaishui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xbkaishui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T03:10:08Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T03:10:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @naah69 can you provide more detail about this bug? how to reproduce this bug (code) ?   thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/676914112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/676932907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5357#issuecomment-676932907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5357","id":676932907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjkzMjkwNw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T03:23:01Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T03:23:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am forwarding this discussion(whether accept this) to the mail list. \r\n\r\n> Mail list: dev@skywalking.apache.org. \r\n\r\nMail to dev-subscribe@skywalking.apache.org, follow the reply to subscribe the mail list.\r\n\r\nYou could read the mail list from the web page, https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@skywalking.apache.org.

For example, in golang gRPC creates goroutine per `unary` request to avoid this.\r\n  - In general, gRPC avoids head of line blocking (@lizan can keep me honest here)\r\n- Like Dhi points out in the document he links, SW collector use case is not _really_ one that's intended for streaming gRPC (though in practice it performs better, so it makes sense to use it for most agents).\r\n\r\n> I think you will only have one channel and one stub for sending this.\r\n> My understanding, this is no real one-way call, as unary, you need to wait for the previous list sent completed.\r\n> My experience is for the agent case, streaming could perform better in a large data set. So, depending on the Envoy team.\r\n\r\nI think this is the key confusion - @dio can correct me - but I believe we'd have a stub per Envoy-worker-process, not just a single stub. This is part of what results in the simplification in code on Envoy side. Further, multiple unary RPCs with the same stub won't block each other. gRPC uses H2 multiplexing here; when it comes to literally writing the bytes to the wire, it uses a round-robin strategy across pending requests so that small requests \"flow past\" large ones. (Again, @lizan please correct me if I got some of the gRPC internals wrong.)\r\n\r\nOverall glad to see y'all are fine to add unary - thanks @wu-sheng!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/677711581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/677718484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5358#issuecomment-677718484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5358","id":677718484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzcxODQ4NA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T14:59:47Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T14:59:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Unary definitely works for me, no concern at the SkyWalking side.\r\n\r\n@dio Have you separated the trace data into 2 spans?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/677718484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/677724118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5359#issuecomment-677724118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5359","id":677724118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzcyNDExOA==","user":{"login":"whfjam","id":45580443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTgwNDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45580443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam","html_url":"https://github.com/whfjam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whfjam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T15:09:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T15:09:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n> \r\n> Does this affect your application?

So it is pretty easy to use stream rpc as unary. Just use as it is an unary. \r\n\r\n> * Like Lizan says, `unary` is just a special case of `stream`\r\n>   \r\n>   * `unary` is a `stream` that has exactly 1 message sent and received; `stream` can be `n` messages sent `m` messages received\r\n>   * Because of this, `unary` can have slightly _worse_ performance than `stream` in many/most cases\r\n> * Like Sheng says, there is no `one-way` (i.e. \"fire and forget\") calls in gRPC - `unary` gRPC requires a response (even if the response is empty)\r\n>   \r\n>   * This _can_ affect throughput in some cases, depending on how exactly the client and server are pooling threads that handle gRPC requests\r\n\r\nWhile gRPC requires a response, it doesn't block the stream, i.e. you don't have to wait any response before sending next batch. The only caveats is H2 flow control, that depends on how server applies that to the stream.\r\n\r\nSo based on that I don't see a point of adding an unary, it doesn't make performance better or implementation easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/677965373/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/677975223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5358#issuecomment-677975223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5358","id":677975223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Nzk3NTIyMw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T00:40:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T00:40:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Envoy doesn't use gPRC generated code, and the async client doesn't make specialization for unary.\r\n\r\n@dio Please talk with Lizan.
