Here are the changes I made:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Added a few latches to checkBackgroundRetry() in CuratorFrameworkImpl.java. E.g. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Randgalt/a5ab016c5dcab8bac9cee223932548c2\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://gist.github.com/Randgalt/a5ab016c5dcab8bac9cee223932548c2</a></li>\n\t<li>Wrote a test that takes advantage of these: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Randgalt/0e070e073b0aff07e9b1b19a5a025bf4\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://gist.github.com/Randgalt/0e070e073b0aff07e9b1b19a5a025bf4</a>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The test creates the condition described in this issue. It stops the server and then creates a node via async/background</li>\n\t\t<li>Because the server is stopped, and the debug latches are set, the code will end up blocking just before validateConnection() is called</li>\n\t\t<li>The server is then restarted and the test waits for the connection state to return to \"RECONNECTED\"</li>\n\t\t<li>The debug latch is counted down so that validateConnection() gets called</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>As described in this issue, the connection state goes back to SUSPENDED. HOWEVER - the connection will repair itself after a period of time. Note that I commented out the final assert in the test so that it just keeps outputting the connection state received. If you run the test you will see this. </p>\n\n<p>I believe there is no bug here. Curator is doing the right thing. Curator version 2.x probably did the wrong thing but since 3.x has the enhanced handling of forcing session expirations, etc. Of course, this is very noisy when this happens but there's not much more that Curator can do - ZooKeeper <em>is</em> very noisy when there are network partitions.
