To my understanding, there is control flow fork based on whether or not we are in the IMRU phase or still in the load phase. If we are in IMRU, Evaluator failure shall indicate job failure, correct?\n\nNow, in the data load phase, the logic seems a bit more complex than it needs to be to me. Let me try to describe the logic as it makes sense to me below:\n\nWe need the following data structures:\n- A set of tasks to submit `TasksToSubmit`,\n- a set of submitted tasks `TasksSubmitted`,\n- a set of running tasks `TasksRunning` and\n- a dictionary from evaluator ID to successfully completed task `TasksCompleted`.\n\nThe value type of these would capture the configuration of the Task as well as any other metadata we might need. Given those data structures, the event handlers do the following:\n- `OnNext(IDriverStarted)` fills `TasksToSubmit` and requests enough Evaluators.\n- `OnNext(IAllocatedEvaluator)` submits the context and service configurations we need.\n- `OnNext(IActiveContext)` moves the task from `TasksToSubmit` to `TasksSubmitted`.  If we are past the load phase, it submits an IMRU task.\n- `OnNext(IRunningTask)` moves it from `TasksSubmitted` to `TasksRunning`\n- `OnNext(ICompletedTask)` moves it from `TasksRunning` to `TasksCompleted`. This handler also decides whether or not we have completed the load phase.\n- `OnNext(IFailedEvaluator)` looks up the task in `TasksRunning` and moves it back to `TasksToSubmit`. It also requests another Evaluator.\n\nOf course, all of these have an `if` to decide whether or not we are still in the load phase. It could make sense to capture all of this in an object which is an `IObservable<IActiveContext>` for the contexts on which the load tasks completed successfully. Although we might want to wrap the `IActiveContext` in additional metadata about the partition and such.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/139031987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/139032138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/468#issuecomment-139032138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/468","id":139032138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTAzMjEzOA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T20:09:33Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T20:09:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@beysims Thanks!
