Thanks for replying. I also verified even after updating `TableProperties.DEFAULT_NAME_MAPPING` to the proper json value containing the field-id, names and fields exactly mentioned in [here](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#name-mapping-serialization) such as in one of my table's metadata contains : \r\n```\r\n\"properties\" : {\r\n    \"schema.name-mapping.default\" : \"[{\\\"names\\\":[\\\"_fivetran_synced\\\"],\\\"field-id\\\":1},{\\\"names\\\":[\\\"id\\\"],\\\"field-id\\\":2},{\\\"names\\\":[\\\"attr\\\"],\\\"field-id\\\":3}]\",\r\n    \"table_type\" : \"ICEBERG\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill IcebergGenerics fails to read the table and fails with the same kind of exception : \r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.iceberg.types.Types$StringType cannot be cast to class org.apache.iceberg.types.Types$TimestampType (org.apache.iceberg.types.Types$StringType and org.apache.iceberg.types.Types$TimestampType are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think this should be considered as bug and it should be fixed in IcebergGenerics? \r\n\r\nRecently we learned that snowflake supports Iceberg table but because our parquet data files doesn't contain the field-ids it was showing all nulls. When we asked snowflake about it then they forwarded us the same [column projection link](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#column-projection) where it's written that \r\n```\r\nprojection must be done using field ids. If a field id is missing from a data file, its value for each row should be null\r\n```\r\nBut I wanted to your opinion too. I mean shouldn't any tool which is being used to read iceberg data be using fallback mechanism too if data files don't contain field-ids? I don't think the data files need to contain the field-ids. It's not because we didn't implement this. It's mainly because this information is anyway present in iceberg metadata json files. So same information doesn't need to be there in 2 places.

Or imagine that you simply wanted to drop column X and fill in a new column X with a different type. Again this is going to cause issues in hive because we have no way of differentiating old \"x\" from new \"x\"\r\n\r\nTo address issues like this Iceberg instead has a mapping between columns in files and the logical column in the table. \r\n\r\nIn Iceberg you end up with two different \"column x\"s each with a different field ID. Files written either have explicit field-id's written with their columns OR we need to give a backup mapping of those columns to a field ID. Remember, we now have 2 different X's in the tables history and in almost all situations we do not expect this data to be valid for both of these points in time. This is why field-id is required. The metadata.json only contains information about what field id maps to what column, the actual column name in the schema isn't relevant. If we used the current schema names as a mapping it would lead to resurrection/schema evolution issues (as noted above) when the schema changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1537525136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1537577962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/6149#issuecomment-1537577962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6149","id":1537577962,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bpZPq","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-08T00:10:55Z","updated_at":"2023-05-08T00:10:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 180 days with no activity.

Wouldn't this PR close this possibility by forcing the Sink to use `RowData`?\r\n\r\n@pvary `FlinkSink` can still support other input types (like Avro GenericRecord). The behavior (internally) is that all input type is converted to Flink `RowData`, which is the only supported record format for the underline file writer in Iceberg. \r\n\r\nThat is the reason why @huyuanfeng2018 was suggesting if `RowData` is[ the only key type we need to support](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7393). If in the future, Flink sink supports other record format for the underline file writer, maybe we can revisit this decision. for now, `RowData` is the only type Flink file writer supports.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1538652434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1538724487","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7389#issuecomment-1538724487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7389","id":1538724487,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85btxKH","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-08T16:57:26Z","updated_at":"2023-05-08T16:57:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @ajantha-bhat , thanks for asking, i havent started yet but I had planned to work on it probably late this week or next week, after some cleanup of this patch.

The usage is as follows:\r\n```\r\nCALL %s.system.rewrite_data_files(\r\n        table => '%s', \r\n        options => map('start-timestamp','1682677842000', 'end-timestamp','1682677843000')\r\n)\r\n\r\nCALL %s.system.rewrite_data_files(\r\n        table => '%s', \r\n        options => map('end-timestamp','1682677843000')\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> `rewrite where file.created_at < some timepoint`.\r\n\r\nThis syntax is very intuitive for users, but we don’t seem to keep the creation time of the files in the metadata, using the snapshot time achieve the same effect? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1539307538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1539316414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7311#issuecomment-1539316414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7311","id":1539316414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85bwBq-","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-09T02:57:24Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T02:57:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@clownxc Sure, feel free to take it.

I did get something working, mainly following the comment [here](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3117#issuecomment-1377037706), though converting it to maven.  One important point is that we are using the Table/SQL API (also from pyFlink), so are not explicitly instantiating the FlinkCatalog.  As such, we are dependent on [this code](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/bbe7a64d1c6f5b8b680c74caa9880f9e83a8d754/flink/v1.15/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/flink/FlinkDynamicTableFactory.java#L164).\r\n\r\nA few things:\r\n- Important here was the relocation/shading, which, for me not being a java programmer, took some time to get.  \r\n- I still had to include (some) hadoop libraries, but I was able to drop `'org.apache.flink:flink-hadoop-fs'` by writing my own `HadoopUtils::getHadoopConfiguration`  that returns `new Configuration(false);`.  I think it should be possible to \"hack\" in a `Configuration` class to avoid pulling in hadoop libraries, but I haven't dug more just yet.\r\n- One important thing I ran across was that flink does manipulate class loading (\"child first\" vs \"parent first\") [in general](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/ops/debugging/debugging_classloading/#inverted-class-loading-and-classloader-resolution-order), but explicitly *does not* do this for hadoop libraries (see [here](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/config/#classloader-parent-first-patterns-default)).  This could have been the source of problems that some other posters mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I would still classify this as workaround, but, since I had to piece this together, I think it would still somehow make sense to document this until the hadoop dependencies are fully removed.  I will try to come back and update this comment once I have wrapped things up.\r\n\r\n** EDIT: **\r\n\r\nI've placed the relevant code [here](https://gist.github.com/mgmarino/19a4a26a40dfbc7f4249e3c567d32afa) for those that want to take a look. The pom.xml file is simple *as is*, I didn't spend any time to filter out the things that aren't needed. However, the relocations/shading configurations are basically all needed. Another note is that we did need to explicitly instantiate the Catalog, which is why we introduced a light wrapper in python calling through to the jvm.

@aokolnychyi and @rdblue, \r\n\r\nI just created a single parquet file with a million sorted unique timestamp (partition value) and the same schema as expected partition stats. The file size turned out to be 12.6MB, Unsorted random file was around 30MB.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ajantha-bhat/3401f2a29ddfa6b2b42f9168461ce98b \r\n\r\n**I agree that rewriting the whole file is expensive once the data grows. But creating multiple small files for incremental updates will not sort whole data and may slow the look-up of partition values during query.** \r\n\r\nAlso, just summarising the plan we had for partition stats: \r\n  Step 1: define the partition stats schema and requirements then add them to the Iceberg spec.\r\n  \r\n  Step 2: define how to track partition stats files and add it to the Iceberg spec. (relies on step 1)\r\n  \r\n  Step 3: build a util to create a partition stats file for a table on a single node, like how the partitions table currently works (relies on step 1)\r\n  \r\n  Step 4: implement stats file tracking (relies on step 2)\r\n  \r\n  Step 5: build incremental update for a stats file based on incremental scan (relies on step 3)\r\n  \r\n  Step 6: implement incremental update using commit stats (SnapshotSummary) and add a flag to turn it off (relies on steps 3 and 4 and possibly 5)\r\n  \r\n  Step 7: implement parallel stats using metadata tables and a store

If I remember correctly, we added `NoStatsUnaryNode` to prevent issues with broadcast nested loop joins when the target would be the broadcasted side. It is an extremely edge case as the target must be smaller and there must be no equality condition in the ON clause. That means we should probably keep it for now unless it causes a performance degradation. Then we may workaround it.\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to provide an explicit hint to prefer a shuffle hash join as such joins can lead to OOM if the size of each partition after the shuffle on the build size is too big to fit into memory. We highly advise our users to configure Spark to use shuffle hash joins but that's not always possible.
