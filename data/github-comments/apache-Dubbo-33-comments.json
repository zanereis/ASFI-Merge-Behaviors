Session是通过拦截Cookie、URL特定参数获取sessionId，再去Redis里寻找 相对应的session信息。\r\n\r\n如此，Dubbo发送的URL里只要添加特定参数，那么，Spring Session首先拦截获取到sessionId就可以共享session了，不必变更业务代码了。否则，重构量很大。\r\n\r\n我在寻找能在Dubbo consume端向provide端发送URL时，加入特定参数，以达到发送sessionId给provide端，让Spring Session自动拦截、获取、装载session。\r\n\r\n即：如何给Dubbo URL里添加特定参数？？？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/365374998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/366137388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1373#issuecomment-366137388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1373","id":366137388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjEzNzM4OA==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T03:49:18Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T03:49:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"congratulations","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/366137388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/366157240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1373#issuecomment-366157240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1373","id":366157240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjE1NzI0MA==","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T06:48:49Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T06:48:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"great!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/366157240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/366229635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/1373#issuecomment-366229635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1373","id":366229635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjIyOTYzNQ==","user":{"login":"Authorlove","id":5318474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTg0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5318474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove","html_url":"https://github.com/Authorlove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Authorlove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T13:03:01Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T13:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cheers！","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/366229635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocke
