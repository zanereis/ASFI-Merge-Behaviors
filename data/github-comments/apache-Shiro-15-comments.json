If you'd rather skip all updates until the next major or minor version, let me know by commenting `@dependabot ignore this major version` or `@dependabot ignore this minor version`. You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1601958413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/1602505081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/945#issuecomment-1602505081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/945","id":1602505081,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s5fhEl5","user":{"login":"bmarwell","id":1413391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell","html_url":"https://github.com/bmarwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-22T11:53:44Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T11:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We also need to remove the logback.xml file in main resource and replace it by a log4j2 default config file\r\n\r\nPlease check if the config works for you (by executing the app manually, for example).

looked into it, as I am in a rush right now.\r\n\r\nIf it works, you should get a message that checkstyle was executed for every module when running `mvn verify` on Shiro. It will probably break something too.\r\n\r\nIf you get to that point, create the PR and point out what did break and why. If there's just small fixes needed (eg whitespace changes), just do a second commit with the fixes. In any other case, we *might* want to exclude some modules from checking or just do a big \"fix up all\" commit and add it to [a special ignore file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view).
