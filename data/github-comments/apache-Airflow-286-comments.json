This is something that we are working on as part of AIP-4: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-4+Support+for+System+Tests+for+external+systems - but I think it requires a few prerequisites before we vote/approve changes in there. such as moving out of Travis CI (we switched from migrating to GitLab to migrating to Github Actions) and securing some regular credits from AWS/GoogleCloud/Microsoft Azure - so that we can run those tests regularly + pytest markers to distinguish those tests and run them only when we run them \"with system tests\". All of these prerequisites are in progress :)\r\n> \r\n> I think for now its enough - once we have a basic framework for running the system tests (and some credits provided by Google Cloud/AWS/Azure) we might revisit that and add more tests for that.\r\n\r\nAh, that makes sense.

That is, using subprocess incurs the overheads of multiprocessing, which should be avoided by async coroutines - right?  I guess the point is that the event loop must start somewhere and this PR targets a new worker to manage an event loop?  It just seems like the worker should be able to directly await an async callable (task/coroutine) without spawning it in a subprocess.  (I guess it might make sense to rename this PR as `multiprocessing using asyncio`.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569562651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569596211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6950#issuecomment-569596211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6950","id":569596211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTU5NjIxMQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-30T06:36:55Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T06:36:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> These functions are used by users, so we should think about backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nYep.

It uses a single thread but switches off what coroutine uses that thread based on readiness. This is actually a pretty important distinction when it comes to parallel processing in python. @ash recently made some changes to the LocalExecutor to use os.fork instead of processes, this makes the multithreading in the LocalExecutor much faster and lighter weight.\n\nI don’t think that there’s really that much blocking in our operators outside of specific ones that are making SQL calls etc. I don’t think this would be more performant than the current LocalExecutor but would be glad to discuss potential benefits I’m not seeing/if you’ve done speed comparisons.\n\nvia Newton Mail

Hence dynamic pooling can help control the spark cluster capacity directly from the Airflow using pools. this is aligned to the following jira ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1467 \r\n\r\nThe problem statement mentioned in the jira ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6227, can be handled via locking a file for write. That is, if the ask is to keep one writer on a table, then before triggering spark job, create another task that will put a file write lock on a file (name same as table name) in the file system (libraries such as fasteners or lockfile in a python operator can be used). This will make sure that at a time only one job will be triggered for the said table and makes the code more dynamic rather than creating pools every time a new table is introduced. and once the spark job finishes (weather the job fail or pass) then release the lock from the file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569917507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/569918440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6950#issuecomment-569918440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6950","id":569918440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTkxODQ0MA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T12:04:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T12:04:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhongjiajie
