For the API, I think separating svd and svds would be a better design. The user should choose which implementation (dense or sparse) to use based on the application. For svd, we can keep the old signature. For svds I think it's necessary to expose tolerance and max_iterations. There could be 2 computeSVD: computeSVD(k, computeU) // 0 < k <= ncomputeSVD(k, computeU, rCond)and 2 computeSparseSVD: computeSparseSVD(k, computeU) // 0 < k <ncomputeSparseSVD(k, computeU, rCond, tol, maxIterations)\nThis will simplify invokes from Java. What do you think?\nOne related API is the MatrixFactorizationModel in recommendation. It has RDD[(Int, Array[Double])] type for both users and products. Since will be able to decompose large scale matrices with sparse svd, the Int index might be a limitation. Would it be possible to change to RDD[(Long, Array[Double])]? or more generally RDD[(UType, Array[Double])] and RDD[(PType, Array[Double])]\nAnother question is about the computeSVD function in IndexedRowMatrix. There the indices are directly zipped with computed U. What if the order of rows of U changed when computing the SVD? Is preserving the ordering part of Spark API contract? \nCheers,Li\nDate: Tue, 17 Jun 2014 22:55:58 -0700\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: spark@noreply.github.com\nCC: li.pu@outlook.com\nSubject: Re: [spark] SPARK-1782: svd for sparse matrix using ARPACK (#964)\n\n@vrilleup Thanks for updating the PR! I made a comment on the explicit type checks. I'm a little confused about the new API. If isDenseSVD is true, tol doesn't mean anything. In MATLAB and SciPy, svds and svd are separate functions. We should either do the same or hide the parameters from users. Having computeSVD(k, computeU) should be sufficient for most users. What do you think?\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.                    \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46405519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46405754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1091#issuecomment-46405754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1091","id":46405754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDA1NzU0","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-18T07:53:19Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T07:53:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for working on this, @ScrapCodes.

I think one viable design is to\nmake StorageLevel get constructed via a builder pattern.

taken a first pass at this and at a high level it looks good.\n\nThe main two things I'd say are\n1) I think an implicit that converts LabeledPoint to WeightedLabeledPoint could go a long way at removing some of the boilerplate introduced by this PR.\n2) I'm getting a little concerned that we could modularize a little better - for example, every time we do a \"strategy.algo match\" - it feels like we could just as easily have a separate class for Regression algo, Decision algo, etc. For example, each separate algo could implement its own \"binSeqOp\" and a few other methods and the base class could tie these all together. This would be a fairly major refactoring and is maybe better suited for a later PR.\n\nI still need to look closely at the principal logical changes in DecisionTree.scala - and will try to get to this before the end of the week.
