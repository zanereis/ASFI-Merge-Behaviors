The compiler is written to allow for the Old Cocoa/Swift with a compiler flag, so anyone still using swift 1 or 2 should still be able to use the Cocoa style generator but will have to use a compiler flag\r\n- I don't believe thats documented anywhere\r\n- No tests written for this, that is future work\r\n- Should be exercisable in Travis though no tests currently\r\n- I'm not sure where the Swift compiler support for Xenial and Artful currently is, but should be available.\r\n- Given backwards compatibility with Cocoa/Swift generator this should work with all Swift versions v1 through v4 (for Swift 1 and 2, the Cocoa library which is Obj-C is required along with the cocoa flag when generating code, for Swift 3+ the dedicated Swift library is required)\r\n- LANGUAGES.md has not been updated\r\n- build/docker/README.md have not been updated\r\n- The cocoa implementation is separate from this implementation.  The Cocoa compiler/libraries exist for Obj-C, and Swift 1 & 2, whereas Swift 3+ operate independently without Cocoa (as Swift 3 and up can run on Linux without Obj-C runtime/libraries).  That being said the old Swift/Cocoa compiler is \"gone/removed\" and there is \"only 1 Swift compiler\" given the old Swift/Cocoa compiler is integrated in this as a compiler flag\r\n- Given this is a full rewrite it will not play nice with #1002, though since that PR is related to the Swift/Cocoa compiler and that has been integrated for backwards compatibility that PR can be rewritten to work with this.  My comments on that PR still stands, the style of \"Namespacing\" used there by prefixing class names is a Cocoa convention that is improper in Swift, This version does proper \"namespacing\" for Swift by putting generated files in namespaced folders which should then be imported as separate modules, adhering to Swift's module namespacing conventions, however for the Swiftv1+2/Cocoa side its an acceptable pattern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/379278919/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/379400103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1531#issuecomment-379400103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1531","id":379400103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTQwMDEwMw==","user":{"login":"NameFILIP","id":834796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/834796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP","html_url":"https://github.com/NameFILIP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-06T22:20:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T22:20:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @jeking3!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/379400103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/379401950","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1531#issuecomment-379401950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1531","id":379401950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTQwMTk1MA==","user":{"login":"NameFILIP","id":834796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDc5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/834796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP","html_url":"https://github.com/NameFILIP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NameFILIP/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-06T22:32:01Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T22:32:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"How often do you guys publish new versions?
