There is another potential race condition: crc in ZK metadata doesn't match the segment crc in deep store. This applies to any segment upload, not only to purge task.\r\nWhen a segment is newly added, we add the segment to IS as the last step, so worst case we might leave an orphan segment in ZK metadata or deep store. But when refreshing a segment, this mismatch might cause the segment being unavailable.\r\nI don't see an easy way to make these 2 operations atomic, so we can focus on how to make it recoverable (eventual consistency)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1612143722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1612197810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10996#issuecomment-1612197810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10996","id":1612197810,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5gGC-y","user":{"login":"navina","id":1909480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDk0ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1909480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina","html_url":"https://github.com/navina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-28T22:28:03Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T22:28:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc: @Jackie-Jiang @mayankshriv @npawar @mcvsubbu @yupeng9  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1612197810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1612198919","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10815#issuecomment-1612198919","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10815","id":1612198919,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5gGDQH","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-28T22:29:40Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T22:29:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Do we need to clean up tmp files periodically, or just when the controller starts?

your questions:\r\nStream level consumption basically involves a single server consuming all partitions of the stream. Therefore there are no guarantees that all replicas of the table (in realtime part) have the same data. Consequently, each replica independently \"closes\" the segment. Since the segments can have slightly different data, the segment name for each replica is different. Also, the \"closed\" segments are never uploaded to deep store. they are retained locally in the server. If the server goes down, then they need to start afresh (can't copy segments from some place else). \\\r\n\r\nEach server registers with a different consumer ID. The consumer IDs were also stored in zookeeper some place (and there is code somewhere there for that).\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of zookeeper watches on the controller. When each replica closed a segment, it would mark in segment zk metadata. controller watch would trigger, and it would create a new segment. \r\n\r\nAll this was an operational nightmare, and that is the reason we built LLC.

Thanks.\r\n\r\n1. It s a wrapper around the existing Pinot Client. A technical writeup is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/11zXGTKqyW-kykltpAyA71IDssZ1S04r4iv1AcdR94nc/edit?usp=sharing but it might be a bit dated because of the new information I discovered during the implementation so far.\r\n2. The usage should be similar to the existing Pinot Client, only the API provided will be Vert.x friendly. I will be making a demo application to demonstrate the use of the wrapper soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1614197285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1614220308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11011#issuecomment-1614220308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11011","id":1614220308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5gNwwU","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-30T07:02:17Z","updated_at":"2023-06-30T07:31:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11011?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\n> Merging [#11011](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/11011?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (5b89a67) into [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/379d7610ac58724d1dcfe5968ddad8bb37a988d3?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) (379d761) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master   #11011   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage    0.11%    0.11%           \n=======================================\n  Files        2192     2192           \n  Lines      118016   118016           \n  Branches    17869    17869           \n=======================================\n  Hits          137      137           \n  Misses     117859   117859           \n  Partials       20       20           \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1temurin11 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin17 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration1temurin20 | `?` | |\n| integration2temurin11 | `?` | |\n| integration2temurin17 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| integration2temurin20 | `?` | |\n| unittests1temurin11 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin17 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests1temurin20 | `0.00% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin11 | `0.11% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin17 | `0.11% <ø> (ø)` | |\n| unittests2temurin20 | `0.11% <ø> (ø)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
