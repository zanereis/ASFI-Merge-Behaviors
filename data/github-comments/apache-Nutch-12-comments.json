Excellent debugging 👍 ... you got further than me.\r\nI can't get around to testing it until next week at earliest. \r\nThinking back, I did observe revisits (recursive access) to URLStreamHandlerFactory but didn't pursue that line of inquiry at that point in time.\r\nTo get a bit more context I did review [HADOOP-14598-005.patch](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12880380/HADOOP-14598-005.patch). Reading the code made more sense but admittedly until I debug this I still don't have the full context.\r\nI took a look at [hadoop-hdfs TestUrlStreamHandler.java](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/TestUrlStreamHandler.java) as well which I really like the look of. To build out some more confidence in this aspect of the Nutch codebase, we could create some tests for the [nutch URLStreamHandlerFactory.java](https://github.com/apache/nutch/blob/master/src/java/org/apache/nutch/plugin/URLStreamHandlerFactory.java).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/1157149313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/1157159803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/735#issuecomment-1157159803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/735","id":1157159803,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmIs5E-Nt7","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-16T02:22:10Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T02:22:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll squash and merge commits into one when we are ready to merge into `master` branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/1157159803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/1165588041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/733#issuecomment-1165588041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/733","id":1165588041,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmIs5FeXZJ","user":{"login":"sebastian-nagel","id":1630582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastian-nagel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastian-nagel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-24T13:41:31Z","updated_at":"2022-06-24T13:41:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, this PR/patch was merged into [Common Crawl's \"production\" branch](/commoncrawl/nutch/) and successfully tested on a Hadoop cluster (3.2.3, Bigtop 3.1.0) of 30+ nodes and running various Nutch tools: inject, generate, fetch, updatedb, dedup, readdb. \r\n\r\n@lewismc: I've opened NUTCH-2954 to address your suggestion to add unit tests for the URL stream handlers.

Otherwise -- we have to rewrite the indexer-elastic plugin to use the Java API client (see [NUTCH-2927](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-2927)) or otherwise remove it due to the incompatible license (NUTCH-2960).

As said, I haven't tested it with a running OpenSearch instance. If you can confirm that docs/fields appear in the index as expected, that's fine. Otherwise, I can try to run an OpenSearch instance (would be my first time), index a bulk of docs using various index filter plugins (add to the property plugin.includes `index-(basic|more|anchor|geoip)`). This would be a more realistic test scenario.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/1454100003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/1454107912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/761#issuecomment-1454107912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/761","id":1454107912,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmIs5Wq-0I","user":{"login":"tballison","id":6739646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzk2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6739646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison","html_url":"https://github.com/tballison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tballison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-03T20:47:58Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T20:47:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've run this with both the docker \"getting started\" OpenSearch example  (e.g. `docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 -p 127.0.0.1:9600:9600 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" opensearchproject/opensearch:1.3.8` with username=admin and pw=admin) and with the example for running OpenSearch locally with the trust store in the [post above](https://opensearch.org/blog/connecting-java-high-level-rest-client-with-opensearch-over-https/)\r\n\r\nThe more tests the merrier! \r\n\r\nWe're using testcontainers over on Tika to test integration with OpenSearch and Solr.
