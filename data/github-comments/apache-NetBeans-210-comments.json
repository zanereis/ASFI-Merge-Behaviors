The NB implementation currently guesses whether the file should be parsed as a module based on the import and export keywords. A work around might be to add support for the `mjs` extension and let these file be parsed as modules by default.

I've been going off the MDN pages on [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) and [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) and have been uncertain how rigidly-defined modules are at this point in language terms.\r\n\r\nRegarding `.mjs` I note the \"Aside\" on the subject in the [MDN Modules page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#basic_example_structure) and think it is probably not (yet) a good determinant as it may be impractical for people to deploy with.\r\n\r\nThe only real-world example I can speak on is my own codebase, which I'm in the midst of rewriting (thus how I washed up here). Some time ago I adapted my existing class-loader code to employ dynamic `import()` due to the advantages of it being Promise-based and that it prevents repeat-downloading of a URI; but I maintained the actual class files as already written, which is that they declare themselves in global scope:\r\n```\r\nwindow.MyClass = class MyClass {...};\r\n```\r\nObviously this is a side-effect, which modules are discouraged from having, but not using `export` kept the door open to being able to load them by other means if desired.\r\n\r\nIt's _useful_ that `import()` can be employed in a non-module context, and upon files that bear no module-specific syntax; likewise that top-level `await` does not place any module-specific syntax requirements on its file either. However it's fairly clear such usage is not _intended_ so I'd understand if you demur on supporting it.\r\n\r\nWould a warning, rather than error, condition be a compromise worth considering? (In context where `export` or `import` are absent)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2140480171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2141222048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7191#issuecomment-2141222048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7191","id":2141222048,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5_oHSg","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-31T04:42:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T04:42:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I can't reproduce it with NB22.

about, oh i dont know, just adding the option to all together disabling the clipboard. The issue stem from the conflict of having 2 different clipboards, the OS system wide clipboard and NetBeans own clipboard. My guess is that its supposed to update the netbeans clipboard when you copy using the system clipboard but half the time fails to do so. Clearly the clipboard in NetBeans is broken to the degree its unusable so until someone fixes it, it should be disabled by default. Its been well over a decade, if it has ever worked properly, its about time it gets fixed, or disabled since nobody is fixing

looked a bit longer into this and my take on this that it can't be done without very ugly compromises.

However, that breaks in subtle ways. consider this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar await = 3;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf parsed as a module this is invalid code as the keyword `await` can not be used as an identifier, while in script mode that is totally fine.\r\n\r\nThe definition can be found a bit more wordy here (Note 1):\r\n\r\nhttps://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-async-function-definitions\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR version is, that you can't parse a JS file without knowing how it is going to be used, because grammar depends on that.

Even I don't think reverting this is a feasible solution! :smile:\r\n\r\nJust null'ing the `instDelegate` in `delegate0` like @eirikbakke patch fails a bunch of tests. (I had to move the test file into the right folder too to check that).  Looking at @sdedic comments on that JIRA report, I tried adding an `int hash;` field to the `Performer` class and then doing -\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate Object delegate0(Lookup.Provider everything, List<?> data, boolean getAction) {\r\n            int dataHash = data.hashCode();\r\n            if (hash != dataHash) {\r\n                hash = dataHash;\r\n                instDelegate = null;\r\n            }\r\n            Object d = instDelegate != null ? instDelegate.get() : null;\r\n            ////\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat seems to (partially) fix the terminal tab title issue for me, and all the tests still pass.  Not sure if that works for @eirikbakke other cases.  The data list appears to be the key to invalidating things.  The idea of actions listening on the `everything` lookup appears to be a red herring, as that is recreated on every call with fixed contents from the data list.  Holding a strong reference to the data list might be a bad idea though.  I hate code that relies on weak references for \"correct\" behaviour.\r\n\r\nI say partially fix the title issue, as there seems to be a secondary issue with the context not changing to an unfocused tab when invoking the menu on it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145368629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145402789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-2145402789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":2145402789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5_4D-l","user":{"login":"lalo-mx","id":7459881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTk4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7459881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx","html_url":"https://github.com/lalo-mx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lalo-mx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T14:50:17Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T14:50:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @TeKett contributions in this area are welcome - see eg. code in https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/platform/o.n.bootstrap/src/org/netbeans/NbClipboard.java Someone who can replicate the problem is far better placed to work on this.\r\n> \r\n> The other thing, as mentioned in #7396 , is for someone who can replicate this issue trying to run NetBeans on the JetBrains runtime JDK that includes the patch at [JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime@16257c3](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/commit/16257c3de7e858c8da3e453548f290e33718372d) We still do not know whether that is a factor here or not.\r\n\r\nNetbeans is stuck in starting with JetbrainsRuntime, nothing is written in messages.log.\r\n\r\n[jbr_jcef-21.0.3-windows-x64-b465.3.tar.gz](https://cache-redirector.jetbrains.com/intellij-jbr/jbr_jcef-21.0.3-windows-x64-b465.3.tar.gz)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145402789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145678214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7384#issuecomment-2145678214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7384","id":2145678214,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5_5HOG","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T16:44:36Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T16:44:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will merge shortly.

The problem is now, that to create a `WeakListener` you need access to the object you need to detach (in this case the `IONotifier` implementation) from when the listener is collected. \r\n\r\nI though about directly implementing the registration logic (essentially copying the `IONotifier#find` method), but discarded that so that the logic is all unified in `IONotifier`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145711190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145729251","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7430#issuecomment-2145729251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7430","id":2145729251,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5_5Trj","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T17:11:47Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T17:11:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The source of the events is indeed the TerminalInputOutput, _but the registration is not done on it._\r\n\r\nWhich is the problem IMO.  ie. the pcs() method construction code at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/ide/terminal.nb/src/org/netbeans/modules/terminal/ioprovider/TerminalInputOutput.java#L151 should be passing in the instance of `MyIONotifier` not `this`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145729251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2145804647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7430#issuecomment-2145804647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7430","id":2145804647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5_5mFn","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-03T17:56:56Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T17:56:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it is even more ugly as I though.
