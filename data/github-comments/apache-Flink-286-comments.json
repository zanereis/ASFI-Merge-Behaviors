you are right. \r\nBut there may be some points that can be misleading for some users:\r\n\r\n* Sometimes fields of the same name are more easily visually identified as having the same type;\r\n* Multiple test methods in `SetOperatorsITCase` explicitly specify the same fields (a, b, c) for the left and right Tables, because the document is just an incomplete example, sometimes after the user views the document, they will try to search the source code and see real cases in the project;\r\n* Other operators of multi-table operations in the same document such as `union`, `minus` also use the same field name\r\n\r\nThis is why I said LGTM.

not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/446808073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/446810382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7289#issuecomment-446810382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7289","id":446810382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NjgxMDM4Mg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-13T01:38:49Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:38:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

And again anything with a long parameter list is not only hard to read but also toxic for backward compatible code evolution.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would just have one parameter to execute, which could be of type `ExecutionParameters` and hold the job name as well as the savepoint info. Anything else that might be needed in the future can be added without breaking the interface contract. But that isn't easy to accomplish due to how the code has been cast. The difficulty comes from the protected executeRemotely method that we cannot change. How about passing the savepoint parameter or before mentioned new parameters holder through a thread local instead of the instance variable? The difference how we pass it internally is cosmetic and not important to the user. The question of savepoint vs. generalized execution parameters seems more interesting.

Having an actual limit (as is used through `ContaineredTaskManagerParameters`) will only result in a different error in case you are hitting it: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` instead of being killed by YARN/Mesos/etc. That may be better for diagnosing it but doesn't solve the root cause of something using up too much memory.\r\n\r\nWe also need to touch all memory calculations for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10317 again - maybe splitting this off is already enough for you? So having `totalContainerMem = heap + offHeap + Metaspace`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/447890879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/447920610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7286#issuecomment-447920610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7286","id":447920610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzkyMDYxMA==","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-17T17:05:01Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T17:05:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dianfu thanks for the explanation.
