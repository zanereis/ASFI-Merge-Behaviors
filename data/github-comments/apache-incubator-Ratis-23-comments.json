We're hopeful that this PR will bring about a notable performance improvement.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm wondering if it's necessary to check the cache log threshold exceeded limit every time we appendLog? Originally, traversing the list is a lightweight CPU operation, but due to its frequent invocation, it's incurring such a high CPU overhead, even if reduced to one traversal, it can't be ignored. If the LogSegment cache is now file-grained, could we further optimize it to only check when switching RaftLog?

It allows followers to handle read requests while maintaining strict linearizability. This will be the default and recommended option to use in IoTDB.\r\n\r\nLEASE is designed for situations where low latency is crucial, even at the potential cost of linearizability violations. The use of LEASE is mandated by Alluxio @codings-dan. His experiments have demonstrated that in a 3-node cluster, using LINEARIZABLE alone results in only a 160% improvement in throughput due to latency, whereas theoretically, it could achieve a 300% improvement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, IoTDB may consider employing this option if the potential benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nAlso, I added revoke mechanisms during leader-transfer / stepDown.

IMHO, the root cause is 'We can't find any majority without new peers in C_new'. \r\nBad cases example:\r\n1. Change from {n0} to {n0, ***n1***}.\r\n2. Change from {n0, n1, n2} to {n0, n1, n2, ***n3, n4, n5***}.\r\n3. Change from {n0, n1, n2} to {n0, ***n3, n4***}.\r\n4. Change from {n0, n1, n2} to {n0, n1, ***n3, n4***}.\r\n\r\nReplace/add/remove one by one can fit most cases. But fails in case 1, change from {n0} to {n0, n1}. \r\n\r\nThe solution might be:\r\n1. RaftServerImpl#setConfiguration checks the C_new. Throwing exception If it can't find any majority without new peers in C_new. This might be the easiest way to fix the problem. And the shortcoming is not allowing any conf conversion as described in raft paper.\r\n2. Configure vote whitelist for new peers. This is a little tricky, because we must remove the whitelist as soon as the new peers' conf is updated to old_and_new/transitional. Otherwise it may vote for the removed peer.\r\n3. Start each new peer with {C_old, peer_itself}. And when a server not in conf is asking for vote, don't let it crash.  Preventing nodes from crashing may cause very dangerous problems, which is probably why we let them crash. I haven't investigated it. Please help if you know the crash reason.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1772002266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1772244681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/943#issuecomment-1772244681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/943","id":1772244681,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5pok7J","user":{"login":"Brokenice0415","id":44429817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDI5ODE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44429817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415","html_url":"https://github.com/Brokenice0415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T07:44:17Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T07:49:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The solution 3 seems nice.\r\n\r\nThe reason of shutdown when NOT_IN_CONF is according to this #560 -- It may cause the failure of shutdowning a NOT_IN_CONF peer who still requests vote after the remove.\r\n\r\nAccording to the annotation below, we only shutdown candidate whose id is not included in conf **when the conf is stable**.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/ratis/blob/639f1bf0bc1d4b8c72e22cfcd50f3f1d2b7df641/ratis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/server/impl/RaftServerImpl.java#L1333-L1341\r\n\r\nSo maybe we should change the NOT_IN_CONF handler of request vote reply regardless of whether to use solution 3 or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1772244681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1772328833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/938#issuecomment-1772328833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/938","id":1772328833,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5po5eB","user":{"login":"SzyWilliam","id":48054931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDU0OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48054931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam","html_url":"https://github.com/SzyWilliam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SzyWilliam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-20T08:45:01Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T08:45:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@szetszwo, thanks for the reviews!

How could it be bad?\r\n\r\nHi @szetszwo , sorry for my late response. I made a test to simulate this case. Please have a look at TestMembership#testAddOneToOne. The procedure is as below.\r\n1. Originally we have a cluster with 1 node n0.\r\n2. Start n1 with empty conf.\r\n3. Call setConfiguration to n0. After n1 catches up, n0 changes conf to C_old_and_C_new.\r\n4. A network partition happens. n1 doesn't get conf C_old_and_C_new.\r\n5. n0 finds no majority because n1 doesn't answer. n0 quits and restarts election.\r\n6. Network partition recovers.\r\n7. n1 never votes to n0, so we won't have leader anymore.\r\n\r\nI think the reason is: All new peers' conf are empty while the peers in C_old has became transitional conf(C_old_and_C_new). Peer with transitional conf needs votes from both C_old majority and C_new majority. But 'We can't find any majority without new peers in C_new'. That's why we won' get new leader.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1774281969/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1774307566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/943#issuecomment-1774307566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/943","id":1774307566,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5pwcju","user":{"login":"wojiaodoubao","id":16864967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODY0OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16864967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao","html_url":"https://github.com/wojiaodoubao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojiaodoubao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T01:48:36Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T01:51:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @Brokenice0415, thanks your detailed explanation! If I understand correctly, 'setConfiguration before staring new peers' is right for most cases. There might be a small corner case as I'll descried below. Please help review whether it exists, thanks. I'll try to simulate it later.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we know 3 RaftServer behaviors:\r\n1. If a peer not in C_old is asking for votes from leader, leader will crash the peer. \r\n2. After we call 'setConfiguration', leader will start a new LogAppender thread, keep calling appendEntries to the new peer.\r\n3. If the new peer gets appendEntries, it will accept the leader as its leader.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe corner case is below. There is a race condition between 'leader appendEntries to peer 3' and 'peer 3 asks for vote from leader'.\r\n1. Originally we have a cluster with peer 0, 1, 2. Peer 0 is leader.\r\n4. SetConfiguration to peer 0, update conf from {0, 1, 2} to  {0, 1, 2, 3}.\r\n5. Peer 0 starts a new LogAppender thread responsible for peer 3.\r\n6. A network partition happens.\r\n7. Start peer 3.\r\n8. Network partition recovers.\r\n9. A race condition between 'leader appendEntries to peer 3' and 'peer 3 asks for vote from leader' happens. If 'asks for vote' gets first, peer 3 will shutdown.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1774307566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1774813634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/943#issuecomment-1774813634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/943","id":1774813634,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5pyYHC","user":{"login":"Brokenice0415","id":44429817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDI5ODE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44429817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415","html_url":"https://github.com/Brokenice0415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brokenice0415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T09:44:08Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T09:45:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @wojiaodoubao , I think that race may happen.\r\n\r\nI think it's difficult to distinguish the new peer from the removed old one when receiving vote request from a peer not in conf.\r\n\r\nHow about just restarting the crashed new peer, since the network partition has recovered and there is little likelihood of the partition happening again in such a short period of time?
