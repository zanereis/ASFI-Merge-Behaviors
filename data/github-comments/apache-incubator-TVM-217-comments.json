@comaniac Cody, thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nI just used the default parameters of 10 trails. All of 10 trails returned the same error (as shown below) when running the evaluation. The finally returned schedule (from `Autoschedule(policy, options)`) is the unoptimized schedule (with no thread or block binding so I was not able run it on GPU).\r\n```shell\r\n] (0) /home/sx/dlcb/build/tvm/build/libtvm.so(+0x1791844) [0x7f6429edf844]\r\n  File \"/home/sx/dlcb/build/tvm/src/runtime/cuda/cuda_device_api.cc\", line 115\r\nCUDA: Check failed: e == cudaSuccess || e == cudaErrorCudartUnloading: initialization error\r\n, all_cost:0.55, Tstamp:1602008338.18)\r\n```\r\nI tried to look into the problematic function (AllocateDataSpace:108) in `cuda_device_api.cc`. It seems that `cudaSetDevice()` does not able to find the device, and program builder just aborted from there. \r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    if (ctx.device_type == kDLCPUPinned) {\r\n      CUDA_CALL(cudaMallocHost(&ret, nbytes));\r\n    } else {\r\n      CUDA_CALL(cudaSetDevice(ctx.device_id));\r\n      CUDA_CALL(cudaMalloc(&ret, nbytes));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is quite wired. Everything can run smoothly using the python API. But when using C++ APIs, the runtime cannot detect the device or context, and thus cannot find usable schedules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/704469969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/704475952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6634#issuecomment-704475952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6634","id":704475952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDQ3NTk1Mg==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T18:41:42Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T18:42:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see, so the same setting and tuning task work with the Python APIs but not the C++ APIs.
