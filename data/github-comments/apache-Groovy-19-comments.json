Not sure whether I can  post....\r\n\r\n- Using the `ExtensionModule` feature, we have implemented multiple methods for easy `String` handling. Ex. `println 'some text here'.md5`\r\n- After this, intuitively I started coding as `println \"some $var\".md5`. But, it fails with error `No such property: md5 for class: org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.GStringImpl`\r\n- So, any method that is available in the `String` class in groovy environment due to a any of the below reasons, they should be made available in `GString` also. \r\n     * `String`'s native methods\r\n     * Using groovy extension module facilty\r\n     * custom meta class\r\n     * methods in StringGroovyMethods\r\n- Yes. There will be can be more than one method impls with same signature in these places. Groovy runtime can resolve the calls with some order. With some proper documentation, it can be educated to developers or script writers.\r\n\r\n`StringGroovyMethods` has lot of overloadings as `GString` variant to make the users feel transparant between `String` and `GString`. The idea is right. But, the way the methods are given to `GString` is very manual and can be made automatic using some ways...\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/447067277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/447183359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/806#issuecomment-447183359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/806","id":447183359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzE4MzM1OQ==","user":{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T01:39:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T01:39:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI,

As further background, we have delayed doing such changes earlier since having such differences between branches makes applying patches more difficult - often leads to manual merge fixes which although simple, can be a little painful for large patches. Since 2.5 and 3.0 both now have JDK 7 min (8 for 3.0) I think it is safe to do this change. If we ever want to backport some fixes and re-release another 2.4 release, we'll have to be a little careful. I'd recommend applying to both 2_5_X/master branches (where applicable) using two commits if needed (and if it makes it easier).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/458416752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/458418672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/864#issuecomment-458418672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/864","id":458418672,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODQxODY3Mg==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-29T06:05:17Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T06:05:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.

But the rehash methods do not guarantee that. But then again the implementation would be broken if they do not lock on rehash... actually I wonder who is actually calling that method.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion: Get rid of these classes. Java's concurrent hash map provides much better functionality, much better tested and afaik with a better performance profile.
