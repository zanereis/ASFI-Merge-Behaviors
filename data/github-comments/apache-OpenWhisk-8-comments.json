don't think is practical since a feed keeps sending events and firing triggers for the same feed, knowing that all are trigger is hard to define without saving state.\n\nFor example take web page, imaging that you want to  run a single action only with a set of events fire.\n\nFor example Q key is press, A key press and Z key press\n\nNow start pressing all 3 keys like crazy :-)\n\nThe events will not be fire at the same time, and will be multiple of each.\n\nNow do you want to run the action when? \n\nThe first time Q, A, Z are press no matter the order? \n\nI think user can implement today with current low level construct we have, by saving state/storage like a counter, increase until reach 3, then reset to 0 & fire a trigger for action to run.\none action will be in charge of increasing the counter and firing the trigger for the final rule that wants to run the action only when the 3 events have occurred\n\nmaybe I'm wrong and don't understand the use
