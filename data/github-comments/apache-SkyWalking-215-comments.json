The only things I've noticed that seem problematic is that `uuid` is not guaranteed to be unique. You can re-use the same `uuid` and the event system will accept it. \n\nAt OAP side, we choose to adopt the strategy \"two records for one event\" because we don't want to do updates for time series data like this. \"Two records for one event\" results in that no guarantee on the uniqueness of uuid at db level. If the users use the same UUIDs then the events should be considered as a single event according to our protocol. \n\n> Also, the `queryEvents` endpoint allows you to not define the start/end/step. I don't think other endpoints allow you not to specify the time range. Seems like it should be required.\n\nI'm not sure about the fact of what you said. Requiring those is easy at protocol level, though we may not want to use them when there is no necessity (e.g. when you have a uuid while the time is unsure but you have to give one). \n\n> Also, I don't seem to be able to update events. The following two commands:\n> \n> ```\n> \n> ./swctl-latest-linux-amd64 event r --uuid uuid3 --service service --name name --message message --startTime 1612225542333\n> \n> ./swctl-latest-linux-amd64 event r --uuid uuid3 --service service --name name --message message --startTime 1612225542333 --endTime 1612225542333\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> \n> Results in:\n> \n> ```\n> \n> {\n> \n>   \"data\": {\n> \n>     \"result\": {\n> \n>       \"events\": [\n> \n>         {\n> \n>           \"name\": \"name\",\n> \n>           \"source\": {\n> \n>             \"service\": \"service\",\n> \n>             \"serviceInstance\": \"\",\n> \n>             \"endpoint\": \"\"\n> \n>           },\n> \n>           \"startTime\": 1612225542333,\n> \n>           \"endTime\": 0,\n> \n>           \"message\": \"message\",\n> \n>           \"parameters\": [],\n> \n>           \"uuid\": \"uuid3\"\n> \n>         }\n> \n>       ]\n> \n>     }\n> \n>   }\n> \n> }\n> \n> ```\n\nThat must be a bug if it is really the case, which I don't think so, if you are using ElasticSearch as storage, attention that the writes are async and may need some time to flush them to ES, can you try some time later after the CLI commands? (e.g. 30 seconds or so).\n\n> \n> I'm using skywalking-cli @ https://github.com/apache/skywalking-cli/commit/ae085deb32434a0859e49c45819fed7a5c4010b5.

Let's remove all `required` and do composite verifications later.\n\n> Finally, there does not seem to be a way to set event parameters via skywalking-cli.\n\nThe parameters are set as arguments, i.e. `./swctl-latest-linux-amd64 event r --uuid uuid3 --service service --name name --message message --startTime 1612225542333 --endTime 1612225542333 key1=value key2=value2`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/771276078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/771289002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/6183#issuecomment-771289002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6183","id":771289002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MTI4OTAwMg==","user":{"login":"BFergerson","id":3278877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzg4Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3278877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson","html_url":"https://github.com/BFergerson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BFergerson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-02T01:54:56Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T01:54:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kezhenxu94, my thinking was that if you don't include the `uuid` then you have to include other conditions.

We need a cache for holding this sampling status in the runtime.\r\n1. Sample N(max) per minute for each internal error code. \r\n2. Sample M(max) per minute for not-internal error, which means service error or network error(at client side)\r\n\r\nAbout cache itself,  I think caffeine has better performance(please check the benchmark), but we don't use it in the core yet. Zipkin receiver uses it, so, it is already in the classpath and dependencies.\r\n\r\nBack the tag, I think internal error code and HTTP response code are reasonable tags at least.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/773285768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/773286061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6323#issuecomment-773286061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6323","id":773286061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzI4NjA2MQ==","user":{"login":"codering","id":2271825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzE4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2271825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering","html_url":"https://github.com/codering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codering/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T12:58:52Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T12:58:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"ref https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6224#issuecomment-763369708","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/773286061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/773286171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6323#issuecomment-773286171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6323","id":773286171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzI4NjE3MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T12:59:06Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T12:59:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a wrong example of submitting issue.
