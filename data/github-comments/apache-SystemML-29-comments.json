there are apparently a number of failed tests - I would recommend to start with tests like GLMDMLTest which currently fail with index out of bounds exceptions. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, we need to look at a couple of tests where the new rewrite destroys sparsity exploiting operators (e.g., WeightedUnaryMatrixMultTest, where W*(2*(U%*%t(V))) is reordered to something like 2*(W*(U%*%t(V)))) which creates an unnecessary sparse intermediate, while otherwise we would compile a single fused operator.

The shape would be `(C, F*Hf*Wf) = (1, 2*2*2)`.  Essentially, we are just taking the normal `(F, C, Hf, Wf)` filter tensor, transposing it to `(C, F, Hf, Wf)` and then flattening the latter three dimensions as usual to `(C, F*Hf*Wf)`.\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is to think about the shape of `W` during a regular 2D conv function, i.e. `(F, C, Hf, Wf)`.  In the forward *and* backward pass of regular 2D conv, `W` maintains the same `(F, C, Hf, Wf)`shape.  Specifically, in the backward pass, the data gradient function `conv2d_backward_data` accepts the same `W` of shape `(F, C, Hf, Wf)` to map from gradients wrt the output of shape `(N, F, Hout, Wout)` to gradients wrt to the input of shape `(N, C, Hin, Win)`.\r\n\r\nIn a 2D transpose conv function, we use the 2D conv data gradient function as the forward function.  If we use the same size terminology as from regular 2D conv, we would be mapping from an input with `F` channels to an output with `C` channels (which seems backward, but is correct since the forward pass of 2D transpose conv is defined as the backward pass of 2D conv), and we would be using the same filter `W` of shape `(F, C, Hf, Wf)`.  Now, in order to make the terminology of the 2D transpose conv layer consistent with the rest of the library, we would need to swap the variable names `F` and `C` so that we are mapping from an input with `C` channels to an output with `F` channels.  Thus, we would use a filter `W` of shape `(C, F, Hf, Wf`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/308267872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/308269538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/541#issuecomment-308269538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/541","id":308269538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODI2OTUzOA==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-13T22:42:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T22:42:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just pushed a fix for a bug in the associated unit test, and in the process have uncovered an optimizer bug.

Create `W` with shape `(F,C,Hin,Win)`:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nF = C = Hin = Win = 2\r\nw = np.array([20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37])\r\nw = w.reshape(F, C, Hin, Win)\r\nprint(w)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[[[[20 21]\r\n   [22 23]]\r\n\r\n  [[24 25]\r\n   [26 27]]]\r\n\r\n\r\n [[[30 31]\r\n   [32 33]]\r\n\r\n  [[34 35]\r\n   [36 37]]]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Transpose to `(C, F, Hin, Win)`:\r\n```python\r\nw = w.transpose(1, 0, 2, 3)  # (F,C,Hin,Win) -> (C,F,Hin,Win)\r\nprint(w)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[[[[20 21]\r\n   [22 23]]\r\n\r\n  [[30 31]\r\n   [32 33]]]\r\n\r\n\r\n [[[24 25]\r\n   [26 27]]\r\n\r\n  [[34 35]\r\n   [36 37]]]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

If we had that function, then this layer could accept the normal filter tensor `W` of shape `(F, C*Hin*Win)` and then just transpose it to `(C, F*Hin*Win)` before usage.  For this layer, the drawback to using that would be having to perform the transposition during every `forward` & `backward` call.\r\n\r\nTensorFlow follows the same approach of swapping the `F` & `C` dimensions for performance reasons (keep in mind that the spatial dimensions come first in TF).

Well for this particular PR, `conv2d_depthwise.dml` is the regular \"Convolution\", but I'm working on the related one for conv2d transpose (\"deconvolution\").  For the `groups` attribute, it will be a depthwise conv when `groups` is equal to the number of **input** channels, i.e. the `num_output` from the **previous** layer.  Also, I would think that Caffe will have an upper bound on the number of groups as the minimum of either the number of input channels or the number of filters.  Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to divide the number of input channels by the number of groups if there are more groups than input channels.  It would be worth checking on that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/309124931/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/309137048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/270#issuecomment-309137048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/270","id":309137048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTEzNzA0OA==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:21:12Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T21:21:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-PullRequestBuilder/1601/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/309137048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/309145241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/200#issuecomment-309145241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/200","id":309145241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTE0NTI0MQ==","user":{"login":"iyounus","id":8313847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTM4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8313847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus","html_url":"https://github.com/iyounus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyounus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T22:05:52Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T22:05:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would recommend to close this PR.
