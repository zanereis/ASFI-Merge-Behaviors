when I look at the old code then I see that the initial commit sort of worked. Then people added more to it so it broke completely. Mochi's accepts_content_type does everything correct but the problem is that the json check is before the html check and all web browsers promise to support basically everything with the q argument, so we get json when we should be getting a redirect. So yes it's a rollback but not just of one commit but many commits, that have tried to get the initial state back.\n\nOne thing to look at is maybe the default behaviour when not having accept should be json, but we would have to change that in both places.\n\nI have a patch where I do this, instead of accepts_content_type:\ncheck_header(MochiReq:get_header_value(\"Accept\"), \"application/json\")\ncheck_header(MochiReq:get_header_value(\"Accept\"), \"text/html\")\n\ncheck_header(undefined,_) ->  \n                false;                                                               \n\ncheck_header(Header, Value) ->  \n                case string:str(Header, Value) of  \n                0 ->  \n                    false;  \n                _ ->  \n                    true  \n                end.      \n\nBut the problem might be the xhtml browsers. The most important thing is that it's consistent in both couch_httpd and couch_chttpd\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/63244440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/63279882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/284#issuecomment-63279882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/284","id":63279882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjc5ODgy","user":{"login":"olafura","id":292662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjY2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura","html_url":"https://github.com/olafura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-17T09:39:41Z","updated_at":"2014-11-17T09:39:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I tend to complicate things with explanations :)\n\nIt's really simple, this patch is a rollback because bug. It also brings the 1.x.x series in line with what's in 2.0\n\nThis bug is one of the first ones I hit many years ago when I started using Couchdb, at the time I didn't know it was a bug. Just a really strange behavior, which I think is the case with most people. Futon and Fauxton have workarounds for this buggy behavior. People are using require_valid_user unnecessarily because of this with all it's Basic Authentication mess, having to close the browser to log out etc, and not being able to mix and match closed and open databases.\n\nIt's just a couple of lines of code that will make Couchdb much better and Couchapp are a lot better, just try it. Apply read protection on a database and visit it with this patch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/63279882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/63290153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/284#issuecomment-63290153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/284","id":63290153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMjkwMTUz","user":{"login":"kxepal","id":785983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTk4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal","html_url":"https://github.com/kxepal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kxepal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-17T11:13:01Z","updated_at":"2014-11-17T11:13:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@olafura awesome! could you give me a case how to reproduce it?

Because browsers say they support really anything with that value: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10496570/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-q-values-in-the-http-accept-request-header. \n\nEvery framework it seems at some point has someone that adds support for those thing and everything breaks.\n\nThe reason why the initial patch didn't break badly at first is that it only did the comparison on `text/html`, which kind of works. But then people added it also to `application/json`, and added that first which totally broke everything.\n\nThe intentions were good and I have a patch which is stricter about matching it to `text/html` and `application/json` that can be merged. But please don't try to propagate this bug to **chttp**.\n\nIf you do a web search you can find a lot of bugs caused by respecting the q value plus wild card usage when doing comparisons. It's also an overkill, it does not add any value, just takes it away.\n\nThe browsers say with the `Accept` header, please bring us something in these format, but anything is also fine with us.\n\nMy test takes a real world use of the `Accept` header and most of the versions **CouchDB** fail it which is really bad.\n\n## There are three options:\n-  Keep the patch like it is\n-  Update the patch with stricter matching for the full `application/json` and `text/html`, which is in the comments.\n-  Update the patch to select the quality of the matching, so to return the one the the client prefers, this is the most correct solution and I'll make a patch that implements this, if you choose so.\n\nI'll also make patches for **chttp** for the two latter options if you choose that.\n\nhttp://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/content-negotiation/\nhttp://shiflett.org/blog/2011/may/the-accept-header\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-network/1.0/content/Request_Response_Types.html\nhttps://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2/issues/712\nhttp://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/browser-rest-http-accept-headers\nhttps://www.npmjs.org/package/contenttype //The _q-value_, if any, is ignored.\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/negotiator/1.0.0 //possibly a better way of doing it but I don't thing for this usecase needed\nhttp://blog.bigbinary.com/2010/11/23/mime-type-resolution-in-rails.html\nhttps://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/tutorial/conneg.html\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19776-01/820-4867/ghrpv/\nhttp://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojolicious/Types.txt\nhttps://parse.com/docs/js/symbols/express.Request.html\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/64901623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/64903708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/284#issuecomment-64903708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/284","id":64903708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTAzNzA4","user":{"login":"olafura","id":292662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjY2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura","html_url":"https://github.com/olafura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olafura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-28T15:16:41Z","updated_at":"2014-11-28T15:16:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kxepal Sorry I haven't yet learned the structure on how you do things, the only reason I submitted a pull request is that I saw that you were ok with that.
