I’m not sure that Relay will ever encounter mypy types at _runtime_, but I may be missing something.\r\n\r\nThe Relay IR nodes (including types) are mirrored in Python via the TVM FFI, allowing us to construct Relay programs in Python. As a side effect, mypy can correctly handle some Relay types; however, it won’t be able to handle more complicated types like tensors. PEP 484 included @no_type_check_decorator, which allows us to disable mypy type checking for code annotated with the relay decorators.

Sorry for being absent the last couple of days, right after I shipped the initial version of the PR I had to move apartments and have been hastily moving things from one apartment to the next and trying to get my desk set back up so I could work 😄.\r\n\r\nI want to address a bunch of the feedback in order.\r\n\r\n# Typing dynamic dimensions\r\nThis is referring to @zheng-da, @tqchen and @junrushao1994's line of questions and discussions.\r\n\r\nThe type system design is general enough to support writing the functions you. For example we can write down a functions like: `(n, s, k) -> (s + 1, k * n)` (where `n`, `s` and `k` are symbolic) the problem is if we want to compile that function ahead of time without knowing `n`, `s`, and `k`. We need to generate code which works over arbitrary dimensions. In the current system we can still write such code we just rely on knowing `n`, `s`, and `k` at compile time.\r\n\r\nFortunately in deep learning many input dimensions are known at compile time allowing us to efficiently compile that code today.\r\n\r\nThe bigger issue is typing a loop which applies that function an unknown number of times. If you can convert the code to functional form like @junrushao1994 suggested then its possible to assign a symbolic relationship between the loop condition and the type. Realistically many of these need to be dynamic and require us to introduce a concept of an unknown dimension (which we do not currently support) and makes code generation significantly more complex if we want efficient kernels. \r\n\r\n# Graph Extraction from Relay\r\n\r\nIt is straight forward enough to extract a graph from Relay, I'm working on porting the Relay to TVM compiler to the newest version of Relay on the currently open PR. For example in the pure data flow case you would only accept `Let` and `Call` nodes, a program containing anything else would be rejected (this is roughly a basic block). I think extraction of graphs would be relatively easy to setup, and ideally the next generation runtime would allow us to generate and schedule code like this.\r\n\r\n# ONNX as IR and interchange format\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion about ONNX and a unified interchange format but the problem is that ONNX is insufficiently expressive. For example PyTorch can't export dynamic graphs of any form due to ONNX limitations. There are also issues like full support for broadcasting operations in the IR.\r\n\r\n# Data Structures\r\n\r\nI think data structures are interesting if we could assign them semantics ourselves I think optimization of them will be much easier, for example if we use data structures in a linear\r\nfashion it is possible to heavily fuse/elide allocations. I think we should follow up on this \r\nafter the initial IR lands. \r\n\r\n# On Optimizations\r\n\r\nIn terms of doing lower level optimizations my vision has always been that most users will interact with the IR before the \"suffix\" optimizations are applied. That is the user's perception will be of a high level functional graph, mostly free of effects, and can be reasoned about algebraically like most computation graphs. The \"suffix\" phases will do things like concretize the operators, do memory planning, convert from functional operations to destructive ones, etc. and then we will generate low level VM instructions/LLVM and a set of customized TVM operators. This is the place where we could break the uniform constant representation and schedule scalar code differently, etc.\r\n\r\n# Data Layout \r\n@kevinthesun We have talked about extending typing with data layout but it wasn't clear how to insert it into the type system. Last time @tqchen and I talked we were planning on storing it as an attribute. My thought was to have a layout pass which inserts explicit layout change operators everywhere and then tries to minimize the number of layout transforms, could imagine employing some search here, for example maybe its good to keep some data around in both layouts? would be interested in hearing more.\r\n\r\n# Pass Manger \r\n@zhiics The older version of Relay had a basic version of the pass manager. I think one really interesting use case for it is learning pass ordering. Pass ordering traditionally in compilers has been something that is relatively fixed, can have substantial impact on performance, and the optimal ordering is often application specific. I think having the ability to apply auto-tvm style techniques here would be great, especially as the number of passes grow. \r\n\r\n# Auto-batching\r\n\r\nWe have discussed implementing auto-batching as a compiler transform, but in general it sounds like a mixture of scheduling and program transform makes sense. It seems like there are many examples of this static/dynamic split in CS and especially compilers. One simple example is stack-frame/stack, we can simply compute the amount of storage for a single frame but in order to support recursion we allow some of the work to happen dynamically. We have discussed a similar strategy for the runtime, and I could imagine trying to heavily optimize static sub-graphs where possible and then bucket then dynamically during runtime. I'm not an expert in auto-batching so I would love to hear more ideas from the community.\r\n\r\n# MyPy and Relay\r\n\r\n@joshpoll is right about the type annotations we have setup them up to not interfere with MyPy, if MyPy gained support to type numpy computations we could probably design annotations which work both in MyPy and Relay. The previous version of Relay (not the one in the PR) had the required stubs to make everything work.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/418525265/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/418530198","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1671#issuecomment-418530198","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1671","id":418530198,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODUzMDE5OA==","user":{"login":"were","id":2356965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2356965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/were","html_url":"https://github.com/were","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T21:52:18Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T21:52:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/418530198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/418531128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1628#issuecomment-418531128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1628","id":418531128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODUzMTEyOA==","user":{"login":"yuruofeifei","id":3958379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3958379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei","html_url":"https://github.com/yuruofeifei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuruofeifei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T21:56:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T21:56:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated PR, @nishi-t @yzhliu \r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/418531128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/418532396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1673#issuecomment-418532396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1673","id":418532396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODUzMjM5Ng==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T22:01:31Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T22:01:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jroesch Thanks for the summary.

TL;DR IMHO maybe passes of one kind do not need pass managers, but passes of other kind should have one.\r\n\r\nI think (an obvious thing) that absence of pass manager may lead to hardly-detectable bugs during compiler development. I also think it is correct to separate passes which do actually change IR but do preserve the algorithm (typechecking of all sorts, may be loop unrolling) and passes which keep IR the same but change the program written in it (the ones which removes or inserts function calls, like fusing).\r\n\r\nThe passes which change IR but preserve the algorithm may really benefit from some kind of pass manager, better static than dynamic. I imagine, that In C++ this may be done by template metaprogramming on AST classes. In Haskell there are solutions employing fixed-point datatypes able attach or remove pass-specific details to AST datatype while keeping it statically-typed.  Dynamic pass managers are simpler but should already make life easier, so it may be a compromise solution.\r\n\r\nThe passes which change algorithm but preserve IR should be the playground of autotuning. I don't have  experience here, need to better learn this area. Maybe one should think of something like first-class passes, if it is ever possible. Generally, I believe that one should avoid playing with optimizations which can't be represented with a language because of troubles with formal verification in future.

For the runtime, I am little concerned about the testing if we want to have it in a separate PR because it seems to me that it requires the compiled binary for heterogeneous execution. Or I can have it first and then put more unit tests together with the compiler PR. Another option is that we can have two separate APIs for the compiler (build) for now, but having another PR to combine them together. I would probably prefer the latter so we can have a full test. How do you think? \r\n\r\nDon't worry, I removed the changes in dlpack. This PR shows some changes in dlpack is because I pull the master which is one commit ahead the one used in the TVM project.

It makes sense to combine efforts if possible to facilitate this process as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn terms of tasks needed to support a new FPGA platforms here are the high-level bits:\r\n\r\n- Porting the IP source from Xilinx HLS to Altera HLS/OpenCL with the Altera specific pragmas\r\n- Implementing test functions for those IP cores\r\n- Implementing a system integration .tcl script that wires those IP cores together to form a complete FPGA design (here we'd use Avalon-based system integration)\r\n- Implement a set of driver utilities that allow for\r\n   - contiguous memory allocation and de-allocation, with functions to obtain physical address of the allocated buffer (assuming shared memory system)\r\n   - functions to read/write to memory-mapped registers for accessing control registers of IP blocks\r\n   - function to program the bitstream on the FPGA\r\n\r\nThis should be enough to run a TVM benchmark that targets an Intel FPGA. Essentially we could subdivide this into (1) Altera HLS port, (2) IP integration with Avalon, and (3) software driver stack.\r\n\r\nAre there tasks that you consider to be already mostly completed on your end @liangfu ? I will be ordering a de10-nano to reproduce and validate your results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419606742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/419610610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1690#issuecomment-419610610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1690","id":419610610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxOTYxMDYxMA==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-08T03:59:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-08T03:59:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.

Because this problem seems to be a classical programming problem, I think we can also leverage some existing solvers. This can help the current \"too large space\" case.
