If you want the number of tuples pending in the queue, it is harder, because conceptually it does not fit well: tuples are packed into packets before putting into the queue, there are no longer tuples in concept at the lower level, so harder to count the number of tuples leaving the queue.

This was needed, thanks !\r\n\r\nI find the `runtime` config object management confusing too. It is slightly related to this change, but could be addressed in a different PR. Currently two config objects are used in most components. My understanding is that the initial instance of config object will be built/loaded by the `ConfigConfig` class. The other instance, `runtime`, would be loaded by the `*Main` classes. If this is correct, should we remove any `runtime` specific keys from `ConfigKeys` and `keys.yaml`? For e.g. `COMPONENT_RAMMAP`. The user will never provide these values. Adding these strings to `keys.yaml` seems unnecessary and may become confusing later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/277044393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/277052842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1689#issuecomment-277052842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1689","id":277052842,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzA1Mjg0Mg==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T19:12:07Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T19:12:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reviews.

Shall we do something like:\r\n````\r\ntask_id, component name, container id, CPU, RAM, Disk\r\n````\r\n\r\nSo, for the following table format:\r\n```\r\nContainer 1\r\nCPU: 5.0, RAM: 11GB, Disk: 5GB\r\n====================================================\r\n| component | task ID | CPU | RAM (GB) | disk (GB) |\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n|  exclaim1 |       1 | 1.0 |        3 |         1 |\r\n...\r\n====================================================\r\n```\r\n\r\nCSV output (excluding the header) should be something like:\r\n```\r\n1, exclaim1, 1, 1, 3, 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is kind of shitty and there should be a better design. Any idea? @billonahill

Consumers can toggle a config object back and forth with the `Config.toLocalMode(config)` and `Config.toRemoteMode(config)` methods as needed. Those methods return new cached config instances instead of mutating the one passed.\r\n\r\nAn example can be seen in how `AuroraScheduler` uses remote for setting the properties in `heron.aurora` (which is used on the server) but uses local for the heron config dir required to get the local path to `heron.aurora` used by the aurora CLI call.\r\n\r\nAlso note this PR has some duplicate unit test changes from #1704.
