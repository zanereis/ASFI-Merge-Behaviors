The server may have been stopped and then\t         \r\n// immediately restarted, which sometimes results in a bind exception\t       \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes me a bit nervous about bypassing that logic in a GatewayReceiverImpl context, since it is just a subclass of CacheServerImpl and may be subject to the same issue of encountering bind exceptions on server restart.\r\n\r\nI'd vote we remove the changes I suggested in AcceptorImpl after looking at this more closely.
