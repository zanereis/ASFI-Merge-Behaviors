this feature is still here in the proposed approach, and the logic of \"multiple runs\" is not changed. To prevent situation when one or several expensive queries take _all_ available off-heap memory, dynamic constraints could be added, like no query could receive more memory, than current amount of free off-heap memory, divided by the current number of idle processing threads. In the worst case it would always divide resources as fair as the current approach (when all queries are equally expensive), but if cheaper queries are run in parallel with more expensive queries, it would allow for expensive queries to allocate more memory, while cheaper queries are not hurt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309556971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/309558288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3663#issuecomment-309558288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3663","id":309558288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTU1ODI4OA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-19T20:05:59Z","updated_at":"2017-06-19T20:05:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jon-wei

a lot for your suggestions @drcrallen .  With your input and my practice,  I came up with the solution below.\r\n\r\nDruid roles can be categorized into 2 different groups:\r\n* **Controller**: coordinator/middleManager  --  limited workers for each controller role for one cluster. \r\n* **Worker**: broker/historical  -- large number of workers is needed for one cluster with hundreds of machines\r\n\r\nSo on first stage of druid on yarn project, I only take worker role (broker/historical) into consideration.\r\n\r\nDetails as below:\r\n\r\n![druidonyarnarchitecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16383228/27428940-28e18136-5776-11e7-8459-19758d584af8.png)\r\n\r\nOne application master for each module.\r\n1. Druid client send request to yarn resource manager to start up  app master\r\n2. Yarn resource manager start the app master\r\n3. App manager ask resource for broker/historical according to certain strategies\r\n4. ResourceManager return the resource and app manager will get connection with those node manager\r\n5. App manager ask related node manager to start broker/historical\r\n6. broker/historical register themselves into zookeeper after startup for failover senerio\r\n7. App manager watch the related zookeeper path.  If any broker/historical fails due to OOM or other exception, app manager will try to restart it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Druid has its constrains as a distributed system.\r\n**Broker**  \r\n1.  Users need to connect to brokers to query druid.  So broker ip and port are exposed to either VIP or user directly.  So broker ip and port can't be changed.\r\n2.  If use VIP as load balancer,  all broker would have to start on the same port.  Thus only one worker can be started per node.\r\n\r\n**Historical**  \r\n1. Historical works as local cache for data.   It takes some time to download data from HDFS to local disk.  So it's better to restart historical on the same node when failover.\r\n2. Currently, all historical use the same dir to store data.  So only one historical can be started per node.\r\n\r\nDue to above reasons, druid is not a normal distributed systems.  The druid application manager needs to be able to support at least 2 worker distribution strategies:\r\n1. Exclusive -- one broker/historical per node\r\n2. Normal -- workers can be distributed on any node with enough resource\r\n\r\nOn first stage,  I'll focus on the exclusive strategy.  The second one needs more druid code modification.  And also,  for failover strategy,  workers will be start up at the same node before it dead abnormally.\r\n\r\nFrom long term,  druid broker and historical should be able to support the normal strategy.  And the solutions to this problems are quiet easy.\r\n\r\n![druidonyarn-broker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16383228/27428904-07f18b56-5776-11e7-999e-690fafa5adbb.png)\r\n\r\n*  For brokers, use a proxy to distribute the querys\r\n*  For historical,  app manager will asign a data dir for each historical.\r\n\r\nPerhaps above functions would be done in stage two.  \r\n\r\n Let me know if you have any questions or ideas.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/310353347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/310375192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4441#issuecomment-310375192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4441","id":310375192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDM3NTE5Mg==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T13:10:02Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T13:10:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/310375192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/310390485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4400#issuecomment-310390485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4400","id":310390485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDM5MDQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T14:06:06Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T14:06:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RongZhang828 This is great proposal !\r\nI would like to note that middleManager can be a worker as well.
