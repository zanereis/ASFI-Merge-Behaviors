In that change, there is a code path that is not tested, which is counting positional deletes when using a streaming delete filter. I manually tested that code path by temporarily changing the threshold to use a streaming filter in `DeleteFilter` from 100,000 to 2 and running `TestSparkReaderDeletes` that way. With this change, we make the threshold configurable so we can set it for testing. I had actually introduced the change here in the original PR at some point, but Russell asked me to separate it out because the PR was already quite complex.\r\n\r\nThe logic behind this change is as follows:\r\nWe add a `streamDeleteFilterThreshold` field to `SparkScan.ReadTask`, because the `planInputPartitions` method of both `SparkBatch` and `SparkMicroBatchStream` construct `SparkScan.ReadTask`s, and `SparkBatch` and `SparkMicroBatchStream` both take a `SparkReadConf` and thus can get the threshold value from the `SparkReadConf` and pass it in when constructing `SparkScan.ReadTask`. `SparkScan.RowReader` and `SparkScan.BatchReader` both take a `SparkScan.ReadTask` in their constructor, so they can get the threshold from `SparkScan.ReadTask` and pass it up their constructor chain to their respective superclasses, `RowDataReader` and `BatchDataReader`, where in their `open(FileScanTask)` methods, they construct a `BaseReader.SparkDeleteFilter`, which is where we pass in the threshold value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1244528824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1244637851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5737#issuecomment-1244637851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5737","id":1244637851,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KL6qb","user":{"login":"danielcweeks","id":4925077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4925077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T22:40:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T22:40:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> LGTM, should we add a test for this?\r\n\r\nGood idea.

seems to be an issue of [trino-iceberg plugin](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/385/plugin/trino-iceberg/src/main/java/io/trino/plugin/iceberg/catalog/hms/HiveMetastoreTableOperations.java#L92-L98), which throws `CommitFailedException` on an inappropriate occasion.\r\n\r\nCommit of transactions takes roughly 2 steps:\r\n\r\n1. Write metadata of the new snapshot to file storage;\r\n2. Update the catalog to point to the location of the new metadata. This is the step where `CommitFailedException` could be thrown after the snapshot is persisted to file storage.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about whether we can roll back step 1 when step 2 fails. Step 2 can fail in many ways, in some cases we are pretty sure that the update must have failed, and the metadata location of the table should remain unchanged after failure. Example of such failures are `CommitFailedException` and `org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.AlreadyExistsException`. In this case we can safely roll back step 1.\r\n\r\nFor most types of failures, we don't know if the catalog was actually updated or not, such as the `java.net.SocketTimeoutException` mentioned in this issue. We should not blindly rollback step 1 in this case. The hive metastore catalog implementation in iceberg [does a second check](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/0.14.x/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/BaseMetastoreTableOperations.java#L278-L288) when unexpected exception was raised during metastore update.\r\n\r\nTo my mere understanding, `CommitFailedException` in iceberg indicates a known commit failure, where the catalog was guaranteed to be left unmodified (thrown in metadata consistency validation process most of the time). It should not be thrown in case of socket errors when updating hive metadata.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1244864514/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1245042725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5732#issuecomment-1245042725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5732","id":1245042725,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KNdgl","user":{"login":"KarlManong","id":2627662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Mjc2NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2627662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong","html_url":"https://github.com/KarlManong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarlManong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-13T08:00:29Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T08:00:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

My test calls `expire_snapshots` in a loop and out of let's say 10 runs, I'll get 1 or more failures, which means that the manifest files are valid and the problem occurs \"randomly\".\r\n2. My Iceberg tables are stored in Azure datalake (gen2, DFS) and Spark is using the hadoop-azure package to read/write from the datalake.  I had a good look at the hadoop-azure code and they do pre-fetching (or lookaheads) for files using multi-threading.  To me, this looks suspicious for my issue and what appears to be a random issue could very well be related to a concurrency problem.\r\n3. I was able to prove that moving to Spark 3.3.0 (from 3.2.1) and Iceberg 0.14 caused the problem since I can run my test just fine (85 consecutive successful runs) using the previous Spark build (3.2.1-0.13.1), against the same table/same files.  As soon as I switch to the new build, the error occurs within a few runs.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is related to hadoop-azure and NOT iceberg, but I have yet to prove it.  The Spark upgrade to 3.3.0 includes an upgrade of the hadoop-azure library (from 3.3.1 to 3.3.2) and some modifications to the prefetch code was done during the 3.3.2 release.  I have yet to go through all those changes, I was hoping I could isolate and reproduce the problem without using Spark, by only using the pure Java API).  Which brings me to the following question:\r\n\r\n- When calling [Table.expireSnapshots()](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/0f0b1af2ebbc5693ff6dc8049a1e3490540311f8/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/BaseTable.java#L213), I have realized that not a single Avro file is being read from the datalake.  But when the same [Spark action](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/0f0b1af2ebbc5693ff6dc8049a1e3490540311f8/spark/v3.3/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/actions/ExpireSnapshotsSparkAction.java#L49-L63) is being called, all the Avro manifest files are being read and this is where the problem happens.  Don't get me wrong, reading the manifests should not trigger a problem, but I'd like to understand why the Spark implementation is different from the pure Java one?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1248037880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1248099574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5632#issuecomment-1248099574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5632","id":1248099574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KZHz2","user":{"login":"zinking","id":118241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODI0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking","html_url":"https://github.com/zinking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-15T13:25:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T13:25:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue

@chenjunjiedada for bringing it up. It is good to have the statistic(min seq. number) for delete files, which will make rewrite a bit easier. I don't have much context though. One use case in my mind is that, we cannot easily remove the delete files while compaction since we don't know if it still refers to any data files within a partition, the min seq number will make it a bit easier. \r\n\r\nThink aloud and come up another way to have the statistics. We can persist the `seq#` to the delete files, the new schema for position deletes will be `(file_path, pos, seq)`. We can get the min/max of the column `seq`. It requires more storage for each delete files, but less table spec changes. One of good things is that we can have the `max` for the `seq`, which also helps for deleting a delete files. For example, we can delete the delete-files whose max seq less than the `seq#` of any data files.\r\nHere is an example, assume we have this sequence happens in multiple snapshots\r\n```\r\ndataFile1 -> deleteFile1 -> dataFile2 -> deleteFile2 -> dataFile3\r\n```\r\nWith the max seq#, we can remove deleteFile1 once dataFile1 has gone, and remove deleteFile2 once dataFile2 and dataFile1 have gone.\r\n\r\nI don't favor any solution though.

There are 2 cases I can think of that should be handled in createView. \r\n\r\nCreateView can either:\r\n\r\n1.) Create a completely new view with an initial set of representations for the view. i.e. the view is not even defined in the catalog \r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n2.) Add new representation(s) to an existing view if and only if the new representations or sql dialects don't already exist in the current view (if they exist this means that a user must replace the view). This case should still increment the view version. \r\n\r\nThis could be a separate API AddViewRepresentation but this puts more work on a caller to identify if a given view representation or dialect already exists in a view which does not seem like the right behavior. \r\n\r\n## Schema Validation of different representations\r\n\r\nThere's another issue here for if and how does CreateView validate that the representations all have the expected schema for case 2? Considering a view represents a result of a computation there must be a single schema. Following this, ideally CreateView should validate that the schema is the same for the representations. \r\n\r\nThis is challenging considering different representations and SQL dialects. In the long run, I think projects like Coral or Substrait would be used to help perform the schema validation across the different SQL dialects. As an extension, even there could be a Substrait View Representation down the line. \r\n\r\n@wmoustafa @jacques-n Any recommendations on a good way for handling this schema validation within the view format itself? I'm taking a look in Coral and Substrait (apologies if this is a naive question)\r\n\r\nFor addressing schema validation in the short term, I think in createView API engines should pass in the schema for the dialects. Then createView performs a validation that the passed in schema aligns with the view schema. This could be bypassed by an engine just passing in the view.schema() even though it doesn't actually align with the view definition but I think that handling that case isn't required now.\r\n\r\nHappy to get thoughts and suggestions on this! @jzhuge @danielcweek  @jackye1995 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1250178504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1250352801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5785#issuecomment-1250352801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5785","id":1250352801,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Kht6h","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-18T17:29:20Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T17:29:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging to avoid having this run during the week 👍🏻 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1250352801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1250485527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5569#issuecomment-1250485527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5569","id":1250485527,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KiOUX","user":{"login":"JonasJ-ap","id":55990951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTkwOTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55990951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap","html_url":"https://github.com/JonasJ-ap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonasJ-ap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-19T02:38:29Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T02:38:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi.
