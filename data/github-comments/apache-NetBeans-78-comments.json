specially by maven. They are distributed via different repositories and follow different rules (have a look at the \"real\" artifact versions of snapshots after upload), so I assume that sonatype (or the nexus instance of apache) block artifacts with \"-SNAPSHOT\" versions and/or dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe artifact for the dependency is already packaged on maven central. To do that, I had a look at the artifact @jlahoda created and replicated the work based on his.

The Windows launcher is the same launcher used in the zip bundles, and thus daily builds, betas, etc.  It's having two methods of launching on macOS, both requiring updates and testing, one of which more likely to be used by devs, one by users, and which we're not (at the moment) in a good position to test.\r\n\r\nThis looks a good change to me, and I like passing in the dock name as an environment variable.  That actually covers one use I've had in platform apps for forking the launch script.\r\n\r\nIn the original PR you mentioned using Apple APIs to look up userdir and cache locations.
