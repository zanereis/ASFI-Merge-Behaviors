Also, from a auditing perspective, it is hard to track which code has been executed, since it hasn't been commited to version control.\r\n- Compatibility with the different executors. This will only work for the {Local,Sequential}executor, since the Celery and Kubernetes have the Airflow dags distributed.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can integrate git-hooks in Airflow.
