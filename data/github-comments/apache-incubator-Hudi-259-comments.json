No.of messages in kafka and no.of records in Athena, matched.\r\n2. Sent a batch of another 100 records to Kafka -> Compaction -> no.of msgs in kafka = no.of records in Athena.\r\n3. Sent a batch of another 100 records (here there were some duplicates ) -> Compaction -> no.of.msgs in Kafka = no. of records in Athena.\r\n4. Sent another batch 98 records (some were duplicates) -> compaction -> no.of messages != no.of records in Athena.  There were no more files to be compacted. About 24 records were missing.\r\n5.  Sent another 100 records. -> compaction -> record count did not match. there was same 24 missing. \r\n\r\nMore or less, I followed the above steps several times before I raised the issue here.

This normally works on Athena because the default method to map the columns on Athena is using the names [1], for Presto the default way is by column indexes [2], so when you have schema evolution or for some reason the order of columns doesn't match between the parquet files and the table schema, this starts to happen, nothing related to hudi itself.\r\n\r\nTo fix this add the config `hive.parquet.use-column-names=true` under the EMR config tab or at start up time, this is going to update the config files and restart the presto cluster.  If you want to do this on a running cluster you'll need to do on master and worker nodes and restart presto, without doing that the config won't work.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this helps 😁 \r\n\r\n[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/handling-schema-updates-chapter.html\r\n[2] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60183579/presto-fails-with-type-mismatch-errors","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1199808432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1199914603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6232#issuecomment-1199914603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6232","id":1199914603,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5HhT5r","user":{"login":"neerajpadarthi","id":42651065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjUxMDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42651065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi","html_url":"https://github.com/neerajpadarthi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neerajpadarthi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T20:17:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T20:17:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yihua \r\n\r\nHey, I have verified the same in Hudi 0.10.1 but no luck still precision is getting truncated.
