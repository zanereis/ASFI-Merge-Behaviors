So we'll end up having two Kryo versions in our classpath.\nSo if we want to upgrade Kryo, we need to do it explicitly, to avoid having two Kryo versions in our classpath.\n\nAnother issue we need to consider is the serialization compatibility. Savepoints in Flink could potentially contain data serialized with Kryo 2.24. If we want to provide savepoint compatibility between Flink 1.1 and 1.2, we need to consider that.\nAccording to the Kryo documentation, 2.24 to 3.0.0 is serialization compatible (I hope the same holds true for chill): https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/blob/master/CHANGES.md#2240---300-2014-10-04\nI would like to hear @StephanEwen and @uce's opinion on this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/253216276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/253219105","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2439#issuecomment-253219105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2439","id":253219105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzIxOTEwNQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T13:51:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T13:51:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, then we should re-add all the dependency exclusions that were removed from the `flink-storm/pom.xml`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/253219105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/253220552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2623#issuecomment-253220552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2623","id":253220552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzIyMDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T13:56:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T13:56:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As far as I read it, Kryo 3.x is not strictly serialization compatible with 2.x, hence the major version number bump.\n\nIf the interfaces are still stable, then it should be fine to bump the chill dependency version, exclude any kryo dependency, and add our own 2.x kryo dependency.

That would sound more explicit like \"cleanup\" and actual file deletion.\n- Since all checkpoints are persistent (at least in HA), how about calling this `enableExternalizedCheckpoints()` rather than `enablePersistentCheckpoints()`?\n- I would suggest to drop the method `enablePersistentCheckpoints()` without a cleanup policy parameter. Whoever enables that feature should explicitly think about what cleanup policy they want.\n\nFor the future, can we get rid of the extra storage location for the externalized checkpoint metadata? Simply store it as well in the checkpoint directory? That makes it simpler for users to track and clean up checkpoints manually, if they want to retain externalized checkpoints across cancellations and terminal failures.\n- Both the config value and the location parameter to the `enablePersistentCheckpoints()` would be dropped.\n- That would imply that every state backend needs to be able to provide a storage location for the checkpoint metadata\n- The memory state backend would hence not work with externalized checkpoints, unless one sets explicitly a parameter `setExternalizedCheckpointsLocation(uri)`.`\n\nSince this is a bigger change, I would suggest a followup pull request for that. The only change I would make to this pull request (to make transition to the followup smoother) is to remove the path parameter from the `enablePersistentCheckpoints()` methods and always use the configuration value (which will be replaced by the state backend's storage location).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/253246044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/253296449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2288#issuecomment-253296449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2288","id":253296449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzI5NjQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T18:25:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T18:25:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cresny Do you want to continue on this?
