In current implementation, I just use union function, which means all operations can be in one stage without shuffle.\r\n\r\nI mean when users want to use the new table form, there will be no wide row which contains all time series at all. Therefore, we do not need to split a wide row into several narrow rows.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example: suppose the file schema has \"s1, s2, s3\"\r\n\r\nIn DefaultSource.inferSchema(), we return the \"timestamp, deviceId, s1, s2, s3\" to spark to generate the new table form.\r\n\r\nIn DefaultSource.buildReader(), the required schema is \"timestamp, deviceId, s1, s2, s3\", suppose the PartitionedFile has one chunk group (device1, s1, s2, s3). Then, we could build a tsfile reader to query three time series : device1.s1, device1.s2, device1.s3 and directly construct the result to an InternalRow and return to Spark.\r\n\r\nThis step can be parallelized. Each executor in spark will read a partition of one tsfile. These executors could work independently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/515348571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/515379301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/300#issuecomment-515379301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/300","id":515379301,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTM3OTMwMQ==","user":{"login":"jt2594838","id":23610645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjEwNjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23610645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838","html_url":"https://github.com/jt2594838","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jt2594838/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T09:29:28Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T09:29:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/515379301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/515379621","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/300#issuecomment-515379621","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/300","id":515379621,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTM3OTYyMQ==","user":{"login":"JulianFeinauer","id":17098762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk4NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17098762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer","html_url":"https://github.com/JulianFeinauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianFeinauer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T09:30:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T09:30:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
