It should be noted that the update limit and delete limit statements do not support sharding route to multiple data nodes, because its result are incorrect, and currently only support sharding route to single data node.\r\n\r\nHi @strongduanmu , thanks.\r\nI've tested it again:\r\n- `update t_order set status = ? where order_id = ? or (user_id = ? and status='PAID') limit ?`, failed, notice `UPDATE ... LIMIT can not support sharding route to multiple data nodes.`\r\n- `update t_order set status = ? where order_id = ? limit ?`, works\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/678880876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/678881837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6985#issuecomment-678881837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6985","id":678881837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODg4MTgzNw==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T03:16:42Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T03:39:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xbkaishui @cenyu00 @sandynz \r\nThe closing date for all PRs is 2020.8.27.\r\nIt's a little urgent.

Considering the `data consistency`, IMO, there are two issues, i.e., `distributed transaction` for applications and `distributed storage` for there distributed databases themselves.\r\nFor the first one, `2PC` or `B.A.S.E` distributed transaction solutions are our concerns and developing currently.\r\nBut concerning the second one, if it is a distributed database `proxy or middleware`, then like MySQL replication between the master node and slave nodes can help a lot. On the other hand, if it is a real `distributed database`, then a distributed storage is supposed to come together accordingly. \r\nHowever, ShardingSphere is more like a distributed database `proxy or middleware ecosystem`. Hence I have to say we did a tradeoff between `data consistency` and `scalability and query efficiency`.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTrista","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/678890846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/678891564","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7014#issuecomment-678891564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7014","id":678891564,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODg5MTU2NA==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T04:02:43Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T04:02:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It makes sense to remove the error log.\r\n\r\nThis issue if good for beginners:\r\n\r\n`Remove the lines 84, 85 in FrontendChannelInboundHandler.java`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/678891564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/678891599","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7017#issuecomment-678891599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7017","id":678891599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODg5MTU5OQ==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T04:02:57Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T04:02:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @hongfuli Thanks for your issue.\r\nBesides, are you interested in raizing a PR to fix it?\r\nIf you worry about your modification, I think a unit test is expected in your PR as well.
