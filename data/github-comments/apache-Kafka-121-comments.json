The perf numbers might be a bit misleading. The test uses a bunch of threads. In that case you might get better performance for cases where you're mostly only reading from the ConcurrentHashmap (so it parallelizes well), and by writing to different topics you now actually get some benefit from the parallelism since they are using different counters.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, a single threaded version might not do as well. I modified the test to use just 1 thread (and more iterations to get a more stable number) and I see ~30% performance hit.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is just one part of what the producer does when enqueueing a message. I still think this might be a worthwhile fix, but just getting comparison perf numbers using producer performance might be more useful -- I really have no idea what fraction of the cost per-message can be attributed to partitioning (although I guess it's small). We don't necessarily need something that can be run on every commit, just some confirmation we're not going to take a significant hit for common use cases.\r\n\r\nAlso, current version is failing checkstyle in a couple of places in the test. The clients tests run quickly, so even if you leave the rest of the tests to Jenkins, you might want to run `./gradlew clients:test` before pushing an update to make sure it'll pass the checkstyle tests as well as unit tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/269379012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/269454988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2294#issuecomment-269454988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2294","id":269454988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTQ1NDk4OA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-28T10:01:59Z","updated_at":"2016-12-28T10:01:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Select a fixed set of options and commit to working on optimizing the implementation of those options if it turns out to be necessary (e.g. if built-in implementation isn't very fast). This might be a good option if you don't expect users to need to change this commonly, e.g. only because some old hash algorithm is being retired. In this case we want to try to keep the options to a minimum since there are very specific reasons for making a change and fewer options makes it easier for the user. For example, @ijuma already raised MD2, but do we really need all of SHA-1, 256, 384, and 512? What's the benefit of adding each of these? I don't think any of these impose a big maintenance burden on us, but they do make things a bit more complicated for users.\r\n\r\n2. Make things pluggable via an interface (like serializers, partitioners, etc) and provide at least one sane default. It's trivial for users to implement their own if they need something else. This is a good option if we have multiple reasons users might want to swap out implementations: they want a really optimized native implementation, they are ok with cheaper, less effective hash functions in favor of speed, they want to be able to rotate them out as hash functions are retired, they want to use hash functions we wouldn't want to pull libraries in for (or implement ourselves), etc.\r\n\r\nI'm ok with either one of these, but I was mentioning the KIP because clarifying the motivation would help us choose between these 2 options and in the case of (1), help us figure out which options we want to expose.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/269694786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/269694921","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1661#issuecomment-269694921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1661","id":269694921,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTY5NDkyMQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-29T21:17:49Z","updated_at":"2016-12-29T21:17:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

`connect-standalone` settings as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/269701690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/269704645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2295#issuecomment-269704645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2295","id":269704645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTcwNDY0NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-29T22:39:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-29T22:39:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

If the corresponding streams' consumer group contains a committed offset for that topic, then we should ALWAYS restart from that committed offset.\r\n\r\n2. If no committed offset, then check if the topic is involved in a source stream where a reset policy is explicitly set in the builder API calls, if yes we should honor that configured value.\r\n\r\n3. Otherwise, we will fall back to the consumer's global config of AUTO_RESET_POLICY.\r\n\r\nAnd to follow this priority, one possible implementation is (just as an example):\r\n\r\n1. In the stream thread, in the onPartitionAssigned callback, use `committed()` to check if it has committed offset, if yes simply continue as consumer will auto-reset to that committed position.\r\n\r\n2. Otherwise check if this topic has an explicit reset policy, if yes use `seekTo..` to seek to the corresponding position;\r\n\r\n3. If no reset policy is set, the simply continue since then it will rely on the consumer's global config to reset.\r\n\r\nIn this case we do not need to require the consumer's config to be set to `none`.

I think @ijuma is getting at the fact that Hamcrest is probably more useful for replacing some assertions that aren't related to messages -- probably the extent of asserting things about messages that I'd expect is to include important parameters like timeout values, not very specific strings for the messages.\r\n\r\nA more realistic use that could be used as a test is to replace some `assertEquals`, `assertNull`, and `assertNotNull` with `assertThat`s using Hamcrest matchers. These are probably our most commonly used assertions.
