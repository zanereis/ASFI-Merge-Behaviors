It was more of a feasibility test than a real test.   Macros require a separate package so you need a 2 phase compile.  Using scala-logging might be a better option.\n\nIt's not urgent, obviously nobody is blocked by it, but at some point we should revisit this.  Some of our profile data was showing up to 6% of the time was spent on logging, but most of it is probably on these short lived classes and they way they instantiate logging (which this patch tries to work towards).

It's not clear to me that we do this safely without some restructuring (and rethinking). The difficulty is that we can make several calls to the purgatories while holding the lock and we seem to depend on the state of the group not changing in between calls. I don't know how we can reacquire the lock after releasing it unless we revalidate the current state of the group, which will make the patch fairly complicated. Maybe Onur could look and see whether there's an easier way, but I'm doubtful.\n\nOne alternative I was thinking about is whether we could use a different implementation of `Watchers` for the GroupCoordinator purgatories. For example, we could keep the old version as `Watchers`, and we could let the one included in this patch be `LockSafeWatchers` or something like that. What do you think?\n\nFor now, I've rebased the current patch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253058878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253087330","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1738#issuecomment-253087330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1738","id":253087330,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzA4NzMzMA==","user":{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T00:40:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T00:40:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji : Thanks for the patch.

And if there is a single message in the message set, that means that there is nothing left to write (`compressMessages` is a no-op in that case).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253495766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253528169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2023#issuecomment-253528169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2023","id":253528169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzUyODE2OQ==","user":{"login":"fxsever","id":6420436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjA0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6420436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever","html_url":"https://github.com/fxsever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fxsever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T14:23:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T14:23:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Great improvement for huge clusters!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253528169/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253571629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2019#issuecomment-253571629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2019","id":253571629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzU3MTYyOQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T16:52:14Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T16:52:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've updated the PR to avoid the message conversion entirely.

for discovering the bug. In the case when we write a malformed message whose wrapper magic is different from the inner one, the impact seems to be the following: (1) the log cleaner will fail when it tries to read that message back since we validate the magic version btw inner and wrapper message in ByteBufferMessageSet.deepIterator(). (2) The old consumer will hit the same issue if it tries to read this malformed message. (3) It's not clear what happens to the new consumer since it doesn't seem that we validate the magic version btw inner and wrapper in MemoryRecords.\n\nNow, on when this can be triggered. If this is the offset topic, since the consumer typically commits offsets for all assigned partitions together, chances are all messages in a compressed set will either be all cleaned and none will be cleaned. So, we we probably won't hit this case. KStream may use compacted topics. However, it's only available since 0.10, which uses magic version 1 already. So, it won't hit this issue either. So, the question is \"are there any other common usage of compacted topic that can hit this issue\".\n\n@becketqin : Have you guys seen this issue at LinkedIn?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253589366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253620166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2025#issuecomment-253620166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2025","id":253620166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzYyMDE2Ng==","user":{"login":"radai-rosenblatt","id":1042632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt","html_url":"https://github.com/radai-rosenblatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radai-rosenblatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T19:52:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T19:52:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The long-term correct solution to the bug is still a wire format change.\nHowever, shorter term this PR makes the code rely on InputStream.available() to detect EOF without catching an exception. this works because for this particular case the reads are all memory-backed (as opposed to directly from socket) and so all input is at hand - all that's required is careful implementation of available().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253620166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253626193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2024#issuecomment-253626193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2024","id":253626193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzYyNjE5Mw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-13T20:16:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T20:16:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
