I can explain to you with more details. The reason I called this a design issue, it is in old days(3.x series), we have no such a powerful UI, just topology. Then in order to visualize conjecture nodes(such as: MySQL, Kafka, which would be installed an agent), we put the client library names as the server name. \r\n\r\nFor example, we set component name of Kafka consumer as `Kafka`, only, which triggers the issue described in here. \r\n\r\nSo we have to change this, and put the real component names in agent, then do component->server-side mapping for the UI. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/pull/1266 , that includes all the changes for this issue. But sadly, today's travis-ci has some network issues... fails all the time... can't merge it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/392237380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/392266940","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1269#issuecomment-392266940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1269","id":392266940,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjI2Njk0MA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-26T15:00:50Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T15:00:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Undo.
