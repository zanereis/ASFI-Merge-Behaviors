The current implementation ```KubernetesSecretsTokenAuthProvider``` stores the name of the secret (pointer to it) in the data field of FunctionAuthData.  That is an workflow establish in ```KubernetesSecretsTokenAuthProvider``` because we cache the name via ```cacheAuthData``` in the function metadata topic.  How can we make that assumption for another FunctionAuthProvider impl?  I could have implemented another version of a Kubernetes Function Authentication Provider that puts the actual token in the data field of FunctionAuthData and set it explicitly as a env variable in the pod spec.  While that approach might not be secure, I would like implementations to have that flexibility and not to pigeon hole implementation to a certain workflow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/473393406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/473397683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3735#issuecomment-473397683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3735","id":473397683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM5NzY4Mw==","user":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T18:33:48Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T18:33:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng \r\n> I don't believe that is the correct design choice because now the runtime is making assumptions on what the data in FunctionAuthData is. \r\n\r\nWhat you are doing now in the case of KubernetesFunctionAuthProvider is premature generalization.

Something for vault with dynamic tokens (i think i figured out the workload for this btw) would need something very different. \r\n\r\nGeneralization for this interface doesn't make sense even. The AuthProvider interface is a way for the runtime to allow common rest code code to pass information to the common instance code. But between these two points, everything is k8s specific. So we should treat it as such.\r\n\r\n> The current implementation KubernetesSecretsTokenAuthProvider stores the name of the secret (pointer to it) in the data field of FunctionAuthData. That is an workflow establish in KubernetesSecretsTokenAuthProvider because we cache the name via cacheAuthData in the function metadata topic.

related.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/473563282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/473569430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3835#issuecomment-473569430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3835","id":473569430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzU2OTQzMA==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-16T17:48:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-16T17:48:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun
