Dave, the beginPos will change for each call of this method. It is the region index of the first region of a group of regions.\n If a table has 28 regions, and Trafodion decides to start 4 ESPs for this query, each ESP then needs to handle 7 regions. So the first ESP will be responsible for region 0 - 6, second 7- 13, etc... So the beginPos will be 0, 7, 14, 21 . I am not sure if hash will generate same value for this sequence?\nEven so, in fact, which regionserver is most popular for a given range, for example, 0 -7, it is already  random. This randomization is an attempt, if it doesn't work as we wish, it doesn't harm, and we can continue to design some new algorithm,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/186484935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/186493055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/333#issuecomment-186493055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/333","id":186493055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjQ5MzA1NQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-20T02:40:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-20T02:40:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

format tables\n\nFor a table having a column with current_timestamp, we had issues when this column was omitted in a upsert statement. It wouldn't put a cell with current timestamp into hbase table.Then, a wrong value for the timestamp is displayed when the row is selected. In addition, the raw hbase table would have cells for the omitted default value columns at times. It wasn’t consistent when the cell with default value is inserted into raw hbase table.\n\nWhen there is a omitted COM_CURRENT_DEFAULT column, the upsert is changed to merge always.  All other times it would be just upsert/insert.  All other default columns when it is not user specified is not written to hbase table. It is resolved at the time of select using the default values.\n\nAligned format:\nThere was corruption in the aligned format table row because the omitted columns with default values were not populated correctly.\n\nFix:\nBy default, upsert is always is changed to merge.  If the row doesn’t exist,  a new row is inserted with omitted  default values filled in.  If the row exists, the omitted columns are filled with old values.\n\nWith the cqd TRAF_UPSERT_WITH_INSERT_DEFAULT_SEMANTICS set to ON the omitted columns will always be filled with default values when upserted.\n\nYes, It is possible that I can use the above CQD to avoid merge in case of non-aligned format. But to ensure that we get the default value when this CQD is set to ON, we need to store the default values always when omitted. We wouldn’t be able to take advantage of the feature of skipping cells when omitted and still get the default value upon select without actually storing the data in hbase.  Hence the above CQD applies to aligned format alone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/189008840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/189009596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/340#issuecomment-189009596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/340","id":189009596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTAwOTU5Ng==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-25T22:18:11Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T22:18:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merge is an expensive operation than just upsert/insert.
