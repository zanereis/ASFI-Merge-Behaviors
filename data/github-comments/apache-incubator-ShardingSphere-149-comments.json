@291277058 Hi Thanks for your explanation and example. I guess you did a lot of work on this issue.\r\n> To value your work, I wanna catch your point. How to understand **shardingkey should not update value(not forbiden update in the sql,just forbiden update the value of the sharding key)**?\r\n> \r\n> If setting sharding key appears in the update items instead of where-condition like `set shardingID=xxx where 1=1`, is this SQL expected to be executed?\r\n\r\nYes,it should be execude, there is no reason to block sql commit, even canbe hanppened like want update shardingkey,but the value still route into the same table.So of cause expected to be executed.Deside execute or not should in the bessnies application.Not in base compoment,Shardingsphere should simple as it canbe.\r\n\r\nThanks for your kindness.This is a disscuess,it useful for me and my work is always be valueful for my self.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/683357827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/683358283","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146#issuecomment-683358283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7146","id":683358283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzM1ODI4Mw==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-30T00:28:35Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T00:28:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7146](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/commit/352f6961795e5d4aaf17bbf874775e1e0a244c0b?el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.00%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=ZvlXpWa7so)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #7146      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     75.58%   75.57%   -0.01%     \n  Complexity      469      469              \n============================================\n  Files          1219     1219              \n  Lines         21688    21688              \n  Branches       3930     3930              \n============================================\n- Hits          16392    16391       -1     \n  Misses         4271     4271              \n- Partials       1025     1026       +1     \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | Complexity Δ | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| [...re/scaling/core/schedule/ScalingTaskScheduler.java](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c2hhcmRpbmdzcGhlcmUtc2NhbGluZy9zaGFyZGluZ3NwaGVyZS1zY2FsaW5nLWNvcmUvc3JjL21haW4vamF2YS9vcmcvYXBhY2hlL3NoYXJkaW5nc3BoZXJlL3NjYWxpbmcvY29yZS9zY2hlZHVsZS9TY2FsaW5nVGFza1NjaGVkdWxlci5qYXZh) | `52.17% <0.00%> (-2.18%)` | `0.00% <0.00%> (ø%)` | |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/shardingsphere/pull/7146?src=pr&el=footer).
