With regard to  **logical_not** - it's not included in the PR because of that issue in the snap.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/573727010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/573733217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4694#issuecomment-573733217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4694","id":573733217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzczMzIxNw==","user":{"login":"kevinyuan","id":231197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T15:56:04Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T15:56:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @liangfu,\r\n\r\nWith your recommended changes, **tsim** produced the same prediction results as **fsim**.\r\n\r\nCan you explain why m.run() must be used instead of time_evaluator to generate the correct prediction result ?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the cycle_count in \"Execution statistics\" is equal to 0.

In this [line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4318/files#diff-8be7003a84f663f3f6b0dbb3bf1f5ba6R105), `h+dh` can be potentially out of boundary. `max(h) = out_h - 1 = in_h - filter_h + output_padding[0]` and `max(dh) = filter_h - 1`, therefore, `max(h+dh) = in_h + output_padding[0] - 1`. When `output_padding[0] >= 1`, `max(h+dh) >= in_h`, which is out of `data_pad` height boundary. Similar to `w+dw`.\r\n2. The x86 conv2d_transpose implementation is different from generic conv2d_tranpose. In x86, after you call `conv2d_transpose_nchw_preprocess`, you directly call the normal conv2d without using `output_padding`.\r\n\r\nI'll revert this PR for now. Could you fix these two bugs and double check whether cuda and arm_cpu implementation are correct? Further, could you investigate why CI doesn't catch these bugs?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574434976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574436966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4709#issuecomment-574436966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4709","id":574436966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDQzNjk2Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T00:20:45Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T00:20:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @yzhliu @zhiics @ZihengJiang ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574436966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574461129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4710#issuecomment-574461129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4710","id":574461129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDQ2MTEyOQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T02:04:35Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T02:04:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @tqchen @comaniac ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574461129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574480750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4710#issuecomment-574480750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4710","id":574480750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDQ4MDc1MA==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-15T03:36:06Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T03:36:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @zhiics @tqchen ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/574480750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
