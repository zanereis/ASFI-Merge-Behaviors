They are used in IMRU but do not need IMRU driver for testing. You can take Group Communication functional tests and there as master and slave tasks inject these *Host tasks. You simply need to define Map and Update functions needed by *Host tasks. Map function can be Identity and Update function can simply transmit an integer. Basically Master and Slave tasks in GC become Update and Map functions. Then modify the driver so that when you have all the RunningTasks, you send close message to one of the tasks. In one test send it to MapTaskHost and in other to UpdateTaskHost.\n\nMost of the code already exists and just needs to be massaged a little.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/221460077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/221464304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1014#issuecomment-221464304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1014","id":221464304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTQ2NDMwNA==","user":{"login":"tcNickolas","id":10113024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas","html_url":"https://github.com/tcNickolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T03:29:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T03:29:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks

I think either way is fine and won't necessarily preclude any optimizations, as an `IEnumerable<T>` can easily consist only of a single object and a `T` can also be an `IEnumerable` of some type of object. `T` here in this PR doesn't necessarily need to be a record type, it can also be a some pointer to a record type where you pass it through another transformation function to obtain the actual record type. @dkm2110 what was the original intention of the design?\n\nFor the `ISerializer` interface provided in this PR, one can implement a `Stream` that multiplexes between multiple `Stream` s. Either way, the muxing logic has to be implemented by the user. Personally I find it a bit unnatural for a Serializer to deserialize a collection of `Stream` s to a single object.\n\n@markusweimer @dkm2110 @jwang98052 On another note, I've been working on another more extensible `DataCache<T>` (which uses some Reflection techniques that I don't really like...), but we'll still need to answer the question of what `T` is intended to be first.\n\nI'll provide an update with a link to a branch with the new design in the JIRA once I am done.

Please look at it again. Thanks! \n\nI have spent almost a day to create a test driver for IMRU tasks. It is not simply to replace task class name in task configuration and add map.update function config with existing BroadCastReduce test driver, it involves too many configurations including group communication config, dataset/IInputPartition config, all the codec config, group communication client config, I was almost rewrite another IMRU driver but still end up wrong configurations. I feel we might just use IMRU driver and modify it for testing, but I am not sure if we should duplicate the prod code in testing, especially we are rewriting it now. For now, I don't think we should spend so much time to rewrite some thing for this type of testing. It should be covered by E2E testing.

The test triggers an `Alarm` on `ContextStart` which fails the Evaluator and exits the Evaluator process. On the exit of the Evaluator process, the local ResourceManager detects that the process has exited first and tells the Driver that the Evaluator has failed before the first Context Heartbeat is triggered, so the Driver does not know about the Evaluator's failed context, which our test asserts to exist, causing the test failure.
