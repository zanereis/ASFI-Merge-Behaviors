For those of us that need it, it would certainly be easy enough for us to add the jar (and we could add some gradle smarts to make it even easier for us to invoke). We would want to avoid the class not found errors in any case. The feature certainly better aligns the groovyConsole with the IDEA ASM plugin in terms of functionality.\r\n\r\nAs to how/if the asm util jar gets bundled it is less clear to me the best way. I am just not sure the functionality has wide enough appeal to warrant jarjar embedding it within the groovyAll jar for instance. Perhaps that would be the most seamless way but perhaps excluding it from jarjar embedding and just bundling the lib jar within the zip might be a better approach?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/279616025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/279641325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/465#issuecomment-279641325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/465","id":279641325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTY0MTMyNQ==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T08:38:08Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T08:38:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As the creator of the PR it's easiest for you to close.

If you did:\r\n```groovy -e \"println args\" *.groovy```\r\nthen windows would replace *.groovy with all the groovy filenames and pass all of them to your script (which in this case would just print out the names as a list).\r\n\r\nThis saved you having to worry about doing the expansion yourself - which at the time wasn't particularly easy outside of `ant`. I think that capability broke a long time ago and now only the first file found is returned or the error `The syntax of the command is incorrect` is returned if no matching file is found. I believe adding the `/F` will pass through the asterisk. This is a breaking change but in reality is probably what we want to do. We just need to document it and have some tests around it.\r\n\r\nSimilar suggestions have been made before but we haven't applied them because we never got the tests and doco in place. It would be great if you think you have time to flesh out either or both of those things but otherwise we'll add it to the long todo list.\r\n\r\nThe -D handling is also known about - our general strategy is that we want to reduce any processing happening in the bat file and have more handled in Groovy - but again we want some tests in place before making drastic changes.\r\n\r\nWe also need to get CI agents running windows that will then test any created tests - but that is a separate activity. If you do think you have time to do any additional work, I am happy to provide assistance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/288054730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/288060119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/443#issuecomment-288060119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/443","id":288060119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODA2MDExOQ==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-21T12:12:51Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T12:12:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did a bit more testing and couldn't break it so far.

T1 in endScope calls `atomicCategoryUsageCounter.decrementAndGet()` and receives `0`\r\n2. T2 in newScope calls `atomicCategoryUsageCounter.incrementAndGet()` and receives `1`\r\n3. T2 assigns `categoriesInUse` a value of `1`\r\n4. T1 assigns `categoriesInUse` a value of `0`\r\n5. Callsite called from T2 calls `hasCategoryInCurrentThread` and return is `false`\r\n\r\nAnother way to fix would be to remove the int counter and just use the existing AtomicInteger. However, my hunch is that the int counter was retained because `hasCategoryInCurrentThread()` is probably called frequently so there might have been some performance concern over requiring a method call and a volatile read that the AtomicInteger would incur in order to implement the quick exit check for that method (`if (categoriesInUse == 0) return false`).\r\n\r\nThere is also a race between scopes in calls to `DefaultMetaClassInfo.setCategoryUsed`, so I think it would also be good to add those calls to the synchronized blocks if they are added.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/301634717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/301959173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/541#issuecomment-301959173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/541","id":301959173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTk1OTE3Mw==","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-17T01:26:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T01:26:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good
