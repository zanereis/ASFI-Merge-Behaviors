- since HBase timestamps are ultimately derived from physical timestamps, rather than, say HLCs, we're already prone to weird effects from clock skew (such as different rs's having different clocks). This improves that in one aspect, since when the client-set timestamp \"wins\" it'll be consistent across region servers.\r\n\r\nI'm curious about the implications of letting the server timestamp win when the server is behind the client. What if the client clock is slightly ahead of a server? Don't we go back to inconsistent timestamps then?\r\n\r\nIt seems like a preference for either the client or the server can cause skew-related problems.\r\n\r\nWhen we honor the client timestamps, we get consistent timestamps across a logical operation no matter how many region servers it involves. However, we can get weird behavior where two clients with clock skew wrt each other can invert the order of operations.\r\n\r\nWhen we honor the server timestamps, we can enforce an order between client operations regardless of the clients' clocks, but we can get inconsistent timestamps within each operation. \r\n\r\nI can think of use cases I've worked with in the past that have a strong need for either consistent timestamps across a long-running operations and others with lots of small operations where order of operations across clients _really_ matters , so I'm thinking this needs to be configurable. \r\n\r\n@gjacoby126 - Thank you for the feedback. I agree with on almost all of the points you made. I am not sure about having a configuration parameter about this due to the conflict with SCN queries. I think we need to honor the client timestamps and it will improve the current situation as you pointed out. Initially, I started with the following logic:\r\nlong now = getTimestamp(firstMutation);\r\nif (now ==  HConstants.LATEST_TIMESTAMP) {\r\n     now = EnvironmentEdgeManager.currentTimeMillis()\r\n}\r\n\r\nThen I noticed that the client always sets the timestamp for mutations in my ITs. I changed the logic. I think as you said, we should either use the client or server timestamp. I will revert the logic, and so we will use the client timestamp when the client set it. What do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/654998520/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/655142442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/823#issuecomment-655142442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/823","id":655142442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTE0MjQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"gjacoby126","id":5717906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTc5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5717906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126","html_url":"https://github.com/gjacoby126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T21:22:44Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T21:22:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kadirozde - good point about the SCN. I think if this is configurable, there would need to be a validation check giving you an exception if you try to ask for both a client-set SCN and server side timestamps on mutations. \r\n\r\nI like your suggestion about a given operation deterministically using either the client or server timestamp. \r\n\r\nSeems to me the big question is how clients and servers decide which of those two to use. If it's the client's choice to either set or not set a timestamp, that still leaves the question of how the client chooses. Same if it's the server's choice -- is it a cluster setting, a table setting, or a hard-coded default? Dependent on mutable vs immutable? Lots of implications to work through for all possibilities, and I don't have a firm opinion yet. \r\n\r\nFor example, it would be good for a particular table to be able to override the default to say whether client or server-side timestamps should govern. I can also see it being useful for clients to request it as well as a connection property, as they do for SCN, but I worry a little about what happens if different clients make different choices...so I'm undecided.

Making this implicit for the sake of decoupling and abstracting does not work in this case and there is no problem with the current client  /user (IndexRebuildRegionScanner) and server/provider (UARO) model used here as far as I see.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/677915427/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/677926205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/860#issuecomment-677926205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/860","id":677926205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzkyNjIwNQ==","user":{"login":"gjacoby126","id":5717906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTc5MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5717906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126","html_url":"https://github.com/gjacoby126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjacoby126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T21:54:30Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T21:54:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IndexRebuildRegionScanner doesn't _need_ to know that it's in a bad state because the region is splitting or closing. It just needs to know that it's in a bad state, and to throw an exception. It's a scanner -- at a high level, it should understand open, close, and next(). Scanners and iterators don't usually close _themselves_, some external class does. \r\n\r\nSRP says that each class should have one reason for existing, and one reason to change. Say HBase 3 adds a new event we'd want to stop the scanner for that's not covered by UARO.checkForRegionClosingOrSplitting(). You'd have to modify IndexRebuildRegionScanner in a bunch of places to call UARO.checkForNewEventState(). On the other hand, if sending a close or kill signal to the scanner is UARO's responsibility, then adding a new region event just changes UARO, and the scanner doesn't change. \r\n\r\nIt's a cleaner separation of concerns.

a good question.\r\n\r\nOur main public API is JDBC, which doesn't have Guava in it.\r\norg.apache.phoenix.expression.function.ScalarFunction for UDFs doesn't have Guava in it either.\r\nOur tools are mainly the Index and bulk load related MR jobs, which are part of the release, and don't have programmatic APIs.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what other interfaces would count as public API, as we don't use @InterfaceAudience\r\n\r\nOne change of note is the use of (Tephra's) shaded guava classes for the shaded Tephra API, as Tephra DOES have guava in its Phoenix-facing API. However, this change is introduced in a new maven Tephra artifact, and the old Tephra artifact with unshaded Guava is still available in Tephra.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/693980777/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/694041309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/845#issuecomment-694041309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/845","id":694041309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDA0MTMwOQ==","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-17T07:34:08Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T07:34:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The connectors project builds without changes when using patched Phoenix.\r\nThe APIs used by connectors is the closest thing I can think of to LimitedPublic interfaces that we have.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/694041309/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
