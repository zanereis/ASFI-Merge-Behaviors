That was unfortunate indeed. \r\n\r\nI have a refactor (WIP) for the whole set of bash scripts to make them way simpler (#6500) - currently we are at 8/12 PRs (https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-5606) done for the production image change that simplified the scripts (and I will make a DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION there in common utils script that we will use).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is not always super-easy for the bash scripts - especially that so far we had a separate build script for Dockerhub (hooks/build) - this is where the whole build logic was implemented. We called this script from within other scripts (and separately in Dockerhub), and it got far too complex.\r\n\r\nI reverted the logic in (#6500) so that we have common utils used everywhere and then it will be possible to make it defined in one place and have one constant for it (in bash scripts).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/554798105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/554800995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6595#issuecomment-554800995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6595","id":554800995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDgwMDk5NQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-17T23:36:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-17T23:36:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And one more thing here @bolkedebruin  - for some of those scripts (static checks) we wanted to force always 3.5 version - no matter what you had setup as your current python version (simply because we wanted to run static checks consistently for all static checks.

I added a new \"deprecations\" package where i will put all the \"deprecated\" classes.
