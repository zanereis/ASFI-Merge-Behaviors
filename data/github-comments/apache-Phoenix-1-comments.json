We might be ok starting with that as long as you add specific test cases that test the lifecycle of these guideposts: adding the expected number for a given table with data across multiple regions, adding data to the table, re-analyzing removes old guideposts and adds new ones, a split cleans up the old ones and adds new ones, multi-tenant table with an analyze against it (i.e. testing a \"partial\" analyze).

I will do this for now and ensure that we are able to get the splits correctly.  Without that as split code does not work correctly - because from the split hook not able to do any updations on the split table.  So we could better target in another JIRA.  \nThe last intersect would ensure that though we get new guideposts based on the new regions and also the the other guide posts also matches with other region's end key we get overlapping Keyranges. So finally to resolve that we could intersect it with the region's start and end key.  @JamesRTaylor  What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/55643833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/55665720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/12#issuecomment-55665720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/12","id":55665720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NjY1NzIw","user":{"login":"JamesRTaylor","id":6176299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzYyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6176299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesRTaylor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-15T21:59:41Z","updated_at":"2014-09-15T21:59:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please see previous comments on the PTable interface, first try/catch block simplifications and the algorithm.

Then, when the batch has been sent, it'd call IndexQosCompat.removeIndexQosForTable(tableName, batchUUID), constructing the same key to remove it from the map. The IndexQosRpcControllerFactory would do a get on the concurrent map using only a key with only the tableName (that matches any batchUUID) in order to know it should use the special queue. That way, the map still gets cleaned up, but works when many different callers are writing index updates at the same time (as the tableName + batch UUID would always be unique). This also avoids the corner case of an index being dropped and subsequently a table being created with the same name. The current Config based approach would find that table name for the table and use the high priority queue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/83363422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/83401354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/47#issuecomment-83401354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/47","id":83401354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNDAxMzU0","user":{"login":"gabrielreid","id":527401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzQwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielreid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielreid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-19T07:57:47Z","updated_at":"2015-03-19T07:57:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@naveenmadhire the added test cases look good, but it looks like your most-recent commit also removed the integration test.\n\nThe integration test should include a test like before (basically checking that the function works in a real use case), as well as checking that it works when used as a filter, something like:\n\n```\nselect * from table t where instr(t.value, 'test') > 5\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/83401354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/83573791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/47#issuecomment-83573791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/47","id":83573791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTczNzkx","user":{"login":"nmadhire","id":8851548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTE1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8851548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire","html_url":"https://github.com/nmadhire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmadhire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-19T13:32:20Z","updated_at":"2015-03-19T13:32:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am having some configuration issues when running a end-2-end test cases.

It looks like the reason that you're getting issues with the DESC tests is because you're returning the SortOrder of the underlying column in the getSortOrder method. Just removing the getSortOrder method completely should resolve this.\n\nIt looks like the filter tests also won't work. This will be because the function instance isn't correctly being deserialized/initialized on the server side. Adding in the following method will ensure that the initialization happens correctly:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void readFields(DataInput input) throws IOException {\n    super.readFields(input);\n    init();\n}\n```\n\nI also took a closer look at the actual testing of the string searching functionality. It looks to me like this could be a lot more simple, although maybe I'm missing something. However, wouldn't it work to just do the following in the evaluate method:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic boolean evaluate(Tuple tuple, ImmutableBytesWritable ptr) {\n\n    if (!getStringExpression().evaluate(tuple, ptr)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    String sourceStr = (String) PVarchar.INSTANCE.toObject(ptr, getStringExpression().getSortOrder());\n\n    int position = sourceStr.indexOf(strToSearch);\n    ptr.set(PInteger.INSTANCE.toBytes(position));\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nCould you see if that works ok for all test cases, etc? It looks like the code in the `searchString` method is doing a lot of unnecessary array copying otherwise.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/85666137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
