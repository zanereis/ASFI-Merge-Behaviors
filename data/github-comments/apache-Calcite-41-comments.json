The expression `SEARCH($1, Sarg[[1000..2000]; NULL AS FALSE])` must return FALSE if $1 is null, but the previous expansion `AND(>=($1, 1000), <=($1, 2000))` would instead return UNKNOWN.\r\n\r\nThere's some subtle interaction between Sarg's 'nullAs' field and the 'unknownAs' behavior during code generation. If you're implementing `WHERE x BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000`, you want an expression that returns either UNKNOWN or FALSE if x is null. You don't actually care which, and if you're generating SQL you probably prefer `x >= 1000 AND x <= 2000` to `x IS NOT NULL AND x >= 1000 AND x <= 2000` because it's shorter.\r\n\r\nSo, your use case is a bug somewhere in the query preparation process, but I think `expandSearch` is now doing the right thing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/786175844/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/786176598","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2357#issuecomment-786176598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2357","id":786176598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NjE3NjU5OA==","user":{"login":"julianhyde","id":1130553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde","html_url":"https://github.com/julianhyde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/julianhyde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T20:22:15Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T20:22:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I have also run the test suite of our downstream project using this PR, no issue was detected \r\n\r\n@rubenada, Thanks for testing this change.
