Here call is being made to `scoverage.Invoker.` with the position id\r\n\r\n```java\r\n public Seq<String> whisk$core$entity$EntityPath$$apply(Seq<String> parts)\r\n    throws IllegalArgumentException\r\n  {\r\n    Invoker..MODULE$.invoked(3331, \"/absolute/path/of/openwhisk/openwhisk/common/scala/build/scoverage\"); Invoker..MODULE$.invoked(3329, \"/absolute/path/of/openwhisk/openwhisk/common/scala/build/scoverage\"); Invoker..MODULE$.invoked(3327, \"/absolute/path/of/apache/openwhisk/openwhisk/common/scala/build/scoverage\"); Object \r\n```\r\n\r\nNow as test execute and the code path gets executed it would record the invocation in `build/scoverage/scoverage.measurements.xxx` files (xxx maps to threadId). Post test complete a task is run which consumes the measurement file and scoverage.coverage.xml to produce a `build/reports/scoverage/scoverage.xml` which the coverage file for that module. Then multiple coverage file can be combined to produce the final report\r\n\r\n### Runtime classpath implication\r\n\r\nFor the instrumented code to work we need to include following deps in classpath (current version 1.3.1)\r\n\r\n1.  org.scoverage:scalac-scoverage-plugin_2.11\r\n2. org.scoverage:scalac-scoverage-runtime_2.11\r\n\r\nThis is simpler for unit test or tests where code from common, invoker and controller is run in same vm as test cases as the scoverage gradle plugin adapts the classpaths. However it posses some challenge with Docker setups\r\n\r\n[1]: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.scoverage\r\n[2]: https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/362995897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/363046501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3240#issuecomment-363046501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3240","id":363046501,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzA0NjUwMQ==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T10:40:40Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T10:40:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note for the kind reviewers:\r\n\r\nThe code to process active acks etc. is mostly unchanged.

But, FWIW, there was a decent reason to use the more complex concept that I try to summarize below (before I forget).\r\n\r\nThe future-based implementation is now similar to the sequence implementation. It creates one pending future (ie pending continuation) for each level of nesting (sequence inside a sequence, composition inside a composition). In contrast the promise-based implementation only requires one pending continuation irrespective of nesting. It used instead a call stack (now removed caller field in session object) and unwinds the stack upon termination of a nested composition. Concretely, the callee resumes the execution of the caller explicitly with the promise implementation, whereas with the future implementation all the stack levels simultaneously exist as pending tasks in the scheduler. In short, I believe the future implementation is by nature more expensive. But since we cap the recursion depth to a low value, it is most likely irrelevant in practice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/363658304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/363768473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3253#issuecomment-363768473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3253","id":363768473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mzc2ODQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"starpit","id":4741620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDE2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4741620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit","html_url":"https://github.com/starpit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starpit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-07T13:28:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-07T13:28:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks

I agree on your points. \r\n\r\nWe are developing web UI using Openwhisk APIs, for action developers to create and manage their actions apart from wsk CLI. \r\n\r\nFor user and namespace management specifically,  we have created an another light weight external service (python+flask), which expose custom APIs to manage few operations on UI like getting all namespaces associated with user, checking if user is part of any given namespace, adding user to sandbox (default) namespace if user logged in first time to UI etc. \r\n\r\nThis service does not directly call the couch DB APIs to do these operations, instead custom APIs leverage/depend-on 'wskadmin' command for these operation (as wskadmin already does call the couchdb APIs internally). We also deployed this service on boot instance as part of our openwhisk deployment (where wskadmin command is available) via ansible using the existing deployment framework for our needs.    \r\n\r\nI agree and it is fine, not to support 'create' operation in namespace controller, given the fact that namespace controller is only reader of subjects. But can we support a flag/option in wskadmin command to specify a user as owner of the namespace while creating namespace, that way we can extend our UI and service to enable namespace owners to manage other subjects. \r\n\r\nI can try to do a poc on this.
