Here are the steps to reproduce and an analysis what is possibly going on.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install next version after having NetBeans already installed. (e.g. NB21 over 20).\r\n2. Proceed with Import Settings from previous version on first run.\r\n3. Open Start Page and navigate to What's New.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n- News feed should load.\r\n\r\n### Actual result\r\n\r\n- Error while loading content is displayed  (Reload does not work).\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\n1. Go to [settings directory]/config/Preferences/org/netbeans/modules/\r\n2. Delete welcome.properties, or just delete the date from the atom feed.\r\n3. Restart the IDE\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, when settings are being imported from a previous version, `welcome.properties` is copied and it contains the date of the fetched atom feed, but the actual cached atom feed file is not copied from the old cache.\r\n\r\n`blogs.apache.org/netbeans/feed/entries/atom=Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:36:54 GMT` \r\n\r\nLet's take look at the following: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/736cf60be7411e88064c83bc947f62cd6b3b76b9/nb/welcome/src/org/netbeans/modules/welcome/content/RSSFeed.java#L341-L349\r\n\r\nThe exception caught here (and the \"Error while loading content\" displayed) is possibly thrown by an attempt to read the atom feed from the cache file, which, as mentioned before, in this case contains no data: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/736cf60be7411e88064c83bc947f62cd6b3b76b9/nb/welcome/src/org/netbeans/modules/welcome/content/RSSFeed.java#L214-L218\r\n\r\nChecking the cache file size and/or actual content may be considered, or even removing the SAXException catch and eventually defaulting to the next one as an attempt to reload the news feed:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/736cf60be7411e88064c83bc947f62cd6b3b76b9/nb/welcome/src/org/netbeans/modules/welcome/content/RSSFeed.java#L350-L356","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1983879492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1983940995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4288#issuecomment-1983940995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4288","id":1983940995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M52QImD","user":{"login":"mhalachev","id":2463597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjM1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2463597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev","html_url":"https://github.com/mhalachev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhalachev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-07T16:32:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-07T16:32:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbien Please take a look at the aforementioned.

I can work on that if there is consensus on that being a reasonable path forward.\r\n\r\nYep, that' s a good idea, I think. We could lay out things like so:\r\n\r\n- \"cnd.makeproject.lsp\", responsible for generating the compilation database for NetBeans \"makeproject\"-type projects.\r\n- \"cnd.lsp\", responsible for launching one or more LSP servers in background using \"ide/lsp.client\"\r\n    - Projects should define the \"flavor\" of the LSP server they wan to run (say \"clangd\" or \"ccls\"). \r\n    - This could be as simple returning an implementation of an interface in the project's Lookup. This interface could return the flavor of the LSP server (ccls or clangd) and maybe the location of the compilation database relative to the project's root, for instance.\r\n    - Some LSP servers can handle multiple projects, others cannot. This may require more investigation. AFAIK a single \"clangd\" process can handle different projects (cnd.lsp launches a single clangd process), whereas \"ccls\" requires a process per project. \"cnd.lsp\" should handle this gracefully.\r\n\r\nBTW, \"ide/lsp.client\" will need some refactoring because of race conditions. The \"rust-analyzer\" LSP server is complaining that we're sending open document notifications when the server has not been initialized yet.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Do we need some kind of plan to try to have some kind of CND available in NB 22 or is that just a waste of time and effort should be focused on finishing up Jan's work?\r\n\r\nI think we should wait to see if Jan can do some progress in improving cpplite with the cnd gdb debuggers.
