I think you're encountering a common problem having to do with the start date -- Airflow schedules DAGs for the period AFTER the start date, not ON the start date. (For example, the daily run for a DAG on 3/25 actually starts on 3/26). Since your start date is always read as \"right now\", the scheduler never gets to the \"next\" period. Try making your start_date `now() + timedelta(days=-1)` and I think it should work. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/204982620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/204982979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/1253#issuecomment-204982979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1253","id":204982979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDk4Mjk3OQ==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-03T14:08:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-03T14:08:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@timseries I think that would be a good enhancement.

really like this idea. In fact I would like to use this to eliminate the short circuit operator (because even though it was created to make a confusing situation simpler, it's still pretty confusing). With a `pre_execute()` hook that possibly raises an `AirflowSkipException`, ANY operator can short-circuit.\n\nI still need to look at the implementation but here are a couple thoughts:\n- please add some unit tests. I have some open PRs that make these sort of tests easier; let me know if you'd like help setting them up. \n- errors are the primary means of communicating state to processes in Airflow. I think it would be best to subclass `AirflowException` and maybe call this something less frightening like `AirflowOperatorSkip`\n- following up that idea, it would be nice to analogously raise `AirflowOperatorFail` or `AirflowDagDeadlock` as appropriate... If they were also subclasses that could be done with minimal code changes. That could be a separate PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/205248899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/205252932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1269#issuecomment-205252932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1269","id":205252932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTI1MjkzMg==","user":{"login":"artwr","id":1518713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTg3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1518713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr","html_url":"https://github.com/artwr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artwr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T11:26:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T11:26:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yep, figured out that out reading the tests failures.

I think the issue is that you want two `TaskInstance`s to be equal when their `(dag_id, task_id, execution_date)`'s match(like in the `__eq__` implementation in this PR), since this is the primary key of the `TaskInstance` ORM. The problem without this can be seen in this modification of your example:\n\n```\nimport airflow\nimport datetime\nimport copy\nfrom airflow.models import DAG, TaskInstance as TI\nfrom airflow.operators import DummyOperator\n\nstart_date = datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 1)\n\ndag = DAG('dag')\nop = DummyOperator(task_id='op', dag=dag, start_date=start_date, owner='airflow')\nti = TI(op, start_date)\nti.__hash__() # [hash]\n\ntest_set = set()\ntest_set.add(ti)\nlen(test_set) # 1\n\ncopy_ti = copy.deepcopy(ti)\ncopy_ti in test_set #False\ntest_set.remove(copy_ti) #KeyError\n```\n\nIsn't `elif ti in self.queued_tis:` more like `copy_ti in test_set`, rather than `ti in test_set`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/205544019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/205546875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1290#issuecomment-205546875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1290","id":205546875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTU0Njg3NQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T23:46:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T23:46:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/5661282/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/5661282)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.7%) to 67.76% when pulling **8f7e5d44b442b7185919866c43edccef313f0533 on jlowin:subdag-backfill-status** into **0bae60ff84a8dc8b3deb1e856757c752ac1d714e on airbnb:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/205546875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/205549467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1299#issuecomment-205549467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1299","id":205549467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTU0OTQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T23:54:12Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T23:54:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ah, I understand what you mean.
