Updating the plugin gets it closer to working, but it still has an error, because the latest version of clover doesn't work with gradle 8 due to [the removal of the deprecated outputDir property of the SourceDirectorySet](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#sourcedirectoryset_api_cleanup)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd be inclined to remove the coverage report plugin since it's not used in the build and doesn't work anyway, but I'm not sure if @jimexist wants to try to get it working. For now, I'll just merge this to get rid of the dependabot noise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2290629033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2290631501","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2794#issuecomment-2290631501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2794","id":2290631501,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U86IiENN","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-15T05:08:47Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T05:08:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See

I think it would be easy to get ASF INFRA to approve it if they haven't already.\r\n\r\nHowever, my bigger concerns are that they won't work correctly:\r\n\r\n1. the `setup-gradle` action sets up the gradle wrapper in the root of the project. We only use it in `lib/java` (or `lib/kotlin`) and expect it to be set up there. I spent quite a bit of time trying to set up the gradle wrapper outside of the project tree, so it could be used only as version control (like `rvm` or `rbenv` are used to manage ruby installations), but it wouldn't work because the gradle wrapper very strictly requires being installed inside an existing project and cannot be easily used to manage versions outside of a project. Since the `setup-gradle` action doesn't have the option to specify the target directory (that I could find), we'd have to substantially change things around to have gradlew installed at the root of the project to work with this action.\r\n2. even if we use `setup-gradle` action, I don't think `./configure` would find it without additional changes to `configure.ac`, and it would still use `gradle` from the environment when building with `make` instead of `./gradlew`. Perhaps there's a way to specify the gradle command directly using a `./configure` flag that I don't know about? If so, then perhaps we can force it to use `./gradlew` instead of `gradle`, but I don't know how to do that.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that it's probably not worth changing right now. However, perhaps it might be possible to just simplify the installation of our preferred gradle version by installing it in local directory and adding it to the PATH, rather than trying to clobber the system-provided gradle using `sudo`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2292301353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2300030226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/3027#issuecomment-2300030226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/3027","id":2300030226,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U86JF60S","user":{"login":"Xuanwo","id":5351546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTE1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5351546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo","html_url":"https://github.com/Xuanwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Xuanwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-21T01:21:55Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T01:21:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc

You also need API compliance with the cross compilation to Java 8. For javac, that's what the `--release` flag does, in addition to setting the source and target. We need something similar implemented here for the Kotlin stuff. We don't actually need to remove the toolchain, because that's a separate matter. It's fine to keep the toolchain and set it to 17, like we do for Java. But we need to make sure the Kotlin option is set that is equivalent to the javac release flag. That's why I linked to the additional detailed information about that option. I'm just not sure the right way to use it. However, I can tell that your added commit doesn't do that. It only sets the source and target.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2380418986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/2380448000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/3043#issuecomment-2380448000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/3043","id":2380448000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U86N4sEA","user":{"login":"thomasbruggink","id":16775318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzc1MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16775318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink","html_url":"https://github.com/thomasbruggink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomasbruggink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-28T06:54:27Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T06:54:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the pointers, I missed the nuance of the `--release` flag.\r\nAs the blog post you linked points out, there currently isn't a flag in the Kotlin Gradle plugin that allows setting the `-Xjdk-release` flag.

It seems that the action runner for Ubuntu 22.04 has Java 8 installed by default https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md#java\r\nThe toolchain option in [gradle says](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection) that automatically detects toolchains, so I think it can find the JDK 8 installation and will use javac from the JDK 8 installation. This in contrast to the docker build environment where it needs to use the JDK 17 javac and produce something that works on java 8.\r\n\r\nMaybe this would be testable by manually removing JDK 8 from the runner. But the fact that we now removed the toolchain option and added `-release` and it still compiles might also be proof that it works as expected.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce in the docker image:\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -v $(pwd):/thrift/src -it thrift /bin/bash\r\n$ ./bootstrap.sh\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ make all # <- this will brake on the kotlin compile step before this
