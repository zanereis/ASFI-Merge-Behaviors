AFAIK, on shutdown I am explicitly stopping all of the running threads in the executor service, waiting a few seconds for them to complete and then doing a \"shutdown now\".  Any ideas on what might be causing the issue?  Have you seen this behavior before in other processors?

I don't think this is the right approach, however, As-is, the code ensures that we don't hold any more than a set number of entries in the cache.

Can you explain how you arrived at the determination that the existing code is slow? What kind of performance are you seeing? What performance do you expect?

Thank you for your reply. We have a quite heavy-loaded environment. We are processing about 5 GB / min of messages on 32 core host. Avro serialization was our main bottleneck. We had avg 30 threads concurrently using this service. CPU usage was on 85%, iowaits near 0, load on 50. Increasing of number of threads didn't help. As I wrote in issue, I found out that the synchronization is an issue by sampling (doing occasional thread dumps). Most of thread was blocked on it. After this modification, we stopped to occur such a performance issue.\r\n\r\nRegards to removing of limitation of entries in the cache. I agree with you that it isn't the best approach. Limitation of 20 schemas wasn't either. In systems with multiple flows, commonly using the same service, this limit would be constantly hit. What do you think about introducing two parameters to this service: Cache Size Limit and Time To Leave? After hitting one of them, entry would be evicted. Condition would be checked during each entry get. Similar to `cachedSchema.isOlderThan` check in `CachingSchemaRegistryClient`. If we assume that these limits would be soft one, it won't need synchronization.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/434013642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/434045896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3111#issuecomment-434045896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3111","id":434045896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDA0NTg5Ng==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-29T19:24:28Z","updated_at":"2018-10-29T19:24:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arkadius fair enough.

DFDL is a language capable of describing many data formats, including textual and binary, commercial record-oriented, scientific and numeric, modern and legacy, and many industry standards. It leverages XML technology and concepts, using a subset of W3C XML schema type system and annotations to describe such data. Daffodil uses this data description to \"parse\" data into an XML representation of the data. This allows one to take advantage of the many XML and JSON technologies (e.g. XQuery, XPath, XSLT) to ingest, validate, and manipulate complex data formats. Daffodil can also use this data description to \"unparse\", or serialize, the XML or JSON representation back to the original data format.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a new Daffodil bundle containing DaffodilParse and DaffodilUnparse processors.\r\n\r\nFor an example of it's usage, I've provided a NiFi template here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/stevedlawrence/5a8259c9fffb3cb3b317ba31a6ef0494#file-daffodil_pcap_filter_nifi_template-xml\r\n\r\nWhich looks like this:\r\n\r\n![nifi-daffodil-pcap-filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3180601/48017874-6a536c80-e0fd-11e8-9aa0-3eb785a99157.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo set the environment up to work with this template, perform the following:\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p /tmp/nifi/{getfile,putfile}\r\ngit clone https://github.com/DFDLSchemas/PCAP.git /tmp/nifi/PCAP\r\ncurl \"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stevedlawrence/5a8259c9fffb3cb3b317ba31a6ef0494/raw/c19fddd6d1e73777e10a549bfd369b077aefbb50/pcap-filter.xsl\" > /tmp/nifi/pcap-filter.xsl\r\n```\r\nThe template has 5 processors in a single pipeline that performs the following\r\n1. **GetFile** - Reads a PCAP file from ``/tmp/nifi/getfile``\r\n1. **DaffodilParse** - Parses the PCAP file to an XML representation\r\n1. **TransformXML** - Removes all XML elements that have an IP address of ``192.168.170.8``\r\n1. **DaffodilUnparse** - Unparses the filtered XML back to PCAP file format\r\n1. **PutFile** - Writes the filtered PCAP file to ``/tmp/nifi/putfile``\r\n\r\nTo test this flow, perform the following:\r\n```\r\ncp /tmp/nifi/PCAP/src/test/resources/com/tresys/pcap/data/dns.cap /tmp/nifi/getfile/\r\n```\r\nThe original dns.cap file has about 40 packets. After filtering, the new pcap file written by daffodil has approximately 10 that were not filtered out.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/435982103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/435988417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2882#issuecomment-435988417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2882","id":435988417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTk4ODQxNw==","user":{"login":"david-streamlio","id":35466513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDY2NTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35466513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio","html_url":"https://github.com/david-streamlio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-streamlio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T18:46:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T18:46:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rumbin I am merging in changes from @pvillard31, and correcting some minor issues that cause the processors to hang in certain situations.

From what I can tell, a Reader converts data to a Record, and a Writer converts those Records back to the data format? Is that accurate? My one concern is that although DFDL/Daffodil can handle record oriented data, often times it is much more complex. For example, the [daffodil examples](https://daffodil.apache.org/examples/) page shows two examples of how DFDL can convert data to XML. The first example is CSV data and is clearly record oriented. But the second example is PCAP (used in the above template) which could be seen as records, but is a complex nesting and there's a global header that isn't really a record. Most data formats we've seen DFDL used for a more like the latter. \r\n\r\nThe SchemaRegistry concept that looks to be used by Readers/Writers seems like a really nice way to provide a DFDL schema (if possible without using the Records?), but I'm not sure how well the Record concept fits in. Does it make sense to keep the XML/JSON output as in the PR, and then if a particular infoset does map well to a Record the user could add a JSON/XMLReader to convert to a record?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/436249066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/436267372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3124#issuecomment-436267372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3124","id":436267372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjI2NzM3Mg==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T14:16:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T14:16:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm good with removing the README once 1.9.0 is released, or changing it to a link to the new toolkit docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/436267372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
