The purpose of a split (in an IO) is to create sources anyway.\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\n> Maybe a simple splitIntoSources?\r\n\r\n`Source#splitIntoSources()` looks a bit confusing, perhaps because it may not be immediately apparent why one needs to have more sources from the source she already has. I guess that while this method does return a list of things that are technically sources, it may not be intuitive for us humans to think of this process as splitting a source into sources (sounds a bit off).\r\n\r\nWhat I like about simply `split` is that it does not put the emphasis on what the source is **being split into** (bundles/sources/sub-sources, etc.), but on the mere fact the it is **being split** (so that it can be parallelised).\r\n\r\nMakes
