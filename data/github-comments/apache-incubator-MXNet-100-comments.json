I have one problem before I can make this fully useful. For the Julia GPU codegen we have a NDArray-like type that exists on the GPU so you can just write normal Julia code and use all the convenience methods of Julia arrays on the GPU. Currently `decorate` inserts the shape of the array into the code we compile qith nvrtc, but on the Julia side I can't do that. Instead I would need to setup the array object in GPU memory and then set the data pointer to the NDArray. \n\nAny idea how to non-disruptively do this with the current code path? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/238306316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/238308350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2958#issuecomment-238308350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2958","id":238308350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODMwODM1MA==","user":{"login":"Taco-W","id":12106925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTA2OTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12106925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W","html_url":"https://github.com/Taco-W","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taco-W/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T17:25:27Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T17:25:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NoListen It's merged now.

, sorry about the confusion. My problem is very similar to the one stated in the original post, where each image is associated with hundreds of thousands of labels/classes (i.e., multi-label problem). If you feed `path_imglist` with the labels of all images in `ImageRecordIter`, all of the labels will be loaded for one time into RAM before the training starts. So in my case, the label file is too huge to load them directly in

@piiswrong @tornadomeet \nMaybe I don't show my task specific.\nI have a dataset contains 10W images and every image has two labels like -1.257 and 4.325.\nSo I follw the im2rec.py build the lst file like:\n\n```\n98572   -1.7156 1.257   1200292226/20100406_065150.jpg\n98573   -1.7445 1.2286  1200292226/20100406_070056.jpg\n98574   -1.7823 1.1922  1200292226/20100406_071240.jpg\n98575   -1.8101

1200292226/20100406_080359.jpg\n```\n\nThen I use the tool im2rec transform the lst file to rec file with label_width=2\n\nThe purpose of my task is making a prediction of a image and generate the two number like the type in lst file of the image at the same time.\n\nThen I copy `find_mxnet.py`,`train_model.py`,`train_alexnet.py`,`symbol_googlenet.py` provided in mxnet/example/image-classfication to my folder \nAnd built my net in `symbol.mynet.py`.(I have renamed this file) The last layer of my net is:\n\n```\ns2_fc2 = mx.symbol.FullyConnected(data=s2_relu5, num_hidden=2)\nlinearRegression = mx.symbol.LinearRegressionOutput(data=s2_fc2, name=\"softmax\")\nreturn linearRegression\n```\n\n**Q1----I have searched in google about multi-label task in mxnet and I have notice that the last layer of my net   may be wrong. But I don't know how to write the output layer in the correct way.**\n\nI built my dataiter in `train_mynet.py` with ImageRecordIter\n\n```\ndef get_iterator(args, kv):\n    data_shape = (3, args.data_shape, args.data_shape)\n    train = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(\n        path_imgrec = os.path.join(args.data_dir, args.train_dataset),\n        mean_img = \"/home/deeper/10W-project/ye_train.bin\",\n        data_shape  = data_shape,\n        path_imglist= \"/home/deeper/10W-project/ye_train.lst\",\n        label_width = 2,\n        batch_size  = args.batch_size,\n        num_parts   = kv.num_workers,\n        part_index  = kv.rank)\n    val = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(\n        path_imgrec = os.path.join(args.data_dir, args.val_dataset),\n        mean_img = \"/home/deeper/10W-project/ye_train.bin\",\n        rand_crop   = False,\n        rand_mirror = False,\n        data_shape  = data_shape,\n        path_imglist= \"/home/deeper/10W-project/ye_val.lst\",\n        label_width = 2,\n        batch_size  = args.batch_size,\n        num_parts   = kv.num_workers,\n        part_index  = kv.rank)\n\n    return (train, val)\n```\n\n**Q2-----All  preparations of my task is show above. But the training process is going on only when I set the batch_size=1.  I  will encounter the error'AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'sum'' when I change the batch_size. Can you give me some advise with your professional eye.**\n\n--------------update---------------\nWith the files and code I have prepared, I have found the error `AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'sum'`  occured when I train in multi-label.
