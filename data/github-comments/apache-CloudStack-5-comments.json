Why? Besides the IP tables we now have also the whole router configuration (e.g. guest networks, public IPs, vm metadata, etc) persisted in JSON files, which are managed by new Java code - all part of the Persistent SystemVM/Redundant VPC features. That was a huge change pushed towards Master about a month ago. We are busy testing it in order to get 100% for 4.6.\n\n@bhaisaab could you elaborate on that or do you think it would make sense to cherry-pick? Also to keep in mind, new features would be expected to go under a 4.x release.\n\nConcerning the iptables-persistent: when I started looking into it I saw that the new package was introduced in Debian Squeeze (6.0). So, why not use it. :) Following Debian's wiki and other site I understood that one would only need to save the configuration in the rules.v4/6 files and they would be picked up automatically by the iptables-persistent during reboot. So, based on that I did:\n\niptables-save > /etc/iptables/rulesv4/6\n\nThat was already enough to break all the routes. I also noticed that after a restart the iptables-vpcroutes was being loaded, instead of the rules.v4.\n\nTo be honest, I did not \"/etc/init.d/iptables-persistent start\" to load and \"/etc/init.d/iptables-persistent save\" as you pointed in your first comment.\n\nWhat can I do from here: I can give it a try with iptables-persistent using start/save to see if it will work fine. I can also change the current way I'm doing to do the iptables-restore here /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables instead of in the rc.local file.\n\nI'm always in for improvements and the right way to do things. :)\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/93194201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/93206215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/167#issuecomment-93206215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/167","id":93206215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzMjA2MjE1","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-15T05:54:33Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T05:54:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@resmo @wilderrodrigues I would avoid cherry-picking this feature on 4.5; AFAIK if a router reboots, cloudstack should re-apply any iptables rules and patch it again using systemvm.iso.
