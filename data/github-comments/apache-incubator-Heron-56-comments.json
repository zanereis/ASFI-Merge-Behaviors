Why not just have one object that is a map that has the info for both and gives you the flexibility of having optional arguments.  I don't think this solution is that complex.

Thanks for your comments. \r\nFirst, I agree that the way ports are currently managed is error prone. Thanks for taking this up.\r\nHowever, this PR is addressing some future needs and I don't understand them well. Personally I find this solution overfitting. I think it would be better for one more reviewer to take a look.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/341754643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/341837981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2515#issuecomment-341837981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2515","id":341837981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTgzNzk4MQ==","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-03T22:00:59Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T22:00:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The issue I was fixed was resolved by another pull request.

I do like the _addition_ of a collections interface here, but I'm not sure how I feel about making `Collection<T> get()` the _sole_ method for retrieving data from a source. The current `T get()` method makes a lot more sense for me when it comes to basically all of the use cases that I've worked with. What would be some use cases where the collections interface would be, in fact, _required_? I suppose batch processing might be an example, but even then it's not yet clear to me what the collections construct yields.

Is it for users or for internal cases?**\r\n\r\nMentioned in the description of the PR, the use cases are:\r\n\r\n1 . Users don't have to use additional threads in their topology to use a timers.\r\n2. Collectors are not thread safe so use other threads to emit tuples will cause race conditions. Using timer events part of the slave event loop with prevent that since its the same thread.\r\n3. Tick tuples are cumbersome to use to trigger events and you can only have tick tuples emitted at one frequency.\r\n4. Can also use in spout while tick tuples are only supported for bolts\r\n\r\nThis could be used by the user writing the topology or by a bolt we implement for the user such as the windowed bolt.\r\n\r\n**Timer event is for topology? Will it be potentially in Spout/Bolt level?**\r\n\r\nThis could be used in a spout or bolt\r\n\r\n**Is it possible that we may need an per-timer on/off feature in future?**\r\n\r\nI don't see this as a valid use case\r\n\r\n**Is there a limit of how many timers can we have and how long/short can it be? Suggest to check the duration to be at least positive.**\r\n\r\nHow many timers or the duration of timers should be up to the user.  The user should already understand the obvious performance consequences if there are too many timers or the timer frequency is too often.  We can check that the duration is positive though.  I will add that.\r\n\r\n**tickTupleFreqMs becomes hidden. It might be better to be more explicit (like sharing TimerEvent code but having a standalone PrepareTickTupleTimer function).**\r\n\r\nWe can, but to be honest, this feature more or less deprecates tick tuples. Tick tuples are not very easy to use for triggering timer events.  This feature makes it much easier and more natural.\r\n\r\nI will move initializing tick tuples to its own function\r\n\r\n**I am not familiar with this looper object and .
