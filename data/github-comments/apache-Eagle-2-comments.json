\n\nThe error of #51 occurs because the title of the PR is not in the expected format, it starts with \"EAGLE-114:\" but not \"EAGLE-114\", there is an additional \":\"\nFor sure, it's possible to support passing jira-id, do you mean in this way we don't have to check the title, but instead only to form a correct title by the script itself? I think this is a good idea, but if we're just to tolerant the possible marks in PR title next to jira id, I think in the regular expression to validate PR title, we can add some acceptable marks following jira id, which would save users the possibility of inputting wrong jira id. As we know, there has been a few times that people mistook the PR number to close, if we ask them to input jira id, it may be a little troublesome. What's your opinion?\n\nBTW, did you mean to get author's email from the info in patch file or some other place? Actually we can get a lot of info from a pr url, but emails may vary in different places. E.g. my global git config takes company's account and email as a user, but for apache projects, I have to config the local user with github accounts, if anyone forget this, the email info in commits will be different. So, which will be better reliable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/170446226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/170446877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/eagle/pull/42#issuecomment-170446877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/42","id":170446877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDQ0Njg3Nw==","user":{"login":"anyway1021","id":2068503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2068503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021","html_url":"https://github.com/anyway1021","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anyway1021/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-11T06:51:35Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T06:51:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updates made until commit \"359546f\":\n1.

In our case, SiddhiPolicyEvaluator and MLPolicyEvaluator should implement this above interface\n3. It is PolicyEvaluator implementation's responsibility to determine if the policy should be marked down based on parsing for Siddhi case. For SiddhiPolicyEvaluator, we can catch exception from createSiddhiRuntime method, then markdown this policy by setting one field(markedDown) to be true. That can be in SiddhiPolicyEvaluator constructor method and onPolicyUpdate method\n4. It is PolicyProcessExecutor's responsibility to report markdown status back to eagle service.

applied the patch and run and found many issues with code structure, error handling, existing code compatibility etc, let us hold off this patch and let me try to reconstruct the code.\nThe main issues are:\n1. Bad error handling. Exceptions are not brought from bottom to up so you have no idea of what happens if some exception is thrown\n2. No support for existing code compatibility. If we use notificationexecutor, why do we keep AlertPersistExecutor? We should make sure our code is complete. That is a bad idea to keep both old and new code. \n3. Unit test is not complete, some not passed\n4. Some basic java code issues for example      List<AlertDefinitionAPIEntity> activeAlerts = new ArrayList<AlertDefinitionAPIEntity>();, but it is assigned immediately after this. Some implementation class should be better in different package with good naming convention.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/182518082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/184918333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/eagle/pull/87#issuecomment-184918333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/87","id":184918333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDkxODMzMw==","user":{"login":"yonzhang","id":2691355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTEzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2691355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/yonzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-16T23:26:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-16T23:26:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, but 2 minor issues.\n1) echo $job  should be changed to echo \"$job\", otherwise it will show something strange because of literal character \"*\"\n2) unit test is passed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/184918333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/comments/185025673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/eagle/pull/88#issuecomment-185025673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/eagle/issues/88","id":185025673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTAyNTY3Mw==","user":{"login":"yonzhang","id":2691355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTEzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2691355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/yonzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T05:09:29Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T05:09:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"to be fixed:\n3. alert persist should be after entitydedupe or emaildedupe.
