this change is forcing every consumer to have one instance of dispatcher limiter.\r\n\r\numm..that's not correct. Rate-Limiter is per dispatcher-level so, not every consumer will create a rate-limiter but it will be limited at subscription level. Also, this PR is not creating additional object but it just creates RateLimiter object in a thread-safe way.\r\n\r\n> But from the code, this looks like a lazy creation, which could avoid creating a dispatchRateLimiter if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually existing code is also initializing rate-limiter as soon as subscription reads the message. It's lazy, non-thread-safe and unnecessary if throttling is not configured for the subscription: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentDispatcherSingleActiveConsumer.java#L373\r\n\r\nHowever, we can avoid creating rateLimiter object if throttling is not configured and it can save us some heap. I will make the fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/458287068/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/458289288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3450#issuecomment-458289288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3450","id":458289288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI4OTI4OA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T20:29:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T20:29:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ConcurrencyPractitioner \r\n\r\n> Ok, there are some kinks in my understanding.
