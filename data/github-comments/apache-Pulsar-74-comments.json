totally agree with you! I think this feature is better suited at broker side, first reason as you said, would be simplicity and much less code on the overall pulsar project. Second reason is clock dependent at back end side instead at client side, giving more flexibility to an administrator. Third reason would be to save a lot of I/O wasted for delivering messages not expired.\r\n\r\nThis pr as is, the only thing that adds at client side is the ability to pass an optional parameter (receiver delay) to the broker, which is a period of time to let the broker do the calculation of which messages are expired.\r\nIf all of you agrees to go on with this pr I'm able to add this parameter to the rest of the clients, maybe on a dedicated pr?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there is one thing we need to solve before going on with this pr, as @codelipenghui said, publish time is client-generated, we need to change this in order to set this parameter at broker level to use it in a safer way.

There are some other design features for auto tiering:\r\n1. Retention policy, describes a policy about how much data to retain within a stream. This is similar with what Pulsar has done to let customer configure how data was migrated to low tier storage.\r\n2. Scaling policy, describes if and under what circumstances a stream should `automatically` scale its number of segments. This is a bit more complicated: the controller monitors traffic of stream segment writing requests, if some thresholds have been reached, it will decide how to scale. There are two types of traffic reports that can be received for segments. First type identifies if a segment should be scaled up (split) and second type identifies if a segment should be scaled down. For segments eligible for scale up, controller immediately posts request for segment scale up in the request stream for request event processor to process. However, for scale down, Controller needs to wait for at least two neighboring segments to become eligible for scale down. This auto scaling could be seen [here](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/blob/master/documentation/src/docs/pravega-concepts.md#elastic-streams-auto-scaling) with more detail.\r\n![Uploading 图片.png…](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pravega/pravega/master/documentation/src/docs/img/segment.split.merge.overtime.new.png)\r\n\r\n@sijie I notice that Pravega will also be presented at Flink Forward in the same room, just after your presentation, perhaps you could get something more face by face :) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/448491885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/448494462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3214#issuecomment-448494462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3214","id":448494462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODQ5NDQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-19T07:21:04Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T07:21:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@yingfeng \r\n\r\n> Retention policy, \r\n\r\nit is already supported in Pulsar.
