How can this PR be tested? I am open to ideas. At the moment I have done some successful manual tests.\r\n\r\nIt could be out of the scope of this PR but, do you think it makes sense to have an end-to-end test for Zeppelin on Kubernetes?\r\nLooks like there're ways to run Kubernetes cluster in the Github Action environment (e.g. https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kind-kubernetes-in-docker-action) and It may help reduce things that are not covered by the automated tests, such as,\r\n\r\n- Dependency library sync when Zeppelin server and interpreter runs on a different host (this PR)\r\n- Interpreter lifecycle on Kubernetes (creating/destroying pod, service, etc)\r\n- Container image
