With zip files you can store .so lib files and resources file in a single deployable unit. \r\n\r\nIf I read the OSGi correctly, Celix is currently not following the OSGi spec. The spec talks about bundle resources:\r\nhttps://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.lifecycle.html#i3258563\r\nAnd it talks about persistence storage:\r\nhttps://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.lifecycle.html#i1236436\r\n\r\nThe current Celix bundle cache solution provides both. This has grown this way and the primary reason is that you need to extract the bundle zip files before you can use the resources (especially the so files, dlopen does not work in a zip file).\r\nIf I could start over, I would have handled bundles as (read only) dirs instead of zip files.\r\n\r\nI think the way forward is the first split the cache and storage. If I am correct Celix only uses/needs the storage in the Celix::http_admin bundle (to setup soft links to other bundle resources, because otherwise civetweb cannot provide resources from multiple bundles).\r\nFor example for the future the `celix_bundle_getEntry` still returns the bundle cache entry, but a new function (`celix_bundleContext_ getDataFile(const char*)` returns the bundle storage (if enabled).\r\n\r\nBut I also think that we can refactor the bundle cache so that this is not managed per framework instance, but on a global celix cache dir. Maybe something like `~/.cache/celix/bundles` or `~/.celix/cache/bundles/<bundle-id>`. maybe the  ID can be a hash of the zip file. Note that this also needs some (file-based?) locking mechanisme and I do not have yet experience with this. This should really save disk space and improve startup times. \r\n\r\nAn other option would be to also support bundles as dir and let the `celix_bundle_getEntry` function directly return the bundle dir (ideally as read only).  \r\n  \r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1236383556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1236657700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/441#issuecomment-1236657700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/441","id":1236657700,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5JteYk","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T07:51:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T07:51:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My gut feeling is that we shall establish a natural transformation between Celix's modeling and OSGi specs, which addresses intrinsic language differences (like java class loader) as  smooth as possible. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the system-wide global Celix cache you suggested seems to me the right way to go. And indeed, file locking is needed to share the cache between multiple Celix framework instances. If we want to build cache management into the Celix framework instead of delegating it to a separate command like `dpkg`, then we have to deal with the annoying interaction between POSIX advisory lock and multi-threading: https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/e04c9f4b33521a99388ce27eb46a0947fda44a26/src/os_unix.c#L1027\r\n\r\nAs for the structure of the cache , I guess we can steal some idea from conan's design? Something like `~/.celix/bundles/<bundle_name>/<bundle_version>/<hash>`  will permit multiple versions of the same bundle live happily together. I suggest we keep per framework private cache to do some minimal bookkeeping like which version of which bundles is installed for the current framework instance. Of course, any unzipped bundle exists solely in the gloabal Celix bundle, and the private cache merely reference into it for real bundle resource. Maybe the private cache can also serve as private storage, which is both readable and writable, in the contrary to the read-only global cache? Before we refine Celix's modeling to make it align with OSGi specs, I cannot answer this question.\r\n\r\nWith such a modeling in place, we can develop a very useful notion of general APP for embedded Linux. Such an APP can run in one of the two modes:\r\n\r\n- **Standalone Mode**, the bundles implementing the business logic and all their dependencies are contained in a Celix container, running in a separate Docker conainer, or any light weight homemade sandbox. \r\n- **Plugin Mode**, the app bundles and all their dependencies are running with other bundles in a monolithic process.\r\n\r\nUse standalone mode, we can constrain each app's resource usage, while the plugin mode will be valuable for highly resource constrained environments. The user can switch between two modes easily. Supporting multiple-version of the same bundle is essential for this usage, since APPs have very different release schedules and thus are likely to depend on different versions of the same bundle. The global cache guarantees that for any specific version of any specific bundle, there is only one unzipped bundle system-wide. That means though each app may carry all its dependencies, there will be no duplication system-wide.\r\n\r\nNow, I really should find a place to sit down, and have a good reading of the specs before any prototyping attempt.

Around 2011-2013 we did some experiment with updating the NEEDED and SONAME flags and in that experiment it did work. But updating the NEEDED/SONAME entry is difficult of the string size needs to increased, so for the experiment we only updated NEEDED to something small (libfoo->ab1, libbar->ab2, etc). \r\nIf I remember correctly we did not follow up this approach, because we had bigger things to tackle. But I agree if we can tackle this we are creating something \"magical\" for the C/C++ word :).\r\n\r\nThis should indeed be done in the resolving of a bundle and ideally be done by a resolver. There is a resolver in Celix, but that is outdated and not something I have touched(https://github.com/apache/celix/blame/master/libs/framework/src/resolver.c).

Given 'mv' is fairly cheap when within the same filesystem, the situation is nearly ideal.\r\n\r\nYes, for unpacking and then moving a staging area will work.  I think the challenge is more in how to decide if a bundle does not need to be extracted, because it is already in the cache. This can be done with a hash and hash index, but maybe a hash is already too expensive.\r\n\r\nAn other option could be to only extract the MANIFEST.MF file from a bundle and use that to see if the rest needs to be extracted. This can work efficiently (also memory wise) if the bundle are created with the java jar command, because a jar is technically a zip file but ensure that the MANIFEST is the first entry in the zip file.

Around 2011-2013 we did some experiment with updating the NEEDED and SONAME flags and in that experiment it did work. But updating the NEEDED/SONAME entry is difficult of the string size needs to increased, so for the experiment we only updated NEEDED to something small (libfoo->ab1, libbar->ab2, etc).\r\n> If I remember correctly we did not follow up this approach, because we had bigger things to tackle. But I agree if we can tackle this we are creating something \"magical\" for the C/C++ word :).\r\n\r\nUnlike `chrpath`, `patchelf` has no such limitation.

Unlike MacOS, on Linux we don't have two-level namespace, and thus have no way to reference a specific symbol from a specific shared object.  Given that such imported/exported library can only be used within the Celix framework, why not just export its functionality as service at the first place?\r\n\r\nI also checked nOSGi's implementation, which is discussed in [nOSGi](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.475.4526&rep=rep1&type=pdf), and implemented in [nOSGi - A POSIX-Compliant Native OSGi Framework for C/C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nosgi/). They use libelf to modify shared object's DT_NEEDED entry in the bundle cache. This is unacceptable in our approach: several framework instances mean several binary copies of the same shared object. The global cache should be read-only, and the per-framework cache should reference the unique shared objects in the global cache.\r\n\r\nI think there is a way of implementing the perfect import/export mechanism without above restrictions: use the dark Linux magic `man 7 rtld-audit`: \r\n\r\n```\r\n   la_symbind*()\r\n\r\n       The return value of la_symbind32() and la_symbind64() is the address to which control should be passed after the function returns.  If the auditing library is simply monitoring symbol bindings, then it should return sym->st_value.  A different value may be returned  if\r\n       the library wishes to direct control to an alternate location.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTheoretically, we can get complete control of dynamic symbol resolution, bind any symbol reference to wherever we want. The biggest advantage is that we don't have to use any external tools to modify the binary, each framework instance (assuming one instance per process) has complete control at runtime.

I we can still provide a Celix version for MacOS that does not support import/export of symbols IMO that is acceptable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1255108827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1255122037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/441#issuecomment-1255122037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/441","id":1255122037,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5Kz6R1","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T14:37:10Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T14:40:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > think the challenge is more in how to decide if a bundle does not need to be extracted, because it is already in the cache.\r\n> \r\n> .zip is just like .deb package: once installed into our global cache, the zip file is of no use and can be safely removed from the system. Each framework instance has its own private bundle cache, which does nothing but does bookkeeping like which bundle installed for this framework instance. When `celix_bundleContext_installBundle` is invoked, it just install in the private cache a reference to the real bundle directory in the global cache. Before a bundle can be installed into a framework instance's private cache, it must be first installed into the global cache via a separate tool like `dkpg` or a new Celix API `celix_system_installBundle`.\r\n> \r\n> Maybe we should call this global cache the System Bundle Store instead. Each working bundle exists uniquely in this store in unzipped format.\r\n\r\nAh ok, now I understand the dkpg idea. Although technically good, I do then worry if we also need some support some repository system, which can be used to download/intstall bundle zips.\r\nBecause in the current setup bundles are installed as zip, and if they also need to be installed in the \"System Bundle Store\" - per users - this default means some disk space overhead. \r\n\r\nMaybe it then also an idea to let the `install_celix_bundle` cmake command installed unzipped bundle in a already \"System Bundle Store\" complaint directory structure and allow a - per user and system wide - celix config file configure 0 or more \"System Bundle Store\" locations (something like podman's registries.conf).  IMO this should be feasible, especially because the bundle store should be read only.

I will look into this.\r\n\r\nNevermind that conflicts with `const char*` template infer. \r\nFor now I will keep this if c++17 switch. I also prefer to use literal string types instead of templates for readability/usability.\r\n

We have already been hurt by this kind of bugs, e.g. #404 and #426. \r\nMemory alignment is another major source of bugs, though I have not encountered them in Celix. \r\nTesting on ARM/RISC-V will help catch them.\r\n\r\nConan could be very handy for cross tool-chains  management and cross-compiling, and Qemu might be helpful for local debugging. \r\nHow about we open an issue to have a good discussion of the work flow, especially of the local one.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing #441, I will be happy to help adding such support to our CI if it has not happened then.\r\n\r\n> And it there any benefits looking to musl libc and/or dietlibc?\r\n\r\nSupporting multiple libc will help improve Celix's portability. I think musl libc is a good choice. As for dietlibc, I have no knowledge of it. If supporting tiny Linux is one of Celix's aims, then supporting dietlibc will be no harm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1334710661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1336336911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/450#issuecomment-1336336911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/450","id":1336336911,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5PpuIP","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-04T07:02:39Z","updated_at":"2022-12-04T07:05:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
