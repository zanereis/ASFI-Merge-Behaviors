going to merge this PR, as it's an improvement for the current approach.\r\n\r\nI have one naive question. Before we dive into MVCC, or try to improve the ZK-based approach, have we consider adding a command \"refresh function registry\", so that users enforce that function registry across the entire cluster is consistent? I remember someone (probably @amansinha100 ) once brought up this idea.\r\n\r\n1. How often would user run into the issue caused by inconsistency of functions in different drillbit?  Sounds like we are adding non-negligible overhead for other queries which do not use dynamic UDF or overloaded functions, just for the sake of resolving issues of function inconsistency.   \r\n2. Drill's function resolution logic not only happens in planning but also execution time (due to the fact schema may be known in execution time). This means the function registry could be checked multiple times during the query lifetime.  Adding overhead to each check would slow down the entire query.\r\n3. With the \"refresh function registry\" command, use has a way to ensure function registry is consistent after issuing such command. We could tell user that drillbit could run into various of problems, before run \"refresh function registry\", therefore it's always recommend to run such command after user creates a new UDF.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283572667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283574372","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/745#issuecomment-283574372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/745","id":283574372,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzU3NDM3Mg==","user":{"login":"jinfengni","id":5742011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDIwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5742011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni","html_url":"https://github.com/jinfengni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T07:07:40Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T07:07:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283574372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283627981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/701#issuecomment-283627981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/701","id":283627981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzYyNzk4MQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T11:23:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T11:23:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jinfengni \r\n\r\n1. Depending on how often udfs are added, we don't expect it to happen often though. But you are correct about the overhead for the queries that do not use dynamic UDFs.\r\n2. You are right, function registry can be checked several times and can slow down the entire query, It's hard to say how much performance will be slow down, as it may depend on many factors, like number of parallel queries, number of not exact functions in query, ZK time of response and so on).\r\n3. Refresh function registry function is considered but as part of MVCC. It could help in current approach but still it could not guarantee that after issuing the refresh command all drillbits will sync their local function registries with remote one, unless refresh function would wait for all drillbits to send their confirmation that sync was done. But what if one of drillbits fails to sync, should refresh function have retry mechanism or fail immediately, how long it could take the user to wait for refresh command to finish execution etc. With MVCC refresh command would need to guarantee that only current drillbit is in sync and all above questions will be dropped (more in MVCC doc).\r\n\r\nAnyway, you are totally right that current approach is covering only the gap with function overloading and not optimal and may slow down the queries. Having refresh command might partially solve the problem as well but might have some issues to be covered. So it's better to dive in MVCC for the most optimal implementation. \r\n\r\nRegarding this pull request I don't have strong feelings if it should be merged or not. Yes, it would solve problem with functions overloading but it may impact performance but it's hard to say how much since many factors may have influence.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283627981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283695547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/701#issuecomment-283695547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/701","id":283695547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzY5NTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"jinfengni","id":5742011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDIwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5742011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni","html_url":"https://github.com/jinfengni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinfengni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T16:04:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T16:04:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva ,\r\n\r\nRegarding your 3rd comment, we probably can discuss further once you have the design.

The key goals are that a function, once registered, is guaranteed to be available on all Drillbits once it is visible to any particular Foreman. Without this guarantee of consistency, DUDFs become non-determinstic and will cause customer problems.\r\n\r\nWe do have a \"refresh\" operation: registering a DUDF updates ZK which sends updates to each node. The problem is the race condition. I register a UDF foo() on node A. I run a query from that same node. If my query happens to hit node B before the ZK notification, the query will fail. Our goal is that such failure cannot happen, hence the need for a \"pull\" model to augment the ZK-based \"push\" model.\r\n\r\nA manual \"update\" would have the same issue unless we synchronized the update across all nodes. Also, the only way to ensure that DUDFs are available is to issue an update after adding each DUDF. But, if we did that, we might as well make the DUDF registration itself synchronous across all nodes.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the node synchronization does not handle the race condition in which a new node comes up right after a synchronization starts. We'd have to ensure that the new node reads the proper state from ZK. We can do that if we first update ZK, then do synchronization to all nodes, then update ZK with the fact that all nodes are aware of the DUDF. \r\n\r\nWithout the \"two-phase\" process, our new node can come up, learn of the new DUDF and issue a query using the DUDF without some nodes having been notified of the synchronization.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a difficult area. Relying on the well-known semantics of MVCC makes the problems much easier to solve.\r\n\r\nSo, the question here is whether it is worth checking in this partial solution for 1.10, or just leave the problem open until a complete solution is available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283743476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/283809646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/456#issuecomment-283809646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/456","id":283809646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzgwOTY0Ng==","user":{"login":"StevenMPhillips","id":3360419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjA0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3360419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenMPhillips","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMPhillips/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T22:55:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T22:55:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There was a brief discussion on the drill-dev mailing list a few days after this PR was posted.

I have done some investigation and found out that implicit casts for nested loop join are already included during materialization.\r\nJoin condition is transformed into FunctionCall [1] which is later on materialized using ExpressionTreeMaterializer [2]. \r\n`ExpressionTreeMaterializer.visitFunctionCall` includes section which implicit casts [3].\r\nActually these casts are more enhanced that during hash and merge joins.\r\nFor example, during hash and merge joins only casts between numeric types, date and timestamp, varchar and varbinary are supported, i.e.\r\njoin by int and varchar columns won't be performed. The following error will be returned: `Join only supports implicit casts between 1. Numeric data\r\n 2. Varchar, Varbinary data 3. Date, Timestamp data Left type: INT, Right type: VARCHAR.
