\r\n\r\nFirstly, I apologize for the  delay on this, but I finally spent  some time on this and here's what I found -- \r\n\r\n-  I don't really see anything within MyFaces that  matches the Namespace changes done in Mojarra. \r\n     - No hits for [NamespaceContext](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/namespace/NamespaceContext.html?is-external=true) in MyFaces. \r\n\r\n- There doesn't appear to be any Namespace handing within the MyFaces implementation. The only thing that  matters from the faces-config declaration is the [version](https://github.com/apache/myfaces/blob/3.0.x/impl/src/main/java/org/apache/myfaces/config/impl/digester/DigesterFacesConfigUnmarshallerImpl.java#L55)?  I didn't experience any errors or warnings when just using **< faces-config version=\"3.0\" >**.\r\n\r\nThe code for handling the faces-config isn't very straightforward, but I saw that the parsing is accomplished  by [DigesterFacesConfigUnmarshallerImpl](https://github.com/apache/myfaces/blob/3.0.x/impl/src/main/java/org/apache/myfaces/config/impl/digester/DigesterFacesConfigUnmarshallerImpl.java#L512) which is called from  [here](https://github.com/apache/myfaces/blob/3.0.x/impl/src/main/java/org/apache/myfaces/config/DefaultFacesConfigurationProvider.java#L437). \r\n\r\nShould I first  implement something relating to the NamespaceContext, but I'm not sure if it's necessary?\r\n\r\nLast of all, I also don't think this PR needs the impl/src/main/conf/META-INF/standard-faces-config-base.xml change?
