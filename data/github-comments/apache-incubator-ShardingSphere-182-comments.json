This problem should have nothing to do with sharding not working.It causes the transaction not to take effect.The scenarios I use are read-write separation and data desensitization.I just see that your example has the same problem as mine. Let's ask if you have solved it.And I have solved some of the above problems. The container injection of transaction manager is completed.The results are as follows：\r\n`Creating a new SqlSession\r\nRegistering transaction synchronization for SqlSession [org.apache.ibatis.session.defaults.DefaultSqlSession@70f29b72]\r\n2021-02-03 16:32:15.247  INFO [trading-order-extend,,,] 9800 --- [    Test worker] ShardingSphere-SQL                       : Logic SQL: SELECT count(id) FROM order_service_obj\r\n2021-02-03 16:32:15.247  INFO [trading-order-extend,,,] 9800 --- [    Test worker] ShardingSphere-SQL                       : SQLStatement: MySQLSelectStatement(limit=Optional.empty, lock=Optional.empty)\r\n2021-02-03 16:32:15.248  INFO [trading-order-extend,,,] 9800 --- [    Test worker] ShardingSphere-SQL                       : Actual SQL: replica-ds ::: SELECT count(id) FROM order_service_obj\r\nReleasing transactional SqlSession [org.apache.ibatis.session.defaults.DefaultSqlSession@70f29b72]\r\nTransaction synchronization committing SqlSession [org.apache.ibatis.session.defaults.DefaultSqlSession@70f29b72]\r\nTransaction synchronization deregistering SqlSession [org.apache.ibatis.session.defaults.DefaultSqlSession@70f29b72]\r\nTransaction synchronization closing SqlSession [org.apache.ibatis.session.defaults.DefaultSqlSession@70f29b72]`。I hope it can help you to solve our common problems.\r\nMy solution is as follows：\r\n`private SpringManagedTransactionFactory getTransactionFactory(DataSource dataSource) {\r\n        SpringManagedTransactionFactory transactionFactory = new SpringManagedTransactionFactory();\r\n        transactionFactory.newTransaction(dataSource, TransactionIsolationLevel.REPEATABLE_READ,true);\r\n        return transactionFactory;\r\n    }`\r\nThe transaction manager generated by method ‘getTransactionFactory’ will be assigned to the properties of the mybatissqlsessionfactorybean object.This operation can solve the \"JDBC Connection [org.apache.shardingsphere.driver.jdbc.core.connection.ShardingSphereConnection@41f00c4b] will not be managed by Spring\" problem.\r\nAnd @ transactional (rollback for) to the implementation class of the service= Exception.class ）It can solve the “SqlSession [org.apache.ibatis.session.defaults.DefaultSqlSession@6049f52d] was not registered for synchronization because synchronization is not active” problem。\r\nBut I don't know why it keeps creating and destroying sqlsessions when executing SQL.It may be related to multiple data sources. Maybe so. Hope to get the author's solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/772350379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/772360500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9291#issuecomment-772360500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9291","id":772360500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjM2MDUwMA==","user":{"login":"JiekerTime","id":76552510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTUyNTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76552510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime","html_url":"https://github.com/JiekerTime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiekerTime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T09:21:05Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T09:21:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi~ @lazyboyl  ~ Thanks for your feedback!\r\nIn order to solve the problem conveniently, I have a few questions to confirm：\r\nWhat operating system are you using?

Even if you are using a Linux system, it is recommended to temporarily turn off case sensitivity.\r\n\r\nAbout the SQL statement, your question is similar to #9270. \r\nIn our 5.0.0-apha, if join and ‘*’ are involved at the same time, it may cause some data loss problems in the result merging.We also found this problem and fixed it in the latest version (master branch).\r\nMy suggestion is to avoid using ‘*’ as much as possible, or try to install the master branch, or wait for our upcoming release version!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/772975841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/773001797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9292#issuecomment-773001797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9292","id":773001797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzAwMTc5Nw==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T03:32:43Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T03:32:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wuzhiwei18

So please take it easy. If any confusion, we can discuss it and figure it out.\r\n\r\nI am unsure whether I got your point wholly. However, the primary blocker you met looks like the function of `ShardingSphereDataSource` (Virtual DB) and the `Map<String, DataSource>` (Actual DBs) from `conn.getDataSourceMap()`.\r\n\r\n### Map<String, DataSource> for setting up test env\r\nWe use all the actual data sources to prepare initial data for databases. There is unnecessary to consider `ShardingSphereDataSource`, therefore I think `initTable()` has no critical issues. Just use them to execute the corresponding initialization scrip.\r\n\r\n### ShardingSphereDataSource for test\r\nAfter having the expected test databases, we will use `ShardingSphereDataSource` to test `logic SQLs` in UT.\r\nThis phase's key point is to write the configuration file, which means configure logic DB, table, columns with these actual ones. Definitely, this part of the work mainly needs your deep understanding of different configurations.  If you have any questions about this one, please contact me.\r\nCould you figure out which one is your concern? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/773772327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/773777051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9294#issuecomment-773777051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9294","id":773777051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3Mzc3NzA1MQ==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-05T04:21:02Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T04:21:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`Type` means this table is a single table, broadcast table, sharding table or binding tables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/773777051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/773779024","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9291#issuecomment-773779024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9291","id":773779024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3Mzc3OTAyNA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-05T04:28:03Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T04:28:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @lazyboyl ,\r\n\r\nI got your point, and thanks for your feedback.
