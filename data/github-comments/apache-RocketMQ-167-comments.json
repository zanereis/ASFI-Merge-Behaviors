I would like to consult you on the following questions:您好，我正在复制和增强 jraft 实验。我想就以下问题咨询您：\r\n> \r\n> 1. In your experiment, are the controller, broker, etc. all deployed on the same machine? Because I noticed that you modified the code to use different ports such as localhost:9770, 9771, 9772, etc.在您的实验中，控制器、代理等是否都部署在同一台机器上？因为我注意到您修改了代码以使用不同的端口，例如 localhost：9770、9771、9772 等。\r\n> 2. So if I have three distributed controllers, will they all expose ports 9880 and 9770 to the broker by default? Does the broker need any configuration for this?因此，如果我有三个分布式控制器，它们是否默认都向代理公开端口 9880 和 9770？代理是否需要对此进行任何配置？\r\n> 3. Could you provide a complete sample configuration file for the proxy and broker? I would like to keep the parameters mostly the same.您能否为代理和代理提供完整的示例配置文件？我想保持参数基本相同。\r\n\r\n1 yes\r\n2 yes, broker  only change controllerAddr={NS_IP1}:9770,{NS_IP2}:9770,{NS_IP3}:9770\r\n3 ns (with
