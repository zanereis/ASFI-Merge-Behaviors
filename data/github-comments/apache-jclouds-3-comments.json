Guava is part of the public API of the project (methods which take functions etc) so it is important to support a range there.  (Also Guava seems to keep having CVE's against it so it is frequently version-bumped.)\r\n\r\nPreviously a range of Guava (and okio) packages were allowed, so this is a regression.  I note the `TODO` comments in 7b5c2ae529bee0ed3528df9bc479edde46d9695f about this.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n    <guava.version>22.0</guava.version>\r\n    <!-- TODO: this has to be addressed in another feature -->\r\n    <guava.osgi.import>com.google.common.*;version=\"[22.0,30.0.0)\"</guava.osgi.import>\r\n\r\n    <guice.version>4.2.3</guice.version>\r\n    <gson.version>2.8.5</gson.version>\r\n\r\n    <okhttp.version>2.2.0</okhttp.version>\r\n    <!-- TODO: this has to be addressed in another feature -->\r\n    <okio.osgi.import>okio;version=\"[1.2.0,1.3)\"</okio.osgi.import>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was introduced by the switch from `maven-jar-plugin` to `bnd-maven-plugin` in 8ac994c2b5d509ca2877efdd77c35881d58ac3e3 as part of this PR.  Obviously the switch to bnd means the import-package range instruction needs to be configured in a different way.\r\n\r\nIs that in the works?\r\n\r\nWe are blocked from using newer jclouds until this is resolved, as is anyone trying to use it in an OSGi context unless they can use the exact Guava version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/753944755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/753996103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/78#issuecomment-753996103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/78","id":753996103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Mzk5NjEwMw==","user":{"login":"gaul","id":848247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul","html_url":"https://github.com/gaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-04T14:10:42Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T14:10:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ahgittin I feared that this would impact downstream consumers.

Increasing to this version number was not the subject of the current branch.\r\n\r\nTo avoid backward compatibility problems between Guice and Guava (e.g. Guice 4.2.3 -> Guava 24) this means that the version of Guava integrated in JClouds must be at least version 27.1. Guice puts this in its dependencies. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, consumers (JClouds, as well as consumers of JClouds) should take this minimum barrier into account.\r\n\r\nResolution\r\nTo understand the resolution, please consider the following previously unmerged feature.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/86\r\n\r\nIn order to add a Guava verison range to the bundles rolled out by JClouds, the following import rule is added in the BND Configuration of the Project Module.\r\n\r\n```\r\nImport Package: \\\r\n    com.google.common.*;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\", \\\r\n    okio.*;version=\"[1.2.0,1.3)\", \\\r\n    *\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the output of each JClouds module that uses Guava (and there are some) the configuration to the range version is observed. The bnd built into the JClouds project modules acts as a base of other bnd configurations, and should also apply in the Lab and Co repositories. Adjusted artefacts only become valid when a release is available or the build of these repositories is triggered again.\r\n\r\n**Output - Core Module**\r\n```\r\nImport package:\r\n   com.google.common.base;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   com.google.common.cache;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   com.google.common.collect;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   ...\r\n   com.google.gson;version=\"[2.8,3)\",\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output - Blobstore Module**\r\n\r\n```\r\nImport package:\r\n   com.google.common.base;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   com.google.common.collect;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   com.google.common.hash;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   ...\r\n   com.google.inject;version=\"[1.4,2)\",\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOki version range\r\nThe okhttp dependency requires okio version 1.2. The ok* libraries respectively the dependencies used in these libraries do not have OSGi instructions. For this reason, the previously integrated configuration is used. \r\n\r\nLocal tests show that the import directive can also be set globally, see above. An explicit specification in the bnd file of the JClouds okHTTP module is not useful because this JClouds module also uses Guava.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output - OkHTTP Module**\r\n\r\n```\r\nImport package:\r\n   com.google.common.base;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   com.google.common.collect;version=\"[27.1,30.1.0)\",\r\n   okio;version=\"[1.2.0,1.3)\",\r\n   com.google.inject;version=\"[1.4,2)\",\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: In the following feature, the version of the \"ok\" framework has been significantly increased.  Extensive adjustments are also performed.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it should be noted that the import policy in the okio will probably have to be removed again because standalone OSGi metadata may be provided.\r\n\r\nCan we please continue the discussion in the following feature.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/86\r\n\r\nThx!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/757345535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/757559706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/78#issuecomment-757559706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/78","id":757559706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NzU1OTcwNg==","user":{"login":"geomacy","id":14142759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTQyNzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14142759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy","html_url":"https://github.com/geomacy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geomacy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-10T23:02:54Z","updated_at":"2021-01-10T23:02:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the extensive notes @gurkerl83.

I appreciate breaking out the commits and I follow the logic from the detailed messages.  However I am concerned with upgrading the Guava version:\r\n\r\n> Note: In an OSGi runtime, Guice version 4.2.3 expects Guava with an exact version of 27.1-jre. For now, higher versions of Guava are not possible.\r\n\r\nA later commit message says:\r\n\r\n> The version of Guice built into JClouds is 4.2.3. Increasing to this version number was not the subject of the current branch.\r\n>\r\n> To avoid backward compatibility problems between Guice and Guava (e.g. Guice 4.2.3 -> Guava 24) this means that the version of Guava integrated in JClouds must be at least version 27.1. Guice puts this in its dependencies.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, jclouds supported Guava 22-30, or at least we believed that this range worked.  Is it possible to continue this support, possibly by downgrading Guice?  I am not opposed to upgrading but I want to understand if there are other options since Guava upgrades have previously caused user complaints and rollbacks.\r\n\r\nAlso the last message for okio confuses me:\r\n\r\n> In the following feature, the version of the \"ok\" framework has been significantly increased.

Perhaps the easiest approach is to disable error-prone on Java 8 via profiles?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/803514740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/803521723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/101#issuecomment-803521723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/101","id":803521723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzUyMTcyMw==","user":{"login":"gaul","id":848247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul","html_url":"https://github.com/gaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-21T06:41:47Z","updated_at":"2021-03-21T06:41:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Alternatively we can just specify openjdk11 for travis.yml.

This has been in the POM file for a long time and was copy-and-pasted from the Error-Prone project page. This is precisely the kind of situation to avoid; when developers leave the project, the expertise gets lost, and complex configuration fragments remain in a project for a long time.  \r\n\r\nAlthough many of the rules included by the Error-Prone plugin are also supported by development tools such as IntelliJ, there is still a permission base to use the plugin.\r\n\r\nTo further minimize the project module's configuration, I tend to put the configuration of the plugin or the configuration of the Maven compiler plugin into a settings.xml and call Maven accordingly. The configuration of the compiler options could be passed as a property to the Maven compiler plugin. To support different JDKs, perhaps create additional settings.xml files. \r\n\r\nDue to more JDK variants' support, the profiles will grow; a separation at this level dedicated settings.xml files tailored to one platform would prevent a configuration mess.\r\n\r\nIn any case, efforts to improve the build setup should be geared towards reducing the build configuration's size.\r\n\r\nThx!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/803575347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/808488282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/63#issuecomment-808488282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/63","id":808488282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODQ4ODI4Mg==","user":{"login":"mahirkabir","id":5474055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzQwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5474055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir","html_url":"https://github.com/mahirkabir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahirkabir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-26T20:22:45Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T20:22:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @gaul , a JIRA issue has been created at - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-1570 .
