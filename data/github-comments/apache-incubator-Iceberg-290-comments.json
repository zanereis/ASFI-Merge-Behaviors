Although we told them about the table property or the Netflix custom spark conf per table, many still wished `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` applied so that they didn't make any change to the workflows.\r\n\r\nThus I propose honoring this conf after per-table settings and before SPLIT_SIZE_DEFAULT. Please note this does not prevent users from trying the more advanced Iceberg per-table tunings. Here is the order:\r\n\r\n1. DataFrame read option `split-size`\r\n2. (Not in this PR, Netflix internal) Spark conf `spark.netflix.(db).(table).target-size` override for a table\r\n3. table property `read.split.target-size`\r\n4. Spark conf `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`\r\n5. default constant value SPLIT_SIZE_DEFAULT in Iceberg repo. \r\n\r\nDetails in

If the Files metadata table has no tuples of {data: a} then there is no partition of data = a.\r\n\r\nAfter truncate(`DeleteFiles::deleteFromRowFilter`) the partition `data=a`,  I did a query to check the \"files\" metadata table using 1.3.1&1.41, and both didn't find the `data = a`  file path.  And The partitions metadata table will show the empty partition `data=a` in 1.4.1, but 1.3.1 didn't  show this empty partition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Now you can have a partition with no rows, this would happen if you have a file for {data:a} but also have delete files which negate all rows in that partition. \r\n\r\nI extracted the key code snippet from the unit test:\r\n```\r\n   // here delete a partition data \r\n    Expression finalExp = Expressions.in(\"data\", \"a\");\r\n    DeleteFiles delete = table.newDelete();\r\n    delete.deleteFromRowFilter(finalExp);\r\n    delete.commit();\r\n```\r\nFrom the code snippet, I think we acutually did a metadata level delete and no delete files generation. I didnt find the delete files.  Am i right?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1785506472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1785518691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8892#issuecomment-1785518691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8892","id":1785518691,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85qbNpj","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-30T15:53:57Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T15:53:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @hussein-awala for taking the time to create this PR, and @jbonofre, @ajantha-bhat for the review 👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1785518691/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1785524764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6799#issuecomment-1785524764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6799","id":1785524764,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85qbPIc","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-30T15:56:58Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T15:57:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nastra @aokolnychyi please let me know what you think.

At the end of the day, the catalog API takes a table identifier and returns an object. That can be table object, virtual view object, or a hybrid object (has characteristics of both table and virtual view objects). In the case of materialized view, the catalog should be able to take a view name, i.e., identifier, and return that hybrid object. So both the virtual view and storage table are addressed by the view name. That said, I am still not clear why the Iceberg spec needs to be aware of the catalog-specific table identifier. Table identifiers are not part of the Iceberg table spec, so I do not think they can make it to the materialized view spec. (Table identifier as in `catalog.db.table` should not be confused with table UUID -- the latter is part of the V2 spec which should be fine to use).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1786292375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1786382503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8467#issuecomment-1786382503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8467","id":1786382503,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85qegin","user":{"login":"jerqi","id":8159038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTkwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8159038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi","html_url":"https://github.com/jerqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-31T03:31:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T06:22:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RussellSpitzer Comments are addressed.
