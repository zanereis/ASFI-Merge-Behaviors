Only when all the icons are redrawn, you'd be allowed to integrate first API change.

The first time you draw an icon, most of the work involved is to get familiar with the drawing software etc. Once you've done a few icons, the next ones are much quicker. That's one of the reasons why I recommend doing 10-12 icons before integrating--with more experience, the later icons end up being better, and you go back and refine the first ones you drew etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/696230839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/696258499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2376#issuecomment-696258499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2376","id":696258499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjI1ODQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T17:28:13Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T17:28:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK,

Although something feels backwards about the API.  Adding new APIs (`LegacyIconLocator`) for old behaviour feels wrong.  What I suggested before a number of times, including in discussion around introduction of SVG support, was adding in an API around something like `IconLocator` for the newer options.  eg. we currently have a `resource` name which is a path. The existing behaviour handled png and gif files, with branding support.  You'd have had an optional SVG loader which handled paths looking for related SVG files, and you could have a logical icon locator that translated non-path (no slash) resource names into icons.  The icon locators could stack, so you could have first to resolve wins, or transformed locations from one pass down to the next.\r\n\r\nThe other API which we shouldn't ignore, and is already used in icon loading is ImageIO.  I also suggested at the time we look at this for SVG using the [TwelveMonkeys](https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys) plugin.  Amongst other things, ImageIO has the ability to specify target resolution, which I believe is something missing in our current support - we might use or at least adapt the API from that. eg.

Overall seems good to me.

However I believe it is an orthogonal problem which shall not be blocked by the way we organize our icons (CCing @lkishalmi) - if we are just replacing `wait.png` by `wait.svg` we should go on.\r\n\r\nOne enhancement has however recently come to my mind: We could use [@StaticResource annotation](https://bits.netbeans.org/12.0/javadoc/org-netbeans-api-annotations-common/org/netbeans/api/annotations/common/StaticResource.html) - it wasn't there when people started to copy `wait.png` to thirty different places, but it was later designed to avoid doing that. Nobody just had enough incentives to fix all the copies. Could we use the switch to SVG as an opportunity to cleanup the copies?\r\n\r\nJust find a common module all other depend on and place the `wait.svg` in there. Let's suppose it ends up in `org/openide/awt/resources/wait.svg`. Then let all other modules declare a dependency on the resource by:\r\n```java\r\n@StaticResource\r\nprivate static final String WAIT_SVG = \"org/openide/awt/resources/wait.svg\";\r\n```\r\nThat basically forms a \"compile time\" API, as the annotation's processor is going to fail if somebody removes the icon. No need for too many copies. Enough to share it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/697295159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/697490132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2395#issuecomment-697490132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2395","id":697490132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NzQ5MDEzMg==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-23T14:55:31Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T14:55:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1.
