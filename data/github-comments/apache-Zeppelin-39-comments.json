They are not major, but are necessary.  There are also some revisions to the build system in spark-dependencies and spark.  I don't _think_ those are necessary, but they do resolve some spark-building issues that people email the list about. \n\nRegarding 5 (licenses): the code under r/R is ASF.  Except that a good chunk of it is based on code that is BSD licensed (rscala).  (I.e., its a derivative work licensed under ASF but with portions licensed under BSD.)  I'm not sure how the license should appear in those cases?  Also, some of those files don't have licenses because they're automatically generated during the R-package build process; they're really the output of a build rather than the input.  \n\nI will need a day or two to turn to these -- I am also going to try not to respond further until the moratorium is up. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/181672499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/181674445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-181674445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":181674445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTY3NDQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T02:31:00Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T02:31:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bzz Thank you for your attention and efforts to move this forward!\n\nI'm happy to do all the required work (but I'm really just stuck on CI).  \n\nI think you have hit the issues.   Let me give the status of a few:\n1. (Other modules.)  There are small changes to spark/ that are necessary.  There are also changes to the pom.xml's in spark, spark-dependencies, and the main one.  I don't _think_ they're necessary, but they do resolve some persistent issues people have had building with different variants of spark. \n2.  (Rebase.)  This:  https://github.com/elbamos/Zeppelin-With-R  Is up-to-date with 0.5.6.  I will bring this branch up to date with current master. \n3.  (Docs.)  Docs are included with the URL above and will be in the rebased PR. \n4.  (CI) Thank you!\n5.  (Licenses.)  The code under r/ is ASF, but some files are derived from BSD-licensed rscala code.  Also, some files under r/ are not code.  They're generated during the R-package build process, so they don't have licenses at the top.  I think this is some of what Jongyoul was on about.  I'm happy to take care of this however, but just need to know how it should look. \n6.  (pom.xml formatting.)  Can you clarify what's required?  \n7.  (Source formatting.)  Will-do.\n\nAlso - we should probably change the build so that R is either a module, or builds only if R is present.  Something also needs to be done so it gets included in the binary build.  \n\nI will work on this over the next few days, but I'm trying to respect the moratorium. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/181674445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/181706331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/701#issuecomment-181706331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/701","id":181706331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTcwNjMzMQ==","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T04:35:29Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T04:35:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@felixcheung How about moving that profile into parent's pom?

It would be proper to have  `com.databricks:spark-avro_2.10:2.0.1` instead of `com.databricks:spark-avro_2.10-2.0.1`\nThough I think there is a bug with toast notification since Zeppelin should have some message in it something like this:\n<img width=\"1190\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-02-10 at 3 08 03 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/12965175/164c5b5e-d009-11e5-9187-d3581ce004c6.png\">\nIt would be appreciated if you can share which browser you are using, and which error message you can see in logs/zeppelin-{user}-*.log when you try to save invalid maven coordinates\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182632331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182632704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/702#issuecomment-182632704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/702","id":182632704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjYzMjcwNA==","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T23:23:33Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T23:23:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ohh my god, those charts are very sexy!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182632704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182633114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/673#issuecomment-182633114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/673","id":182633114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjYzMzExNA==","user":{"login":"FRosner","id":3427394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3427394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner","html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T23:25:49Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T23:25:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for pointing this out!

and @sourav-mazumder, I really appreciate your feedback. \n\n@Leemoonsoo,\nI fixed the note permission background and wildcard placeholder issue.\n\n> So, do you have good idea to make note permission feature gracefully aware notebook portability?\n\nI am not sure how to gracefully deal with permissions when notebooks are ported to a different Zeppelin server with different user and groups. One option is to delete permission information when we port so notes are accessible to anyone (the default case). We could save permissions information in a separate file. I have created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-666 to track this issue.\n\n@sourav-mazumder,\nRegarding comment 1 and 3, I will clarify the interpreter vs target data source authorization distinction in docs/security/interpreter_authorization.md and research Apache Knox.\n\nRegarding comment 2, it is not clear to me why user and group names allowed to access notebooks should be encrypted. We are not storing any credentials and only the zeppelin process can modify note permissions when a request is made by one of the note's owners.\n\nBtw, we have deployed Zeppelin with authentication and notebook authorization at Twitter and it is working well. We are using it mainly to access Vertica, Presto and Mysql databases. The top priority now is to authenticate users to these databases. We are implementing this by asking users for their database credentials and storing them in a secure way on the Zeppelin server.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182639353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182639390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/702#issuecomment-182639390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/702","id":182639390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjYzOTM5MA==","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T23:50:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T23:50:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Those graphs in your repo are sexy too !\n\nTo be honest, I'm comparing them to the current graph options that exist in standard Zeppelin (I'm not talking about custom code to have custom graphs) and those showed by R interpreter are nice.\n\n But I'm not qualified to judge about the quality of the R interpreter or whatsoever\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182639390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182646344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/702#issuecomment-182646344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/702","id":182646344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjY0NjM0NA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T00:11:38Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T00:11:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@doanduyhai If you pull the one from my repo, it includes a demo notebook with a whole slew of them.

It's really awesome.\n\nAfter applying this PR, I wanted to leave some comments about the documentation.\n- **Authentication** section in `authentication.md` and `notebook_authorization.md` is duplicated. So,  in my opinion, `notebook_authorization.md` will be enough instead of having both. Let's remove `authentication.md` file since there is no other particular contents except this section. Then, `notebook_authorization.md` file name have to be changed, since this file will cover both **notebook authentication** and **notebook authorization**. \n- **Security Overview** section in `overview.md` and `notebook_authorization.md` is also duplicated. So, how about having only one file for this section? I think `notebook_authorization.md` will be enough.\n- Since you add a new drop-down menu \"Security\" to `_navigation.html`, the navbar is broken like below screenshot image.\n  ![screen shot 2016-02-11 at 2 20 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/12969918/b5a86b18-d0ca-11e5-88e5-5b4cc44d459e.png)\n  I think you have to modify `style.css` file for this. \n  Or, so far, we don't need to have individual section for **Zeppelin Security**. So, the fastest way for solving this problem, you can just add your `*.md` files under the **More** section. \n\nThe above comments are just my personal opinion. So, please let me know if it's different with yours : )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182728951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/182776017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/672#issuecomment-182776017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/672","id":182776017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mjc3NjAxNw==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T09:13:42Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T09:13:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@corneadoug Sorry for the late response.
