Furthermore, the unix user needs to\r\n exist on the worker.\r\n \r\n Subtasks with impersonation will still log to the same folder, except that the files they\r\n log to will have permissions changed such that only the unix user can write to it.\r\n \r\n *Default impersonation* To prevent tasks that don't use impersonation to be run with `sudo` privileges,\r\n you can set the `default_impersonation` config in `core` which sets a default user impersonate\r\n if `run_as_user` is not set.\r\n```\r\nBut I can add any pieces you think are missing, or more verbosity/detail.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/266530598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/266535894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1934#issuecomment-266535894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1934","id":266535894,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjUzNTg5NA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T19:59:34Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T19:59:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bolkedebruin I agree that it'd be nice to have these 2 distinct features as 2 PRs, but having overseen the work here they fit very nicely together since they hook in at the same spot (wrapping the subprocess execution) and have common requirements (elevating the permissions of the user running the main process)\r\n\r\nIt'd be quite a surgery to cut this and I feel like it'd be more risky.

I fully appreciate the extensiveness of your testing. My worry is more in the area when we do find issues it is very difficult for someone else to find out what is going on. Ie. these code base changes are so large it completely shifts understanding of it to a select group of people. E.g. we have this issue now with master not doing retries for failing tasks - it is hard to debug as the flow has completely changed. Just need you guys to be responsive when finding issues here and guide us through if needed I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso there seem to be some unrelated changes to what the PR describes, this really increases complexity of finding out culprits in the future and understanding why a change was there.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is for your consideration, as you know I really like the functionality!
