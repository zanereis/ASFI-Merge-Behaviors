Anyhow, we can have a discuss first.\r\n\r\nYes , that's a good idea. It's simple and straightforward. In terms of resources, I think there are two problems. The first is the spark cluster resources. As you said, it is necessary to judge whether jobs can be submitted in advance. This is for the spark cluster resources. The second resource is livy. Now the Griffin production server is actually a single point of Livy submission, Livy is batch processing at the same time, each task will have a thread to deal with, will also occupy the resources of the production server, so here should also add queue control, or submit to more servers, that is, multi-point submission.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458060043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458070025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/griffin/pull/468#issuecomment-458070025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/468","id":458070025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODA3MDAyNQ==","user":{"login":"bhlx3lyx7","id":12149769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ5NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12149769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7","html_url":"https://github.com/bhlx3lyx7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T10:12:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T10:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458070025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458070622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/griffin/pull/479#issuecomment-458070622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/479","id":458070622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODA3MDYyMg==","user":{"login":"bhlx3lyx7","id":12149769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ5NzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12149769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7","html_url":"https://github.com/bhlx3lyx7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhlx3lyx7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T10:14:07Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T10:14:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458070622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458151435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/griffin/pull/479#issuecomment-458151435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/479","id":458151435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODE1MTQzNQ==","user":{"login":"guoyuepeng","id":20692611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjkyNjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20692611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng","html_url":"https://github.com/guoyuepeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T14:25:55Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T14:25:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/458151435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":

Thanks for your comments. \r\nThe config is the default configuration from spring boot. The reason I put it to the code base because we can easily change the config based on our need. Otherwise, users even don't know what' the log library they used.\r\nIn addition to that, I removed some dependencies as they will cause the confliction in the log system.\r\n\r\nRegarding the guild, log4j2 is an open-source library and has its official website.\r\nUser can refer to the website to customize the config.  \r\nhttps://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html
