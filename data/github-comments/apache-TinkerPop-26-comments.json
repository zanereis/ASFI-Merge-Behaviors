and thanks for contributing. In general, I like the concept of this pull request, but I have some thoughts to share to get us both on the same page. I'd thought about doing this when we first decided to get authentication in place. I opted not to do it for at least a couple reasons that I can remember:\r\n\r\n1. The `Channelizer` abstraction might be enough of an abstraction. It's not complex by any means - the core of `HttpChannelizer` is 20 lines of easily readable code. If someone doesn't want basic auth, then just write a new `Channelizer` and done. Personally, I'm not sure I want to see us expand different kinds of HTTP  auth in TinkerPop so `HttpChannelizer` with basic auth seems good enough.\r\n2. The configuration system required further pollution of the root of the configuration file. It bugs me that we don't have `Channelizer` specific configurations - e.g. you had to add `httpAuthHandlerClassName` to `Settings` and that value has nothing to do with anything other than `HttpChannelizer`. If you were configured for web sockets it would just be ignored. Not saying that we don't have that issue at hand now (as I think we do), but I didn't want to continue to proliferate it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd had it in my mind that solving 2 would make 1 more palatable as something to do, but 2 hasn't come around yet and unless there is a neat way to do it, it will come in as a breaking change to the Gremlin Server configuration file. \r\n\r\nSo that's the basic history on this direction for auth configuration - thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/289203322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/289237659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/582#issuecomment-289237659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/582","id":289237659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTIzNzY1OQ==","user":{"login":"andheiberg","id":820962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDk2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/820962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg","html_url":"https://github.com/andheiberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andheiberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-25T20:31:48Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T20:31:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"no worries at all :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/289237659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/289477241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/583#issuecomment-289477241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/583","id":289477241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTQ3NzI0MQ==","user":{"login":"krlohnes","id":16802071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODAyMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16802071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes","html_url":"https://github.com/krlohnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krlohnes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T14:49:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T14:49:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You make some very good points.\r\n\r\n> The Channelizer abstraction might be enough of an abstraction.\r\n\r\nI'd thought about that a bit, but in general, I'd rather not have to rewrite (or worse, essentially copy and paste) a piece of OS code that works almost exactly like I need it to, but simply doesn't have an extension point where there could easily be one. \r\n\r\n>Personally, I'm not sure I want to see us expand different kinds of HTTP auth in TinkerPop\r\n\r\nI'm not suggesting adding additional \"out of the box\" authorization schemes, which is why I didn't commit one. I'm really only suggesting making Tinkerpop more easily extensible so users can code their own that fits with their orgs current auth schemes/security requirements. \r\n\r\n>  If you were configured for web sockets it would just be ignored\r\n\r\nI think this abstraction could be applied fairly easily to the `WebSocketsChannelizer`. There's already the `SaslAuthenticationHandler` there. I think that with a similar change to the ternary operator in the `SaslAuthenicationHandler.init` as in the HttpChannelizer.init, you could change the abstract `HttpAuthenticationHandler` class to an `AuthenticationHandler` and have the `SaslAuthenticationHandler` extend that. I could then change the config name from `httpAuthHandlerClassName` to `authHandlerClassName`. \r\n\r\n> The configuration system required further pollution of the root of the configuration file\r\n\r\nWell, it's not the _root_ of the configuration file. It's under `authentication : { ... }`. \r\n\r\nI do agree that Channelizer config would be nice to have and may follow naturally from the idea of this PR, but I think this PR is a small, iterative change that _doesn't_ break anything. \r\n\r\nI think with the change around the `WebSocketsChannelizer` (included in a new commit), the story around this becomes better. Let me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/289477241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/289530319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/569#issuecomment-289530319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/569","id":289530319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTUzMDMxOQ==","user":{"login":"dpitera","id":13453236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDUzMjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13453236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera","html_url":"https://github.com/dpitera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpitera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T17:48:25Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T17:48:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pushed changes according to previous round of comments.

Let me try to explain. It seems like we have a pluggable authentication schema already in SASL and now this pull request suggest that we make SASL pluggable. I think we just need to make the `HttpChannelizer` use SASL. Then if someone wants to do HMAC (or whatever custom security theme) they implement through SASL.

Just one weird thing that wasn't easy to see without actually working with the API - `addTraversalSource()` and `addGraph()` aren't really \"adds\" - they are \"puts\" as  calling them more than once will act as a \"replace\" operation if the key already exists. I think we want the behavior to generally be a \"replace\" and thus \"putTraversalSource()\" and \"putGraph()\" seem like better names. I suppose if an implementation wanted to limit that ability to only \"adds\" then the naming with \"put\" still makes sense as we can see with the use of `Map.put()` in unmodifiable collections.\r\n\r\nI see some other odds/ends that could use a tweak or two, but I'll just handle those things after merging as I think you have the meat of this PR in place now once you address those other comments I've made.

Right now it's at the channel level only.  That means it is independent of other authentication mechanisms for better or worse.  Permutations to consider:\r\n\r\n- needClientAuth REQUIRE, no auth handler: ssl client auth required but no logging of the client\r\n- needClientAuth REQUIRE, +auth handler: both are always required\r\n- needClientAuth OPTIONAL, no auth handler: same as NO SECURITY!\r\n- needClientAuth OPTIONAL, +auth handler: auth handler always required\r\n\r\nSo one option is to create ssl client auth's own Channel and Auth Handlers thus disallowing mixing.  One of the limitations of the current system is what information is available to the Auth handler. So another option is to add whatever information is required to pass along the fact that ssl client auth worked then the auth handler could make its own determination as to if further authentication is required.  A more complex option would be to introduce authentication chaining thus allowing multiple mechanisms and some sort of requirement scheme - required, sufficient, etc.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this PR does help or can help with any of that.   Just some food for thought...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/290512954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/290522304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/587#issuecomment-290522304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/587","id":290522304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDUyMjMwNA==","user":{"login":"robertdale","id":122206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T19:40:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T19:40:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My app tests pass.

I guess it was closer than I thought. :) Just to make sure expectations are set right, it may take some time to get this reviewed and some iterations of reviews/fixes before we can really vote on it. \r\n\r\nOne thing I'm worried about is that we don't have our GLV test framework really worked out well yet. I was hoping to get to that early in this year, but other priorities have drawn me away from that. \r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks for doing this. Very nice to see support for a language that really doesn't work on the JVM at all, i.e. no ScriptEngine support (that I know of). I sense that will produce a whole host of new concerns to GLVs that we will need to sort out.   I'll have to dust off my .NET knowledge - it's been a while since I've done anything with that.

That's why it seemed to go so quickly 😄\r\n\r\nDo you want to figure out the test framework before merging in new GLVs or can we merge it in and then adopt the framework later on? Maybe it's even an advantage to have a GLV ready that is completely independent of Java for developing the testing framework as it should be generally possible to use the framework with other languages when it works with a .NET based GLV.\r\nI also tried to to reach a good code coverage, but a common testing framework for all GLVs would be really nice of course.\r\n\r\nIf you have any .NET related problems, don't hesitate to ask. But in general I think that it is much easier to work with .NET now thanks to .NET Core which allows to do basically everything from the command line like building and testing and it's OS-independent.

One thing that may happen is that we merge both the PRs to a feature branch of this repo that TinkerPop can maintain/rebase/etc. You (and others) could in turn submit PRs against that until it's ready to merge to the release branches. This approach has the advantage that we can rig up the platform independent test suite around the existing project and the new GLVs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/293353992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
