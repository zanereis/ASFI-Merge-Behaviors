Add worker.dynamic.port to  indicate whether worker bind dynamic port or not;<br/>\n    2. Add node+port->bind-port in Assignment for tell worker's real bind port;</p>\n\n<p>    The whole process are:<br/>\n    1. Worker launch receiver, if worker.dynamic.port set as true, receiver will bind 0, or receiver will bind port specified by supervisor.slots.ports.<br/>\n    2. After receiver launched, set it's real bind port to (:bind-port worker-data);<br/>\n    3. Set up worker heartbeat thread, add (:bind-port worker-data) to executor heartbeat info, this will take (:bind-port) to nimbus;<br/>\n    4. Nimbus generate schedule table periodically:<br/>\n1) worker.dynamic.port set true: when new schedule table and cur schedule table have common in executor->node+port, nimbus will select the same part and add the corresponding node+port into node+port->bind-port. Here we does't add newly scheduled node+port into node+port->bind-port, because until worker launched receiver and finished it's first heartbeat, nimbus can know the worker's bind port;<br/>\n2) worker.dynamic.port set false: we will add all node+port in ececutor->node+port (come form new schedule table) into node+port->bind-port, with bind-port is same as port. This make the new version act exactly the same as older version when set worker.synamic.port as false.<br/>\n    5. Worker read nimbus assignment, and it will connect the worker that bind-port not null;</p>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a

I don't know about YARN, but that's how I got storm-mesos working. The problem with dynamic ports is they make topology management a lot more complex. Now it's not enough to know the worker assignments to be able to send and receive messages, you also need the workers to choose a port and broadcast it. This creates all sorts of additional failure modes that don't currently exist. If we're going to add complexity to Storm, there better be a very compelling reason for it.
