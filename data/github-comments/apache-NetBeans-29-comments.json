This requirement is obviously violated (the implementation in `SwingUtilities.java` in the JDK looks sane).\r\n\r\nBut looking at the stack trace the problem seems to be in the `ActionInvoker`. This is the code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private static void doPerformAction(Action action, final ActionInvoker.ActionRunnable r) {\r\n        assert java.awt.EventQueue.isDispatchThread() : \"Action \" + action.getClass().getName() +\r\n        \" may not be invoked from the thread \" + Thread.currentThread().getName() +\r\n        \", only the event queue: http://www.netbeans.org/download/4_1/javadoc/OpenAPIs/apichanges.html#actions-event-thread\";\r\n\r\n        if (r.async && !r.needsToBeSynchronous()) {\r\n            Runnable r2 = new Runnable() {\r\n                    public void run() {\r\n                        r.doRun();\r\n                    }\r\n                };\r\n\r\n            RP.post(r2);\r\n        } else {\r\n            r.run();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe stack trace shows, that the first branch is taken, so this is a threading violation and modifying the assert just plasters over that fact. Netbeans has several places, that have similar problems and an easy way to find them is to run with substance LAF.\r\n\r\nIMHO: The assert needs to stay as it was. For the end user builds this is a non-problem, as the production builds have assertions disabled. The real fix would be to move Swing interaction into the EDT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/435538455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/435574092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1004#issuecomment-435574092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1004","id":435574092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTU3NDA5Mg==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-03T09:34:42Z","updated_at":"2018-11-03T09:34:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is not a fix, but a work-around.

The exact reproducible code is below: Find usages for constructor A() fails with npe without this change: \r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    void m() {\r\n        Runnable r = new Runnable() {\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                B b = new B() {\r\n                    void test() {\r\n                        System.out.println(\"testB\");\r\n                    }\r\n                };\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n    class A {\r\n        public A() {\r\n        }\r\n        void test() {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    class B extends A {\r\n    }\r\n}","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/437053250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/437340825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1017#issuecomment-437340825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1017","id":437340825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzM0MDgyNQ==","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-09T12:06:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-09T12:06:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I maybe do not understand the problem, sorry.

There are a few aspects in my mind here:\r\n\r\n* generally speaking icons won't move around displays with different scalings. So, it seems better to always cache and risk a bad icon when move than to never cache and pay some computational cost for every repaint. Not caching is correct, but is it really worth the price? (Then again, we have no measurement of the actual cost).\r\n\r\n* the old (existing?) NetBeans code cared a lot about image caching, so I assume they had some metrics for this fear.\r\n\r\n* there is something odd about the design too. So `DisabledIcon` wraps an `Icon`. But then during paint time: it creates a temporary image, paints the icon there, creates a disables *image* then paints that. Considering icons are the closest we have to vector graphics (ie. non-raster) in AWT/Swing, this roundtrip is annoying to me. I guess I'm surprised we can't do `RGBImageFilter` at Graphics2D level, like we can do a `setTransform`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/437701299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/437717243","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/998#issuecomment-437717243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/998","id":437717243,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzcxNzI0Mw==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-11T23:49:58Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T23:49:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added another commit that implements caching.

These modules are wrappers around [OpenJFX](http://openjfx.io) maven JARs, however none of the modules contains the GPL licensed JARs by itself - it just references them and the plugin manager downloads them directly to the user when installing them.\r\n\r\nAs such it is important for the modules to not be present in the final ZIP and only available from an update center. Putting the modules into `extra` cluster manages the first part - they aren't in the ZIP. To make them available from an update center this change introduces a \"local\" update center that holds the (empty) NBM files. Ready for install at any time.\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested on JDK8 and JDK11. On JDK8 only `nb-javac` is downloaded. On JDK11 one can continue without downloading anything, or download both: the `nb-javac` as well as appropriate `openjfx` library.\r\n\r\nPlease review, approve, integrate.

I think it should be similar. SVG would be great but someone said, that this is not possible with normal Swing AFAIK.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what I thought is to change everything where it makes sense (maybe 80-90%) to PNG instead of using GIF. And AFAIK yes the splashscreen is GIF instead of PNG, this is why the quality is a bit poor. But I'm not 100% sure, @geertjanw asked for the GIF for the SplashScreen and for a PNG for the about dialog or vice versa. can't remember it exactly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/440218750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/440218816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/942#issuecomment-440218816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/942","id":440218816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDIxODgxNg==","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T10:14:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T10:14:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And yes should be discussed on the mailing list :).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/440218816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
