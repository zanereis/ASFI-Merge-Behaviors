For example, the supervisor may keep all mapping information between a base dataSource and its derived dataSources in somewhere like memory, disk or metastore. Since the number of segments of a dataSource is usually several hundreds, this might not be a big overhead while the number of derived dataSources is kept small.\r\n\r\nI thought about this mapping before. For each derived datasource, this mapping can be interval -> a list of  base segmentIds and stored in database when supervisor commit datasource metadata. However, in my experience, some dataSources have 200-400 segments and about 100-200G each day. Druid don't work well on these kinds of dataSource. We add more than 10 derived dataSources for each big dataSource to make query faster. If we keep such a big mapping for each derived dataSource,  I'm afraid that the overhead is too large. Typically, this kind of big dataSource is the best user of materialized view. However, after seeing your suggestions, I do not know which method is better now.\r\n\r\n> Actually, the current implementation of TaskLockbox allows to use a specified segment version. \r\n\r\nI mean TaskLockbox doesn't have a method to set preferredVersion, instead, tasks can choose to use a specified version but not the version TaskLockbox returns. Anyway, this feature is only used when I want to control the segment version of derived dataSources in derived dataSource supervisor. Maybe it's a pseudo demand.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377113777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377114154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5545#issuecomment-377114154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5545","id":377114154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzExNDE1NA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T04:00:01Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T04:00:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have no opinion, but was just curious which types of PRs are refactoring. \r\nI'm merging this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377114154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377176925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5550#issuecomment-377176925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5550","id":377176925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzE3NjkyNQ==","user":{"login":"josephglanville","id":605591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTU5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville","html_url":"https://github.com/josephglanville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephglanville/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T09:23:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T09:23:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Depending on how you are ingesting your data you can have Druid create sharded segments.

It found tasks by looking for the chat handler announcement. And the `// rofl` line was a hack to make sure the firehose is announced in the format that Tranquility is looking for. I'm not sure if it's still needed, but that would be the place to look to figure that out.\r\n\r\nFwiw, Tranquility these days supports a non-ZK based method of discovering tasks (it can use the overlord APIs).

So I think it'd be ok to remove them once Tranquility's default is changed, and a new Tranquility release is done, and release notes are updated accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377977885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377995113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5561#issuecomment-377995113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5561","id":377995113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Nzk5NTExMw==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-02T18:00:38Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T18:00:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is fixed by: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/5554","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377995113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/377997640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5149#issuecomment-377997640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5149","id":377997640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Nzk5NzY0MA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-02T18:10:12Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T18:10:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the report!

IMO, the best way to handle autodetected columns is not to ask the user to specify a default value per type, but instead to have a catch-all config like \"replace missing values with defaults rather than nulls\". It would be like the null handling config in the current patchsets, but only affects indexing time.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is that in the long run, _by default_, Druid should replace missing values with defaults at indexing time rather than storing them as nulls.

Instead, it introduces new task types (and required shuffle system) for parallel indexing. Since these new task types should allow any types of splittable firehoses, they can be used for reindexing if we add a splittable `IngestSegmentFirehose`.

At that point, what can it do other than something generic like split the file on newlines? Which is what most of the file-oriented FirehoseFactories do. And that means they won't work with Parquet files.\r\n\r\nThis design made sense for loading data from a message oriented system like Kafka, which is what FirehoseFactories were originally designed to do. It is the responsibility of the message system to deliver one row at a time. But it doesn't really make sense for reading from files, where there is the added complexity of a container format that something needs to be aware of.\r\n\r\nI think the right design for this would be that the file-based FirehoseFactories have some additional parameter, \"reader\" or what have you, that knows how to split streams into rows that are acceptable to the parser. The default should be a LineOrientedReader that splits the stream on newlines into strings, but there could be another one that knows how to read Parquet files. The message-based FirehoseFactories (like Kafka) wouldn't have this parameter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/379296624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/379355318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5588#issuecomment-379355318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5588","id":379355318,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTM1NTMxOA==","user":{"login":"mkuthan","id":1560526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjA1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1560526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan","html_url":"https://github.com/mkuthan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkuthan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-06T19:34:57Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T19:34:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It worked on version 0.10 with some headers modification on load balancer in front of druid brokers.
