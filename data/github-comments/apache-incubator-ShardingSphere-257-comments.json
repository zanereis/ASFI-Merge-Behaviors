there is a long disscusion with this issue and two related PR #13187 and #13362 . I'd like to say\r\n\r\n- It is a lack of documents to understand the sharding sphere transaction desgin, does anybody point out if I miss it ?\r\n- There is a confusion between ```TransactionType.XA``` and using XA scenario with ```sharding-proxy```.\r\n- It seem that we change the semantics of some transaction statments, such as ```set autoCommit```.\r\n\r\nAnd  I think it is very important of the transactional functions of sharding sphere especially in production system which is concerned about the data consistency.\r\n\r\nIt should have a good chance to talk about this issue in the meetup but unfortunately we missed it due to COVID-19. Anyway, I think it could be helpful to have this disscusion face to face and it might be much clearer understand. Although this issue could be a very hard and tough, I believe that we can resolve it finally because **WE ARE GREAT TEAM**.\r\n\r\nFeel free to schedul a online meeting for disscussion if you think this is necessary. @roodkcab @RaigorJiang @TeslaCN @tristaZero @jingshanglu

Well, there is a long disscusion with this issue and two related PR #13187 and #13362 . I'd like to say\r\n> \r\n> * It is a lack of documents to understand the sharding sphere transaction desgin, does anybody point out if I miss it ?\r\n> * There is a confusion between `TransactionType.XA` and using XA scenario with `sharding-proxy`.\r\n> * It seem that we change the semantics of some transaction statments, such as `set autoCommit`.\r\n> \r\n> And I think it is very important of the transactional functions of sharding sphere especially in production system which is concerned about the data consistency.\r\n> \r\n> It should have a good chance to talk about this issue in the meetup but unfortunately we missed it due to COVID-19. Anyway, I think it could be helpful to have this disscusion face to face and it might be much clearer understand. Although this issue could be a very hard and tough, I believe that we can resolve it finally because **WE ARE GREAT TEAM**.\r\n> \r\n> Feel free to schedul a online meeting for disscussion if you think this is necessary. @roodkcab @RaigorJiang @TeslaCN @tristaZero @jingshanglu\r\n\r\ngood idea，we can also disscussion on https://community.sphere-ex.com/t/topic/367, We can temporarily specify a
