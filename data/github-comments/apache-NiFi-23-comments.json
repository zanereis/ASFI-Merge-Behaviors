Well, I am not sure what that is (will be looking) and how reliable mailtrap.io is for such testing giving it's description \"Fake smtp testing server. Dummy smtp email testing\". I've tested it with few real servers (gmail, yahoo etc) and all is good. I am not dismissing that there may be a problem but let's make sure we are not chasing some dummy error in mailtrap.io.

Working on some changes based on your feedback.\n\nRegarding the need for RangerBasePluginWithPolicies... unfortunately the PolicyEngine is a private member variable of RangerBasePlugin and there is no getter for it, so no way to access it. I think most other plugins would never need to, but for NiFi we need to know if the reason for denying access was because no policy exists for the resource, or because a specific policy exists that doesn't match the incoming request. \n\nSo the best I could come up with was to intercept when the policies are refreshed and store the resource ids so that when RangerAccessResult getIsAllowed() returns false we can then do a second check to see if there was even a policy for the given resource, and if not then return resource not found, rather than denied.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/234967054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/234992062","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/675#issuecomment-234992062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/675","id":234992062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDk5MjA2Mg==","user":{"login":"PuspenduBanerjee","id":5090152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTAxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5090152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee","html_url":"https://github.com/PuspenduBanerjee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-25T15:41:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T15:41:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @apiri .
