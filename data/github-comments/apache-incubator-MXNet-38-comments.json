Consider this example. ALLOCING is traced every time when `cudaMalloc` is called. `cudaFree` also traces when it is called, so it appears to be never called in this example:\n\n```\n>>> ctx = mx.gpu(0)\n>>> def test():\n...     mx.nd.zeros((100, 100), ctx)\n...\n>>> test()\n[11:35:53] src/storage/./gpu_device_storage.h:40: ALLOCING 40000 0x700c09e00\n>>> test()\n>>> test()\n```\n\nNotice how after first  call to `test` the array is allocated, but not freed, even though it goes out of scope as soon as the function ends. However, when I call the function again, it doesn't allocate anything, so it reused the previously allocated memory. If I replace `zeros` with `mx.nd.array`, the behavior is the same.\n\nAm I right that the chunks of memory are cached in some way? Can I disable this behavior? In my case I call the same function on different shapes, and therefore the cached memory is not reused and wasted, resulting in `Out of Memory` error\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/168422418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/168424798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1134#issuecomment-168424798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1134","id":168424798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODQyNDc5OA==","user":{"login":"antinucleon","id":1258974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1258974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon","html_url":"https://github.com/antinucleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-02T20:06:21Z","updated_at":"2016-01-02T20:06:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong I tested misc.pickle has some problem when pickle optimizer.

The problem is in storage.cc. It uses `PooledStorageManager`, which, in fact, does do caching. It has some logic to prevent OOM, but there are two issues with it:\n1. The threshold is hardcoded to 4GB. It is hardcoded to an extent that it is a template argument, not even a variable :) My videocard has 2GB of memory, so obviously it OOMs way before the threshold is reached.\n2. The threshold check is broken anyway. Look at this code from `pooled_storage_manager.h`:\n\n```\n    if (kThreshold <= used_memory_) {\n      ReleaseAll();\n    }\n    used_memory_ += size;\n    return DeviceStorage::Alloc(size);\n```\n\nIt compares used memory with the threshold before it increases the memory used, so if an allocation exceeds 4GB, it will go through, and cause OOM even if I do have 4GB. The logic should be:\n\n```\n    used_memory_ += size;\n    if (kThreshold <= used_memory_) {\n      ReleaseAll();\n    }\n    return DeviceStorage::Alloc(size);\n```\n\nFor a fix I suggest to make the threshold a variable instead of a template argument, and set it to the total GPU memory. I would also suggest to add an environment variable that allows changing it.\n\nFor my purposes for now I just reduced the threshold to 1.5GB in the source code.\n\nAlso, I don't know if you care about windows, but on windows this line will overflow:\n\n```\n 4096 * 1024 * 1024ul\n```\n\nBecause unsigned long is 32 bit. Should be `ull` instead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/168426014/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/168427669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1135#issuecomment-168427669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1135","id":168427669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODQyNzY2OQ==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-02T20:57:43Z","updated_at":"2016-01-02T20:57:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"have you installed the nvidia driver? libcuda.so is often located at\n\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so\n/usr/lib64/libcuda.so\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/168427669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/168427675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1130#issuecomment-168427675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1130","id":168427675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODQyNzY3NQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-02T20:57:51Z","updated_at":"2016-01-02T20:57:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it should be `kThreshold <= used_memory_ + size`.
