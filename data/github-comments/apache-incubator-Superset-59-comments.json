more update on possible \"Advanced tutorial\". \r\nI found that the only explanation on \"Series\", \"Entity\", \"Metric\" etc was the live hint of \"mouse-over\". That would be cool if it could be explained somewhere connecting to the examples shipped. \r\nAnd it's also beneficial to add indicator of what's necessary and what's not. \r\nI was playing around with \"Bubble\" chart type with my own data. And I don't have Series/Entity recognized so it reports \"Pick a metric for x,y and size\" error which is very hard to understand since there is no \"Metric\" field at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/284983437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/284988956","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2361#issuecomment-284988956","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2361","id":284988956,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDk4ODk1Ng==","user":{"login":"cristobalcl","id":538203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl","html_url":"https://github.com/cristobalcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobalcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-08T09:18:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T09:18:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, I'll try to install from the `master`.
