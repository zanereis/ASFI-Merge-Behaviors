all, sorry for such a tardy follow-up on this but I've updated the design of this feature as we've discussed. The concerns I kept in mind are:\r\n~ The weight of the action should be reflected in the prominence of the indicator / toggle\r\n~ Changing the status shouldn't be buried in a drop-down\r\n~ It should be clear what a dashboard having a particular status means to new users\r\n\r\nThe main ways I've alleviated these issues are:\r\n~ The indicator / toggle is next to the title making it nigh impossible to miss\r\n~ There is no option for publishing in the dropdown, one must use the status toggle (which also always surfaces the tooltip)\r\n~ Tooltips are provided which explain what these terms mean and how to interact with it. (For instance prompting clicking the button to toggle it or encouraging users to favorite it if they wish to see it in their list of dashboards)\r\n\r\nthe mechanics still work the same (admin can see all dashboards, users can see dashboards they've favorited, etc). The description provided by @sylvia-tomiyama a few comments back hits the nail on the head.\r\n\r\nThe new design moves the toggle between the title of the dashboard and the favorite star – this way the user can do all they need to with the dashboard in regards to publishing in one place:\r\n\r\n1. See the status clearly displayed\r\n2. Toggle the status (if permitted)\r\n3. Favorite the dashboard if they wish to (due to it being a draft and wanting to access it later) \r\n\r\n## **For a draft (unpublished) dashboard**\r\n\r\n### _As the owner_\r\n\r\nThis badge is no longer just a badge but actually a `<button>` tag so that the user can toggle the status. It then says \"Published\" as you can see in a couple images.\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tresdon/misc_public/master/images/superset/draft_as_admin.png)\r\n\r\n### _As another_\r\n\r\nThis badge is not clickable since the user does not have edit rights on the dashboard. It is just a `<div>` tag\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tresdon/misc_public/master/images/superset/draft_as_gamma.png)\r\n\r\n## **For a published dashboard**\r\n\r\n### _As the owner_\r\n\r\nThis is a  <button> which will toggle back to being a draft if clicked. Same as above. I didn't get it in the image but it has the tooltip:\r\n> This dashboard is published. Click to make it a draft.\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tresdon/misc_public/master/images/superset/published_as_admin.png)\r\n\r\n### _As another_\r\n\r\nNothing shows up for this user since it's a published dashboard.\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tresdon/misc_public/master/images/superset/published_as_gamma.png)\r\n\r\n## To summarize:\r\nThose with permissions to edit the dashboard will always see a `<button>` which specifies the current state of the dashboard and allows them to toggle it.\r\n\r\nThose who are just visiting the dashboard will see a non-clickable (`<div>`) \"Draft\" badge if it is a draft else they will see nothing.\r\n\r\nI think this addresses the main concerns we were discussing but would love to get some feedback from @elibrumbaugh and any other folks who may be relevant so that we might be able to move forward on this.\r\n\r\nHope everyone's holiday season is great!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/449490443/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/449512172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2914#issuecomment-449512172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2914","id":449512172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTUxMjE3Mg==","user":{"login":"Ritesh205","id":23625905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjI1OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23625905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205","html_url":"https://github.com/Ritesh205","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ritesh205/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T22:17:50Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T22:17:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Could
