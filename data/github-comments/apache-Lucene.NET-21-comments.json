This happens on all operating systems and .NET versions. I got it to fail on .NET 7 after that post.\r\n\r\nWe cannot rule out that the problem lies in the test or the test framework, but it almost certainly is in our codebase. We have a configuration that never existed in Lucene. We are somewhere between 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 on the documents writer stuff. We should go through the JIRA issues in the [Changes.txt](https://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.1/lucene/CHANGES.txt#L6-L62) to determine if we have all of the changes that are relevant to the documents writer.

I suggest closing the IDE and then doing the following:\r\n\r\n- Delete all of your /bin and /obj folders (be careful not to delete the objects folder below /.git)\r\n- Clear the IKVM cache in the `~\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ikvm\\cache` folder\r\n- Clear the `~\\.m2` cache\r\n\r\nIf upon reopening you still have issues compiling, report the issue to [ikvm-maven](https://github.com/ikvmnet/ikvm-maven). The team is pretty responsive.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOn Azure DevOps, I was able to reproduce the test failure, but this time it took 60 runs and it only happened once: https://dev.azure.com/lucene-net-temp4/Main/_build/results?buildId=266&view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab&runId=191370&resultId=100202&paneView=debug\r\n\r\nI was also able to get it to fail locally with the seed from [#886](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/886#issuecomment-1822964001).

The following info is helpful:\r\n\r\n1. [Everything You Always Wanted To Know About fsync()](https://blog.httrack.com/blog/2013/11/15/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-fsync/)\r\n2. [Testing Lucene's index durability after crash or power loss](https://blog.mikemccandless.com/2014/04/testing-lucenes-index-durability-after.html)\r\n\r\nHere is the fsync approach in Lucene 4.8.0:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/8fdf89690404c0e65784b2c5477552b9dec58591/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/IOUtils.java#L372-L418\r\n\r\nIt supports either a file name or a directory name (a string) and is called like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/store/FSDirectory.java#L299-L316\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but it seems that .NET only supports fsync on individual files, but not on all of the files in a directory.\r\n\r\nSo, if that assumption is true, the only way to do fsync is to use native code. And indeed that is what is done in [ravendb](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aravendb%2Fravendb%20fsync&type=code).\r\n\r\nIt also looks like the fsync call needs to be synchronized with any writes or flushes to the file buffer, but maybe Lucene already does external synchronization.\r\n\r\nDo note that our file locking approach depends on `FileStream`, so if for some reason we cannot use `FileStream`, we will also need to redesign our file locking approach.\r\n\r\n## Directory Level Fsync\r\n\r\nRavendb has a method that accepts a directory path and will do the [fsync on the whole directory](https://github.com/ravendb/ravendb/blob/99fe8133164d9d09f0f7f66891d890ab3c0d5b9e/src/Sparrow.Server/Platform/Posix/Syscall.cs#L321-L443), so this appears to be a suitable replacement for the `FileChannel.force()` call in Java when the `FileChannel` is based on a directory.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that ravendb isn't covered under one of the licenses that are [acceptable by Apache](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#criteria). They were GNU back on version 3.5 and prior, but it doesn't look like any of those versions have this set up yet on non-Windows OSes.\r\n\r\n## File Level Fsync\r\n\r\nIn Lucene, \"stale files\" were tracked in a synchronized `HashSet<string>`. These are fsynced first before doing the fsync at the directory level.\r\n\r\nI looked at the source of `FileStream` and indeed when you call `Flush(false)` it will simply flush into the OS cache but not do the FSync. It also does not FSync if you call `Dispose()`. Technically, we could open a new `FileStream` instance on a file string for writing and then call `Flush(true)` to do the file-level FSync call, but there would be some overhead to instantiate the `FileStream` instance. And although there is an option that can be passed that is supposed to indicate not to create a buffer, it doesn't appear to be implemented, so there would need to be at least a 1 byte array allocated as well.\r\n\r\nSo, it appears that a better option might be to use the same low level native calls that Ravendb uses at the file level as well.\r\n\r\n## Synchronization\r\n\r\nThis is the tricky bit. In Java, the `FileChannel` instance does blocking to ensure that no write/flush/fsync operations can happen simultaneously according to the [docs in Apache Harmony](https://github.com/apache/harmony/blob/02970cb7227a335edd2c8457ebdde0195a735733/classlib/modules/nio/src/main/java/common/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.java#L64-L68). I haven't dug much into the implementation as to how to allow individual files to be written during normal application use but then be able to gain an exclusive lock on the entire directory to do the directory-level fsync.\r\n\r\nIt also appears that the need to block makes it impossible (or at least extremely difficult) to use `FileOptions.Asynchronous`. It is kind of pointless anyway if you don't explicitly call the `FlushAsync()` and `WriteAsync()` methods, and it takes you down a completely different implementation. Also, when it is enabled on Linux, the FSync happens automatically on `FlushAsync()` and on `Dispose()`.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt would be great to get some feedback on this to see if anyone has any ideas that we could integrate. And of course setting up the project for deploying the native bits via NuGet on the various operating systems that .NET Core supports is not something I have looked into. If someone with experience doing this could provide some guidance, that would be great.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2080427474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2080980530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/846#issuecomment-2080980530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/846","id":2080980530,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c58CT4y","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-27T16:06:07Z","updated_at":"2024-04-27T16:06:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888

Much of it has been forked in various repos and attempted to be updated to work. Most people don't fully understand what is actually does though:\r\n\r\nWhat is doesn't do:\r\n\r\n* It does not allow you to share indexes between processes\r\n\r\nWhat it does do:\r\n\r\n* It 'syncs' the lucene files from a central storage (i.e. Blob Storage) to local storage of the current process (i.e. %temp%) folder\r\n* It attempts to keep both the local storage and central storage in sync\r\n* When an Azure App Service using this library is moved to another worker, it will re-sync the main storage to local storage in an attempt to keep working as it was on the previous worker\r\n\r\nThe lib isn't maintained because this underlying process has several issues because depending on the index activity, writing this much to blob storage and local storage and keeping it in sync is difficult and can easily cause index corruption issues.\r\n\r\nI have a similar implementation in the Examine library that is actively used by tons of Umbraco websites which is stable: https://github.com/Shazwazza/Examine/blob/release/3.0/src/Examine.Lucene/Directories/SyncedFileSystemDirectoryFactory.cs\r\n\r\nThis doesn't use Blob storage, but just the main file system in Azure

system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2090604251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2099350005","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/935#issuecomment-2099350005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/935","id":2099350005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c59IYn1","user":{"login":"pc-LMS","id":168029554,"node_id":"U_kgDOCgPtcg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168029554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS","html_url":"https://github.com/pc-LMS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-07T21:35:43Z","updated_at":"2024-05-07T21:36:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jeme

I tried with `net8.0` (which has been changed as the default IDE test platform since the last time I checked) with the same configuration you used and it doesn't fail there. But then I changed the test target to `net6.0` and it failed on the first run. So, that probably explains why you are not reproducing it.\r\n\r\nI think I worked out what is happening, though. \r\n\r\n### Issue 1\r\n\r\nThe error indicates that `dwpt` is `null` on this line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/878261fa920a961288639863da28d7c9f5d0d800/src/Lucene.Net/Index/DocumentsWriterFlushControl.cs#L471\r\n\r\nDigging into the `DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool`, there is only 1 way it could return `null`, and that is if this method is called: https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/878261fa920a961288639863da28d7c9f5d0d800/src/Lucene.Net/Index/DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool.cs#L91\r\n\r\nWe cannot pass [this line](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/878261fa920a961288639863da28d7c9f5d0d800/src/Lucene.Net/Index/DocumentsWriterFlushControl.cs#L465) unless `perThread.IsInitialized` returns `true`. And that can only happen if `dwpt` is not `null`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to fail in this way, `DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool.Reset(perThread, closed)` must be called on a different thread while [these lines](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/878261fa920a961288639863da28d7c9f5d0d800/src/Lucene.Net/Index/DocumentsWriterFlushControl.cs#L467-L470) are executing. This explains why it is an exceedingly rare event.\r\n\r\nI checked and there are 4 calls to `DocumentsWriterPerThreadPool.Reset(perThread, closed)`. All of them are called within `UninterruptableMonitor.Enter(this)` except for this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/878261fa920a961288639863da28d7c9f5d0d800/src/Lucene.Net/Index/DocumentsWriterFlushControl.cs#L818\r\n\r\nSo, moving the `UninterruptableMonitor.Enter(this)` outside of that call should fix the problem.\r\n\r\n### Issue 2\r\n\r\nAfter that fix, we still got some failures. But it was also clear from the stack trace what was happening. If `TryLock()` returns `false`, we end up on this line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/fix/GH-935-documentswriter-concurrency/src/Lucene.Net/Index/DocumentsWriterFlushControl.cs#L484\r\n\r\nThe [documentation for ReentrantLock.tryLock()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F8%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html#tryLock--) states:\r\n\r\n> Even when this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy, a call to tryLock() will immediately acquire the lock if it is available, whether or not other threads are currently waiting for the lock. This \"barging\" behavior can be useful in certain circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor the fairness setting for this lock, then use [tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F8%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html#tryLock-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-)which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).\r\n>\r\n> If the current thread already holds this lock then the hold count is incremented by one and the method returns true.\r\n>\r\n> If the lock is held by another thread then this method will return immediately with the value false.\r\n\r\nSo, it can return false, but I don't think it ever does in practice since a `null` return value from `InternalTryCheckOutForFlush()` will cause an error (assert in test, NullReferenceException in production). So, apparently Lucene relies on the \"barging\" behavior of this method to be put in the front of the queue.\r\n\r\n.NET has no such behavior, but I don't think it really matters which order the locks are taken in as long as `ReentrantLock.TryLock()` returns `true`. So, I changed it to call `UninterruptableMonitor.Enter(object, ref bool)` instead of `UninterruptableMonitor.TryEnter(object)`, which will always acquire the lock and return `true`.\r\n\r\nThis probably won't perform as well because the method is supposed to return immediately and may end up deadlocking, but so far it seems to perform better and never deadlock.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nI am running the tests now to see if the above changes work on all platforms, but locally this seems promising.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2118228819/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2127030754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/935#issuecomment-2127030754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/935","id":2127030754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c5-x-ni","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-23T12:51:31Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T12:51:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have just submitted #940 with a patch.

So, that probably explains why you are not reproducing it.\r\n\r\nNot really as I actually tested on the various .net versions, other things came up as we had a break down in one of our systems due to a windows update, so I have sadly been busy elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut I am actually having another timing related bug in another codebase which I can easily reproduce at work with a single run of a test (always fails after ~max 2min, a run is 10min), but it's far harder to reproduce the same bug at home on the same PC as I am having trouble reproducing this issue (takes 2-3 runs). So I don't know.\r\n\r\nRunning the Lucene tests at work has proven to be a challenge though, I don't know if it's because I use ReSharper that the Lucene solution seems to be very slugish for me to work with, or it's something else. But I always have challenges getting started working on anything.\r\n\r\nBut great if you found a fix.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2128687232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2135704169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/940#issuecomment-2135704169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/940","id":2135704169,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c5_TEJp","user":{"login":"pc-LMS","id":168029554,"node_id":"U_kgDOCgPtcg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168029554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS","html_url":"https://github.com/pc-LMS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pc-LMS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-28T16:47:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T16:47:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jeme @rclabo Hello, I am reaching out to see if you have some time to review the request.

That helps a lot.  Maybe we can work together to make sense out of what you are seeing.\r\n\r\nOne challenge in creating any kind of benchmark is having enough data to index so that it takes some time for LuceneNET to complete. LuceneNET is very fast, so thousands of records of data are needed.  I went on a hunt for an open-source data set that we could use. Ultimately I chose the [Book Dataset from Kaggle.com]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset/data), which is available under a CC0 public domain license.\r\n\r\nThe dataset has approx. 271K records and each record contains several fields (Book Title, Author, URL to cover photo, etc.).  To allow the program to load data in parallel, I created 21 copies of this data which is 5.4 million records total.  Because sometimes it’s nice to be able to run the program more quickly when tweaking settings to see if they matter much, I also create 21 “small” data files, which contain about 50,000 records each for a total of 1.05 million records total.\r\n\r\nA single flag at the top of the program causes it to index big or small files. Either way, it’s indexing 21 files.\r\nI wrote a `DataReader` class that can read one record at a time from one of these data files. It uses a `Stream`, which in .NET is a performant approach. The implementation uses synchronous IO, but I tried a version of the app with async IO (async await) for reading these data files, and it made no difference from a performance perspective. \r\n\r\nUsing this console app I tested the performance of Lucene.NET Beta 16, vs, the current master vs, [PR#940](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/940) and I get more or less the same results from each.\r\n\r\nI tried different levels of parallelism to see how that affected performance and also tried different levels of `RAMBufferSizeMB`.  In the process, I came to realize that by default Lucen.NET 4.8 will use a MAX of 8 threads for creating index segments via DWTP threads when using the IndexWriter. At first, I thought perhaps this was the issue and a larger value just needed to be passed via the ` IndexWriterConfig.MaxThreadStates` when the IndexWriter is created.  But that didn’t turn out to be true.  In fact, on my hardware I ultimately got faster performance by passing a SMALLER value then the default for the `indexWriterConfig.MaxThreadStates` value.  \r\n\r\nI’m providing this full working .NET console app that uses .NET 8 including the data used and solution file and structure.  So you can easily run this on your hardware and try different values for the number of threads used to read the data files, the `MaxThreadStates`, and the `RAMBufferSizeMB` value. What I’m most interested in, is having you port this code to java and run it using the exact same dataset in a java environment.  The solution with all the data was 412MB which GitHub wouldn't let me upload (it has a 25MB limit) so I trimmed the solution down to one small data file and one big one and then when the app runs it will create the other 20 small data files and 20 big ones on the fly.  This got the app just barely under the upload limit. :-)\r\n\r\nIdeally run the console using the big data set, which is how I have the app configured by default.  The app auto-deletes the LuceneIndex folder before each run.  So you can run it multiple times in a row and you will be left with just the LuceneIndex from the last run in the LuceneIndex folder.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear back your Lucene.NET 4.8 results vs Java results and have you contribute back your java code port of this console app.  I'd also like to understand exactly which version of Java Lucene you are benchmarking against.\r\n\r\nOn my machine, Lucene.NET can index the 5.65 million book records in 47 seconds, which is a rate of approximately 119K records per second.  That average time includes the final commit time.  \r\n\r\nTo my eyes that seems pretty darn fast.  But if the Java version can really index these same documents much faster that would be great to know.\r\n\r\n[LuceneIndexingPerformane.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15877758/LuceneIndexingPerformane.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2174514794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2176451792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/940#issuecomment-2176451792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/940","id":2176451792,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6BugTQ","user":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-18T15:57:37Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T15:57:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pc-LMS\r\n>We also ran a test and did not see any performance improvements - CPU remained at the same level and was not elevated in anyway. \r\n\r\nToday I made a private branch off of of this PR and I hacked in some concurrent logging to memory deep inside the indexing code at the dwpt level.  Specifically I logged to memory each time a thread entered the `documentWriterPerThread.UpdateDocument(...)` method and each time a thread left that method.  Through this code I was able to unequivocally verify that with this PR multiple threads are able to call `documentWriterPerThread.UpdateDocument(...)`  in parallel.  \r\n\r\nIn my observations during performance testing, I could never get my processor above 45% utilization, and then only for brief spikes, but that kinda makes sense to me given the fact that indexing is pretty clearly an IO bound operation not a CPU bound operation.\r\n\r\nJust for fun I created a parallel threading test where I had up to 20 threads reading text files in one format and writing them in another format via an input and output stream per thread.  My local processor has 20 cores.  This 2nd setup doesn't use Lucene.NET in any way but I wanted to see if outside of Lucene.NET I could get high utilization of my CPU  when using lots of threads doing heavy IO work.  And the answer, as I suspected, is no.  My processor never got even above 35% utilization and that just for brief spikes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2176451792/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2247101054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/938#issuecomment-2247101054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/938","id":2247101054,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6F8Ap-","user":{"login":"turowicz","id":1055391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1055391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz","html_url":"https://github.com/turowicz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turowicz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-24T07:28:31Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T07:29:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@paulirwin @NightOwl888  Is this moving forward?

I didn't see your comment back in April.\r\n\r\nThanks for offering to help with compatibility. One way you might be able to help us is to add support (even if it is unofficial) to the latest version of Lucene to read 4.8.0 codecs. The [backwards-codecs package](https://github.com/apache/lucene/tree/releases/lucene-solr/8.8.1/lucene/backward-codecs/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs) only goes back to Lucene 5.x.\r\n\r\nOur plan is that once Lucene.NET 4.8.0 is stable to jump ahead to the current version, so it would be beneficial if Lucene.NET users could upgrade the software first and upgrade their index at some later point. It would save us some time if we didn't have to grab the 4.x codecs from the last version that supported them and try to splice them into the backwards-codecs package, as offhand I don't really know what is involved.\r\n\r\nAnother way you could help us (since you linked to the issue) is to provide some guidance on the [analysis-nori](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/645) module ([latest work here](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/tree/feature/analysis-nori-2)). We got most of it working, but there are 3 test failures that were difficult to find an answer for. The tests are [`TestRandomHugeStringsMockGraphAfter`](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/feature/analysis-nori-2/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Analysis.Nori/TestKoreanTokenizer.cs#L447), [TestUserDict](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/feature/analysis-nori-2/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Analysis.Nori/TestKoreanTokenizerFactory.cs#L95), and [TestLookup](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/feature/analysis-nori-2/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Analysis.Nori/Dict/UserDictionaryTest.cs#L29). The biggest issue is that it is ported from Lucene 8.2.0 and the FST implementation has completely changed. I tried recreating the UserDictionary with our ported code, but the UserDict test still doesn't pass. I also tried porting over the earliest version, but FST had changed before then.\r\n\r\nNow, since the kuromoji module is almost identical and it runs on 4.8.0, I suspect there is a solution. I have already [asked the Lucene team](https://lists.apache.org/thread/b5nt4hwbkxo5s75z32kp1ocg87q2qoq8), but their advice was just to wait until we upgrade. However, if we have someone who is willing to help us find a solution, maybe we can make this available sooner.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2291774218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2293018525","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/645#issuecomment-2293018525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/645","id":2293018525,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6IrK-d","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-16T07:56:44Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T07:56:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note that for BigDecimal, there is a decent port of one here: https://github.com/Singulink/Singulink.Numerics.BigDecimal.

The comments in this contribution aim to significantly improve the documentation for these methods. While it's true that many of these static main(args) methods could technically be called by application code, they were designed with command-line usage in mind. I believe these comments provide valuable context for developers who might find such methods unusual in a .NET DLL. By pointing them to the Lucene CLI and even specifying the relevant commands, these comments help to clarify an otherwise puzzling aspect of the project.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the PR as it stands makes a positive contribution and moves the project forward. Rather than focusing on further refinement of the comments, I would suggest that the primary question should be whether this contribution, overall, improves the project.

The performance gain is only on .NET 9 or greater, but there is no performance loss for .NET 8 or earlier.\r\n\r\nMore and more people will start adopting .NET 9, and later .NET 10, at which point the assumption is that .NET 8 would still be targeted by Lucene.NET. Therefore it stands to reason that one should ask whether or not it should be done. If the answer is yes, delaying it provides no value, except sensible ones such as waiting for .NET 9.0 to be officially released.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2385801710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2398830894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/968#issuecomment-2398830894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/968","id":2398830894,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6O-0Eu","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-08T04:51:31Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T04:51:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Needs one more change, will reopen ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2398830894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/2403809672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/961#issuecomment-2403809672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/961","id":2403809672,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJ06c6PRzmI","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-10T02:31:01Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T02:31:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":":warning: **IMPORTANT:** This PR may contain changes to dependency versions.
