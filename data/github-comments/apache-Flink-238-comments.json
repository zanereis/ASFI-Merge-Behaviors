I think this maybe a bit expensive, now I am a bit like to go back the simplest way to store the `keys` into a `list`, and loop the list to perform `process()`, what do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/375960898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/375963009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5751#issuecomment-375963009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5751","id":375963009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTk2MzAwOQ==","user":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-25T11:23:11Z","updated_at":"2018-03-25T11:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @sihuazhou . \r\nI see what you are saying. \r\nLet me think about it and I will get back to you probably tomorrow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/375963009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/375977772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5761#issuecomment-375977772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5761","id":375977772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTk3Nzc3Mg==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-25T15:13:29Z","updated_at":"2018-03-25T15:13:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This commit only support ElasticSearch 1.x.

It's fine to just flatMap() them out after the deserialization schema, but that does not let me deal with timestamps and watermarks correctly. It's possible the source is reading from 2 partitions that are out of sync with each other, but I can't assign a timestamp and watermark for a single message that contains many records that might span multiple timestamps. So I'm just using a timestamp and watermark extractor on the stream separate from the source, and just hoping that I never have out of sync partitions. If a solution is still desired I'd love to contribute, otherwise it looks like I will end up having to write my own custom kafka source..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/376237266/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/376294933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5731#issuecomment-376294933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5731","id":376294933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjI5NDkzMw==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T20:08:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T20:08:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test failures, and needs rebasing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/376294933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/376367984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5724#issuecomment-376367984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5724","id":376367984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjM2Nzk4NA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-27T01:44:52Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T01:44:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @tillrohrmann ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/376367984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/376400325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5751#issuecomment-376400325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5751","id":376400325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjQwMDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"sihuazhou","id":7480427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7480427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sihuazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-27T05:20:26Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T05:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @kl0u , do you have any idea now?

That's a bummer :-(\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the `flink-s3-fs-presto` does not seem to do that, so we might be able to rely on strong consistency for read-after-write.\r\n\r\nMy original suggestion boiled down to changing the test code as follows, which should work if GET is consistent after PUT:\r\n```java\r\npublic static boolean pathExists(\r\n\t\tFileSystem fs,\r\n\t\tPath path,\r\n\t\tboolean expectedExists,\r\n\t\tlong deadline) throws IOException {\r\n\r\n\ttry (FsDataOutputStream ignored = fs.open(path)) {\r\n\t\t// object exists\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t}\r\n\tcatch (FileNotFoundException e) {\r\n\t\t// object does not exist\r\n\t\treturn false;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninstead of the current code.\r\n```java\r\npublic static void checkPathExistsEventually(\r\n\t\tFileSystem fs,\r\n\t\tPath path,\r\n\t\tboolean expectedExists,\r\n\t\tlong deadline) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\r\n\tboolean dirExists;\r\n\twhile ((dirExists = fs.exists(path)) != expectedExists &&\r\n\t\t\tSystem.nanoTime() < deadline) {\r\n\t\tThread.sleep(10);\r\n\t}\r\n\tassertEquals(expectedExists, dirExists);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
