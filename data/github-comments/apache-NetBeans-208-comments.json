While it is visiting the imports, e.g `import java.util.List;` it lands here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/668bca250cd66fd580b6bc3bc34412e80e324f66/java/java.editor/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/editor/imports/ComputeImports.java#L600-L610\r\n\r\nwhere `el` is `java`, so it thinks it has to resolve this. Usually nothing would be found and no window would pop up. However if there is a static method somewhere carrying the name `java`, it will suggest it.\r\n\r\nIf I comment out L609 it would resolve this, however it will likely break in other situations like the case the comment mentions. \r\n\r\nReading the doc of `getPackageElement`, I believe it expects fully qualified non-empty packages, so `java` or `javax` would not be sufficient.\r\n\r\nedit: is this even supposed to visit imports? Since it is adding the root of an import as unresolved element... which is then imported.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Void visitImport(ImportTree node, Map<String, Object> p) {\r\n            return null; // don't visit imports?\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nedit2: this would only mitigate the issue, since any fully qualified class name later in code would still cause the same situation.\r\n\r\ncc @jlahoda

- ISSUE for NB 21... have you seen this with your app? Same issue as before even though I have the same conf file set\r\n\r\nSo, I just updated my NB application to `VERSION210` and it's failing opening toplevel windows and my file project dialog with a failed to opens error even though I know it's there in my `etc/myapp.conf` folder when I run it from the command line from the `target` directory.\r\n\r\nIt also fails when trying to `RUN` the app from the context menu in NetBeans 21 itself.\r\n\r\nI even copied the `netbeans.conf` file from my IDE since it also had the same `opens` statements.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? It's like the settings aren't being read or properly applied.\r\nI'm running jDK17 still and even tried on JDK21 and same thing.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to open my text editors (which worked previously) I

This is\r\ncrucial because Jakarta EE 8 still uses the `javax` namespace, whereas\r\nJakarta EE 9 and above use the `jakarta` namespace. Ensuring the correct\r\nnamespace compatibility was essential for the proper generation of JPA\r\ncontrollers.\r\n\r\n2. **Add JPA Dependencies**:\r\n\r\n   - Explicitly added dependencies for the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) to\r\nthe project. This step was necessary to ensure that all required classes\r\nand methods for JPA were available in the project's classpath.\r\n\r\n3. **Add JAX-RS Dependencies**:\r\n\r\n   - Added dependencies for Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS). While\r\nnot directly related to JPA controllers, this ensures the project includes\r\ncomprehensive support for RESTful services, which might be interdependent\r\nwith other parts of the project.\r\n\r\n4. **Include `maven-war-plugin`**:\r\n\r\n   - Included the `maven-war-plugin` in the project if it wasn't already\r\npresent. This plugin is crucial for packaging the application correctly,\r\nensuring that all dependencies and resources are included during the build\r\nprocess, which can prevent issues related to incomplete builds.\r\n\r\nThese steps ensured that the project configuration was aligned with the\r\nrequirements of Jakarta EE 9.1 and above, resolving the issue of empty JPA\r\ncontrollers by making sure all necessary dependencies and configurations\r\nwere correctly set up.\r\n\r\nI hope this summary help !\r\n\r\nI am also looking forward to trying NB22, thanks for your work :)\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\n\r\nEl El dom, 19 may 2024 a las 15:20, Matthias Bläsing <\r\n***@***.***> escribió:\r\n\r\n> @marcelperezrubin <https://github.com/marcelperezrubin> as already\r\n> stated: This might be fixed in NB22.
