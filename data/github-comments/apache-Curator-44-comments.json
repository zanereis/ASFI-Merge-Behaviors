I'm not sufficiently familiar with Curator to know the implications but happy to test it and report back for my use case when ready.</p>\n\n<p>Strange you couldn't reproduce it. The key is for the curator inject sesison thread to set the state to expired but not proceed further. Then the SendThread tries to post the expired state but returns when it finds the state is already expired, so it just posts the death event causing the event thread to shut down. After that the curator inject sesson thread can carry on. I could capture a video of the repro and post it somewhere?!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for looking into this.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604781871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604781881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1080#issuecomment-2604781881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1080","id":2604781881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3ODE4ODE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T21:05:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:46:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=cammckenzie\">cammckenzie</a>:</i>\n<p>I'm just trying to reproduce this at the moment.

Can't `install-file` from the install plugin be used?\r\n- If I understand the need correctly this only needs to be done on the `curator-client` module right? That's where the shading happens. Or is that you need versions of the other modules that don't refer to the shaded Guava? Will that actually work? That code is all compiled assuming a particular version of Guava. I guess if OSGI-Curator users use the right version of Guava it would work.\r\n- I'm not convinced that `original` is the right prefix for the unshaded JAR. Is there a standard prefix for these things? I'd appreciate it if you'd search around and show some other projects that are doing this and show what prefixes they use. \r\n- We should update the website docs (see `<root>/src/site`) to detail these additional JARs.
