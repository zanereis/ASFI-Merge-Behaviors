[x] JPA: `SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException` is not an instance of `RuntimeException`, so cannot be passed to the built-in ex. translation utilities ... ending up with a too generic` DataAccessException`\r\n- [x] JDO: On unique constraint violation, we get a `NucleusDataStoreException` that translates to `JDODataStoreException` that does not translate to `DataIntegrityViolationException`\r\n- [x] DefaultJdoDialect has no `SQLExceptionTranslator` set, so relies on the JDO provider's native exception translation\r\n- [x] Datanucleus: On unique constraint violation, wraps a `NucleusDataStoreException` with an `IllegalArgumentException` which obscures further translation attempts\r\n- [x] Find the right place where to put the ex. translation logic (that is, translate anything we catch to _Spring's_ `DataAccessException` hierarchy). Could give the `TransactionService` a second change. At least any (Apache Isis) _Interaction_ should make its calls to the persistence layer through the `TransactionService`. This should even hold if within an _Action_ user code is executed that uses _Transactional Spring Proxies_ under the hood that bypass any Apache Isis logic, but we should be able to intercept exceptions at the outer most `TransactionService.callTransactional(callable)` call, even if just participating in an already existing transaction.\r\n- [ ] But then don't let `EntityFacet`(s) do any of the ex. translation stuff, just propagate exceptions as they are.\r\n- [x] Spring's JPA integration, on _unique constraint violation_ throws an Exception only when the Spring managed transaction gets committed, which properly propagates through the `JpaDialect` for translation. However, with Spring's JDO integration, the  Exception is thrown before the Spring managed transaction gets committed, which later does not propagate through the `JdoDialect` for translation. This breaks symmetry and makes it hard to reason on where to put the exception interception logic, that does the translation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/775657475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/comments/779624530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/causeway/pull/378#issuecomment-779624530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/causeway/issues/378","id":779624530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTYyNDUzMA==","user":{"login":"andi-huber","id":17565970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY1OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17565970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber","html_url":"https://github.com/andi-huber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andi-huber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-16T06:45:16Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T06:45:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dependabot ignore this minor version\r\n\r\ndep clashes ...
