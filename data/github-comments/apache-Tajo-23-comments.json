Sorry for a large patch. \n\nHere are some highlights of changes.\n- Added a session variable to set the limitation of broadcast table size for cross join. This value is valid only when `TEST_BROADCAST_JOIN_ENABLED` is set.\n- Cross join is always executed with broadcast join. To do so, at least one input of cross join should be the relation which is smaller than `BROADCAST_CROSS_JOIN_THRESHOLD`.\n- Added `PostLogicalPlanVerifier` to verify that cross join is executable or not.\n- Fixed some bugs in BroadcastJoinRule.\n- Fixed some bugs in QueryTestCaseBase.\n- Removed BNL and NL join executors. Instead, each task executes cross join with hash join. This is because one of inputs of cross join is always cached in the broadcast cache holder.\n- Improved unique key generation for broadcast cache key.\n\nI've tested cross join performance with a cluster consisting of a master and 5 workers. Each worker equips 48 cores, 80 GB memory, and 24 disks. \n\n#### Data\n- partsupp: 80,000,000 rows (12.2 GB in TEXT file)\n- supplier_small: 100,000 rows (14.1 MB in TEXT file)\n\n#### Query\n\n```\nselect count(*) from partsupp, supplier_small\n```\n\n#### Result\n\n1 hrs, 14 mins, 33 sec is taken with this patch. The above query runs forever without this patch because a single worker executes cross join.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/134164003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/134224201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/708#issuecomment-134224201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/708","id":134224201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDIyNDIwMQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-24T14:24:36Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T14:24:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.\n@hyunsik, would you mind reviewing this patch?
