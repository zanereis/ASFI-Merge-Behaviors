Since I don't have access to your jenkins setup, I can only guess, that this setup might be broken in that respect. In fact, the build log shows, that jdk**1.8** is used to run maven but then this is apparently reverted by  using -Pjenkins which activates maven-toolchains-plugin which itself uses **~/.m2/toolchains.xml** to which I don't have access. So my hands are tied here.\r\n\r\n@gaul @nacx  Can one of you guys can provide me with that file so I can investigate further?\r\n@nacx : Maybe you introduced this jenkins profile for exactly that reason (Use jdk7 in order to solve the javadoc errors with JDK8 on jenkins)? If so, you could simply drop the -Pjenkins argument?

Would the issue also manifest when a proper, trusted SSLContext is provided? If so, we should have feature parity there, and allow also to set the custom SSLSocketFactory supplier. One option could be to have the Lazy supplier you created implement both suppliers, and allow users to easily use it to inject both consistently where needed?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/638012548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/638054482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/74#issuecomment-638054482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/74","id":638054482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODA1NDQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"JnRouvignac","id":3717323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTczMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3717323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac","html_url":"https://github.com/JnRouvignac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JnRouvignac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T08:46:01Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T08:46:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for reviewing and merging this change!\r\nThanks to the community for Apache JClouds!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/638054482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/643711607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/75#issuecomment-643711607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/75","id":643711607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzcxMTYwNw==","user":{"login":"gaul","id":848247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul","html_url":"https://github.com/gaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-14T03:12:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-14T03:12:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This will likely fail in CI due to configuration but locally tests fail due a gson issue.

We shouldnt' have a dependency called gson if it is not the official gown, nor we should depend on being connected to that particular unofficial repository.\r\n\r\nThe previous approach was renaming and repackaging, just to make sure it was very clear that we were using a modified gson bundle. If this becomes a problem, then I'd consider just reverting to official gson, and make this an OSGi consumers problem.

In my opinion, if we lack the OSGi expertise to do a proper job there, we should try to stop owning that and delegate that to end-users or to another community that can do it properly.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this deserves a proper discussion in the jclouds dev/users mailing lists so the community is aware of the impact of the change.

Here we should switch to the use of the BND Maven plugin, but it's best to outsource the OSGi rules contained in the pom to bnd files.\r\n\r\nEspecially good is already the use of the Service Provider Interface (SPI) as a plugin framework, which is not OSGi specific and has been supported by Java for a long time. \r\n\r\nThe OSGi package contained in the core module and its classes, especially MetadataBundleListener through the implementation of the interface BundleListener react when a bundle with an entry in /META-INF/services/ is loaded into the OSGi runtime environment.\r\n\r\nIn short, you can move the bundle to a new module and the function will be preserved without problems.

Please look at the last commit the following description.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/78/commits/0a12d8ff9d4d8d4afda441e0ccfe2e769004628a\r\n\r\n**It is not a breaking change anymore!**\r\n\r\nIn the last commit (last section of squashed commit), the GSON library was integrated into the JClouds core module using maven-bundle plugins include resource instruction. Building OSGi instruction variables from the respective modules show a weakness when resources such as script builder shell scripts are required to be integrated into the bundle but not provide a dedicated variable declaration for the resource section.\r\n\r\nThe following commit demonstrates a change in strategy in declaration and integration of OSGi metadata.\r\n\r\n- Replace old bundle-plugin with newest bnd-plugin (bundle-plugin uses bnd-plugin internally)\r\n- Move OSGi metadata declarations from a maven variable passing strategy into dedicated bnd.bnd files\r\n+ Cleaner pom files, no bundle packaging\r\n+ Intellisense / Autocomplete support for .bnd files in terms of package exports etc.\r\n\r\nFor demonstration, the overall OSGi adjustments are limited to project, core, script builder, compute, blob store, and load balancer because most custom OSGi metadata is defined here.\r\n\r\nNote: Other modules are currently disabled from build because some feedback is needed first. When the changes does qualify for merge I create another merge request which re-enables all modules with the new OSGi bundling changes applied. My primary reason for temporally disabling those other modules is that basically any module pom is touched, and a separate bnd file is required. To understand the changes for GSON would be not that reasonable and easy to understand when pulling changes of 176 files in total into this merge request.\r\n\r\nMake GSON integration work.\r\nTo understand the changes, see the core modules' bnd file. GSON internal packages also define a version, which is taken from the GSON dependency. Both, in GSON already exported packages and additional export declarations are fused in the process. The global JClouds core module exports next to its own packages the entire set of GSON packages, including internal packages.\r\n\r\nSome minor modifications were made in the module project; replace maven jar plugin with a minified version of the declaration, outsourced in projects bnd file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3057\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-07-02 at 11 58 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/301689/86345629-12fff980-bc5c-11ea-9a93-a0617a7870fd.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/652886362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/653941801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/78#issuecomment-653941801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/78","id":653941801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Mzk0MTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"nacx","id":446705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjcwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/446705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx","html_url":"https://github.com/nacx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-05T21:32:41Z","updated_at":"2020-07-05T21:32:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So, the idea is that the jclouds-core OSGi module can export the son package we want instead of having them directly exported by the gson dependency itself?

To understand the changes for GSON would be not that reasonable and easy to understand when pulling changes of 176 files in total into this merge request.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/654650576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/681975285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/75#issuecomment-681975285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/75","id":681975285,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MTk3NTI4NQ==","user":{"login":"cdancy","id":7871459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzE0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7871459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy","html_url":"https://github.com/cdancy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdancy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-27T14:13:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T14:13:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gaul @nacx any chance we can get a new release with this fix?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/681975285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/comments/682237714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jclouds/pull/75#issuecomment-682237714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jclouds/issues/75","id":682237714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjIzNzcxNA==","user":{"login":"gaul","id":848247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul","html_url":"https://github.com/gaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-27T23:15:00Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T23:15:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Probably a few months.

However, if Apache Brooklyn and JClouds are run in an OSGi runtime environment, and Apache Karaf in particular, there may be some kind of incompatibility.\r\n\r\nI did a little digging in Apache Brooklyn and found references in one of the git submodules, that Apache Karaf-JClouds features are loaded and started.\r\n\r\nHere is the reference to the corresponding file\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/brooklyn-server/blob/ba7fb9112623872de18bd7b6135fdfc1014228ae/karaf/features/src/main/feature/feature.xml\r\n\r\nPer se this is no problem, but Apache Karaf-Jclouds project is on a very old state, which does not map dependencies of newer Apache JClouds versions.\r\n\r\nThe stack and libraries used in Apache JClouds change over time; consequently, the feature set provided by Apache Karaf-JClouds becomes incompatible over time. The creation of Apache Karaf features is mostly a manual process; it simply does not keep runtime dependencies up to date.\r\n\r\nPossible solution\r\nWhen I made the GSON handling changes in June, I created an automatic feature generator and aligned the outdated Apache Karaf-JClouds project with it.

You are right, the only thing that is happening is a re-export of GSON packages, nothing more. The footnote of yours in response to my estimation is in a practical environment much harder to validate. I think OSGi implementations are not perfect, especially in edge cases like that.\r\n\r\nI changed my opinion about which version of GSON we should use in this feature, to make sure we really introduce no side effects on a JDK level. We should go with 2.8.5. Anyway, I would like to introduce a conditional build profile to support JDK 11 and above, here we could then easily set GSON to the 2.8.6 version.\r\n\r\nWe are not at the finished line, yet.
