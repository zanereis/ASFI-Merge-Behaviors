I think there's no need to register a clean-up timer for each record. In [TimeBoundedJoin](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-libraries/flink-table/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/table/runtime/join/TimeBoundedStreamJoin.scala), only the first timer is registered in the `processElement()` method and following timers are registered in a \"chained manner\" after each cleaning-up.\r\n\r\n2. Without holding back watermarks, the join results in the downstream operators may be taken as outdated (according to the different mechanisms for rowtime propagation), which makes the join operation less applicable. What do you think?\r\n\r\nBest, Xingcan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/431232789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/431236371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6809#issuecomment-431236371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6809","id":431236371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTIzNjM3MQ==","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T03:48:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T03:48:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pnowojski , thanks for reviews again! \r\n\r\nI have mainly two concerns of tests from comments.\r\n1.

The dependency of `RestOptions#ADDRESS` on `JobManagerOptions#ADDRESS` is not intended to be resolved in the scope of this issue. I think the changes of this PR do not make things worse and indeed solve the problem of deprecation warnings. Consequently, I would suggest that we address the disentanglement in a separate issue.

of the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/version.html#a6519), making a nontransient field transient is identical as removing a field from a class. What happens is that an earlier version won't find the field data in the serialized stream and will initialize the field with the default value (`null`). In general this is an incompatible change when relying on Java serialization, however in our case if `toString == null`, then we will simply regenerate the `toString` field when calling `toString`. Therefore, I think it is ok to merge this change. \r\n\r\nI will proceed with merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/431311897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/431318654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6881#issuecomment-431318654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6881","id":431318654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTMxODY1NA==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T10:27:20Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T10:27:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I had a first look at the important parts of the implementation, will need a more thorough second pass.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/431318654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/431389044","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6887#issuecomment-431389044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6887","id":431389044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTM4OTA0NA==","user":{"login":"link3280","id":13482005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDgyMDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13482005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280","html_url":"https://github.com/link3280","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/link3280/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-19T14:48:48Z","updated_at":"2018-10-19T14:48:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'd like to add some tests, but it seems that it's hard to expose the state of YARN containers in a UT, and writing an IT for this should be unworthy.

into a single task. It could, get splits auto checkpointed and simplify the currently complex JM. However, new nodes might introduce unexpected feature to the graph, and besides we have to implement some \"pull\" semantic for splits nodes.

However, currently not all subclass of InputSplitAssigner has the logic to ```simply return the InputSplits to the InputSplitAssigner```, such as ```LocatableInputSplitAssigner``` or any other ```customized InputSplitAssigner```.\r\n\r\n```simply return the InputSplits to the InputSplitAssigner``` also implies transaction between task and jobManager (maybe multiple one), we need to make sure the ```inputSplits``` get return to the ```InputSplitAssigner``` exactly once. what happened if we have speculative execution, which means two task consume the same set of InputSplits and but not fail at same time, does every InputSplitAssigner need to keep a list to deduplicate? what happened if the TM died or has network issue and InputSplit cannot be return?\r\n\r\nSave the ```InputSplits``` in executionVertex is a way to \"return\" it to ``` InputSplitAssigner```, the \"side effect\" of this implementation is that this also implies the ``` InputSplits``` will be handled by the same task (executionVertex). But this seams a simple and safe way to implement ```simply return the InputSplits to the InputSplitAssigner``` with transaction. \r\n\r\n@tillrohrmann, the above is my understanding, let you know if we are on the same page.
