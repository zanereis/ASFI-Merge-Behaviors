Do we have a RFC or a tracking issue that indicates where the Training support of TVM is going ?\r\n\r\nThere's no RFC up at the moment, but we've had some discussion threads (see https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/two-missing-pieces-for-training/10037 for example). I'm currently in the process of upstreaming general improvements (gradients, AD bug fixes / improvements, new training ops, other supporting changes like contrib library support) and longer term hoping to open source a proof-of-concept TVM training framework around Q3 (developed at OctoML). Would love to hear your thoughts and perhaps it would be worth opening a long term tracking/discussion thread for training related topics!\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/867054296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/867063664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8029#issuecomment-867063664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8029","id":867063664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzA2MzY2NA==","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T18:27:02Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T18:27:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And updated again, both to fix a few more issues that arose on `main`, and to ignore the warnings coming from `git describe` and `coremltools`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/867063664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/867092775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8312#issuecomment-867092775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8312","id":867092775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzA5Mjc3NQ==","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T19:14:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T19:15:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CI failed on this one, due to a timeout.

And when `reduction=\"mean\"` or `reduction=\"sum\"`, `T` will be reduced, whereas when `reduction=\"none\"`, the `T` will be returned as the result of the `nll_loss`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as `nll_loss` is registered to use reduce schedule, when `reduction=\"mean\"` or `\"sum\"`, the `T` will go through the checks in `traverse_before_reduce` while when `reduction=\"none\"`, `T` will go through checks in `traverse_after_reduce`. Right now, the `kBroadcast` happens to be the only tag to satisfiy both checks and passed the CI .

Would you be up for doing that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/869902846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/869949125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7983#issuecomment-869949125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7983","id":869949125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTk0OTEyNQ==","user":{"login":"tkonolige","id":1501680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1501680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige","html_url":"https://github.com/tkonolige","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkonolige/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T19:10:18Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T19:10:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leandron @tqchen @areusch Can you review?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/869949125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/869972638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8096#issuecomment-869972638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8096","id":869972638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTk3MjYzOA==","user":{"login":"giuseros","id":2017147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTcxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros","html_url":"https://github.com/giuseros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T19:37:48Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T19:37:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @areusch , I can reuse that in theory, but `TempStorageInfo` is only a local structure used to have on-demand memory allocation, i.e.,  I don't need to pass the `TempStorageInfo` around. This was the reason you suggested to not use struct of arrays here: https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8096#discussion_r638171243. I personally agreed with your comment and would prefer the way it is (i.e., array of structs), because using a struct of arrays makes the code less readable. However, if you guys feel strongly about reusing the `StorageInfo` struct of arrays, I can surely do it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/869972638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/870050776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8313#issuecomment-870050776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8313","id":870050776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MDA1MDc3Ng==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T21:19:02Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T21:20:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not exactly, but I've dealt with a similar issue.
