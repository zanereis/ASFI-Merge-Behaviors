The reason we are are making this configurable is so that we can easier test this in Ansible by throwing both errors and valid telemetry into the same topic.  In production we would not do this and would have a dedicated topic and a dedicated topology to error writing with parallelism tuned way down to prioritize ingest of actual valid telemetry over errors.  The writing topology should attempt to write errors from the queue exactly to either ES, HDFS, or both exactly once.  If it cannot do that then it should ping whatever infrastructure monitoring component that you are using that your ES or HDFS is down.  That, however, is a different PR and is out of context here.  I will need to file this PR as follow-on work.  \r\n\r\nWith that said, I personally see no problem with the way this PR is implemented.  It allows for a dedicated topic and writing of errors into ES or HDFS exactly once if running in production setting.  There is an option to configure the topic so you can have telemetry and errors in the same topic for testing on Ansible.  So +1 from me\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/283718576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/283748490","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/468#issuecomment-283748490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/468","id":283748490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4Mzc0ODQ5MA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T19:08:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T19:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 tested this in Vagrant quick-dev.\r\n\r\n@cestella I'm good with waiting on the default dir.

In reality, that was always the case. If the Hadoop deployment failed, that was where you looked. If the probes failed to start, you checked Monit. Ansible alerted you to the fact of the failure, but anything but the simplest required poking around Ambari/Monit/Command Line.\r\n\r\nIt sounds to me like you'd like to revisit the decision to reduce reliance on Ansible. If that's the case, we can certainly do that. I thought we had consensus but maybe we don't. Maybe we need to go back to the discuss thread?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/284757324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/284761221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/459#issuecomment-284761221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/459","id":284761221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDc2MTIyMQ==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T15:50:38Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T15:50:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 on this.

Thanks for the fix @dlyle65535 \r\n\r\nI have been fighting a bit with the AWS deployment.  I ran into two issues.\r\n\r\n(1)   On one pass the setup of Ambari seems to fail, but the deployment continued, which causes it to fail later on in the deployment.  To fix, I manually logged into the host and ran the Ambari setup and then re-ran the deployment which addressed the problem.\r\n\r\nI am almost certain that I have seen this before prior to the work in this PR.  \r\n```\r\n$ ./run.sh\r\n...\r\n\r\nTASK [ambari_master : Setup ambari server] *************************************\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"Successfully downloaded JDK distribution to /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/jdk-8u77-linux-x64.tar.gz\", \"Installing JDK to /usr/jdk64/\", \"Successfully installed JDK to /usr/jdk64/\", \"Downloading JCE Policy archive from http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/ARTIFACTS/jce_policy-8.zip to /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/jce_policy-8.zip\", \"\", \"Successfully downloaded JCE Policy archive to /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/jce_policy-8.zip\", \"Installing JCE policy...\", \"Completing setup...\", \"Configuring database...\", \"Enter advanced database configuration [y/n] (n)? \", \"Configuring database...\", \"Default properties detected.

On all but one of the 10 AWS nodes, the deployment went smoothly.  At some point during the deployment, Ansible could not talk to one node, but it continued on anyways.  After the 9 were finished, Ambari showed all 10 nodes, except the one, which it showed in yellow indicating that it could not get a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nAfter Ansible was done with the 9 nodes, it then seemed to almost start over on the last node.  It went and rebuilt the source code, pushed out the RPMs, reinstalled the MPack, etc.  That really confused the cluster and it has not processed any data.  \r\n\r\nI'm sure a little manual effort could fix-up the cluster, but the behavior of Ansible was weird.  Before when I've worked with the AWS deployment, it would fail if any one node failed.  Now it seems to retry failed nodes at a later point in time, which has some negative implications when we expect actions like the build, mpack install, etc to only occur once.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to make of this issue.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/284875738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/284877838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/436#issuecomment-284877838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/436","id":284877838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDg3NzgzOA==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T22:15:45Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T22:15:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis failure.

The slowest part of spinning this up is downloading the kafka and hbase distributions.  What would you think of splitting these Dockerfiles into 2 separate images:  one with just the service installed (kafka or hbase) and another that extends the service and installs the Metron bits on top?  This would allow us to quickly deploy Metron changes and rebuild.  To get that to work we would need to a way to get the base image installed locally.  Initially this could just be a build script that needs to be run once before spinning the application up and long term it could live in Docker Hub.  \r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this idea?  Would it be helpful?  I'm a little hesitant to add a manual step that needs to be done before the application will work and adding that hook into the build process is out of the question.

Javadoc takes a little longer, I think, but is also important to keep clean.  Is there something like \"-DskipSite\" that prevents all three (site, site-book, and javadocs) from being built, if a developer wants to skip them?\r\n\r\nRegarding the integration, what most projects do is, as part of their Site's documentation area, there is one or more pull-down menus, or a landing page, where you can choose the VERSION you want of:\r\n* Documentation (site-book, in our case)\r\n* Release Notes\r\n* Javadocs\r\n\r\nThis implies that the Site needs a *cumulative* store of past release Doc builds, and that part of the Release Manager's job is adding each new release to that store.  Since it keeps getting larger and larger, storing it in github master (where Site lives) may not be the best thing.  Rather, it could go under https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/metron/ (release -> dev, during votes).  The cost of this is a manual step instead of automated, for the Release Manager.\r\n\r\nThe Site menu would then link into the many doc sets in the store.  Given the regular naming of the paths, we could actually have each release contain its own doc set (only) at a standard place, which is consistent with it being part of the build, and then the Site's menu would have a list of links that differ only by a version number.  The RM would make the one-line edit to add each new doc set as it is released.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThe tickets, btw, are [METRON-759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-759) and [METRON-718](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-718).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/285159063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/285332127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/436#issuecomment-285332127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/436","id":285332127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTMzMjEyNw==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-09T11:54:55Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T11:54:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@justinleet - that last commit adds the quotation requiremnt to the tool tip.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/285332127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/285435101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/475#issuecomment-285435101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/475","id":285435101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTQzNTEwMQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-09T18:19:59Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T18:19:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 by inspection, great job @justinleet ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/285435101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
