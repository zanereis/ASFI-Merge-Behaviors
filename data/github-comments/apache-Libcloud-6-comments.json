The idea was that you could just put in real provider credentials and the tests would run against a live installation.\n\nSadly that's easier said than done. A lot of tests for edge cases rely on an account being in specific state which means they won't work against a live installation. Making tests work against a live installation, would at this point, require a substantial amount of work with changes to the existing tests.\n\nOne thing we could do is use a more gradual approach and start working on a separate integration test suite. This way we would have two independent test suites (unit & integration). With this approach we might trade long term overhead of maintaining two test suites for short term flexibility and speed, but it's probably worth

They pass `node` object to the driver method, but the driver method doesn't take a node object.\n\nSee:\n- https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/cloudstack.py#L39 \n- https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/cloudstack.py#L828\n\nWe have two options:\n1. Fix those methods to actually do what the docstring says - allocate the IP **and bind it to the node**\n2.  Remove those methods from the `CloudStackNode` class since in the current form, they don't belong there.\n\nWe also need better test coverage to detect issues like this automatically in the future.\n\nEdit: I've opened a JIRA issue for it - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-462.
