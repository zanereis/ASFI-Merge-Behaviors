I checked the Github diff but did not notice that the file was omitted, hence my question.\n\nI'm splitting the NetworkOrchestrator related commits (formatting and fixing) so you can analyse the changes.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/169928856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/169931078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1150#issuecomment-169931078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1150","id":169931078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTkzMTA3OA==","user":{"login":"nitin-maharana","id":12583725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgzNzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12583725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana","html_url":"https://github.com/nitin-maharana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T08:27:10Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T08:27:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR as made a new PR #1320 (Against 4.7 which will be merged in master later).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/169931078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/169931271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1320#issuecomment-169931271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1320","id":169931271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTkzMTI3MQ==","user":{"login":"nitin-maharana","id":12583725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTgzNzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12583725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana","html_url":"https://github.com/nitin-maharana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nitin-maharana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T08:28:23Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T08:28:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reference PR #1150 (Against 4.6).

Deploy a DC\n2. Create a VPC + Tier + VM\n3. Change the GC settings for 10 seconds, for example\n4. Restart the Management Server\n5. Remove the VM from the tier\n6. Observe if the Network GC is actually running every 10 seconds - as now defined in the DB - or if it is still using the 600 seconds hardcoded in the nested Enum.\n\nThat's why a changed it. I needed to make sure that the changes applied in the global settings would be retrieved from the Database. But don't bother, it's already deployed in our production here and working really nice.\n\nConcerning gradually refactoring code, I agree with that - I'm not an idiot. Actually, I have done a lot of refactoring on ACS since I started. I haven't been adding glue to things or not writing tests. But in that case, the whole configuration is messed and I don't agree with someone adding separate things to classes and letting them be for years.\n\nIf for some reason I did not get the way it should work, you can do one of two things:\n1. Mark the PR with a -1; or\n2. Checkout the code; fix the way you want; make sure the tests passes; and push a PR on top of this one.\n\nHave a happy

It also seems to me that the margin applied here is the proper size to allow for a slightly more brand measure without being large to the point of compromising test accuracy to a great degree. Code LGTM too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/170381531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/170385290","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1324#issuecomment-170385290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1324","id":170385290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDM4NTI5MA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-10T19:55:06Z","updated_at":"2016-01-10T19:55:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"validating by compile:\n\n``````\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time: 12:00 min\n[INFO] Finished at: 2016-01-10T20:48:34+01:00\n[INFO] Final Memory: 114M/813M\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n``` LGTM\npinging RM @remibergsma \n``````\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/170385290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/170387660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/969#issuecomment-170387660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/969","id":170387660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDM4NzY2MA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-10T20:07:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-10T20:07:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"it zooming.
