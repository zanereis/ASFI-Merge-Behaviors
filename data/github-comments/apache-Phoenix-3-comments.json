Added a few questions and comments to the PR.  \n\nThere is one more issue that it not tackled here that we need to at least discuss IMHO. Phoenix's metadata tables, such as SYSTEM.CATALOG lead with TENANT_ID VARCHAR column (take a look in QueryConstants.java). This works well in a world where all multi-tenant tables can only have VARCHAR tenant id columns. Your changes introduce the possibility that different multi-tenant tables will have different types of tenant id columns.\n\nWhat's the right solution here? The correct thing is probably changing TENANT_ID column type to BINARY in system tables, as well as adding a TENANT_ID_TYPE column to allow tenant ids to be converted correctly. But that will make upgrades for existing clusters a pain.

I have to say I'm still torn on whether or not this Jira makes much sense. What if I told you that your concern #2 is already addressed? Currently tenant id columns can be either VARCHAR or fixed-length CHAR. Does that make it easier for you to use multi-tenancy in Phoenix?\n\nRegarding your points #1 and 3, you are forced to do the conversion once per Connection when you set the TenantId parameter either way. Not sure what kind of conversion you mean beyond that. Normally when you read/write via a tenant-specific connection you only set TenantId on the Connection and don't need to actually write it or read it. Are you working with this data over non-tenant-specific connections?\n\n---\n\nI went though your code again. Everything looks good. The only thing missing now is:\n1. Tests that create tenant views with non-string tenant id columns and test data upsertion/retrieval.\n2. Same as above but negative.

length of the ImmutableByteWritable is equal to byte[] contained in it.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\nAnd also I have fixed the failure test cases as well. there was logical operator problem while incrementing \nguidePosts till the start key.\n\nI have run the complete test suite now and will confirm you once it is completed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/172089737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/172148769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/147#issuecomment-172148769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/147","id":172148769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjE0ODc2OQ==","user":{"login":"JamesRTaylor","id":6176299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzYyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6176299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesRTaylor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesRTaylor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-16T02:43:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-16T02:43:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks
