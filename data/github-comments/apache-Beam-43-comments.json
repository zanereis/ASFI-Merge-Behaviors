My scenario is this:\n\nI'm running a lot GCP services via Airflow (DataProc, BigQuery, Storage and DataFlow). They are all running in a Kubernetes cluster using a service-key generated via the console (JSON file). The problem I have is that the containers don't have gcloud command installed, so I need to pass the service-key (JSON) file as a parameter to the jar (I'm always packing everything in a single JAR), but currently there is only support for the P12 (old keyfiles).

I generally agree, but since the DStream/RDD API are separate APIs (reusable to some extent, with further limitations once checkpointing is enabled) you'll end up asking this wrapper (for example, in streaming pipelines that have \"batch/bounded\" branches)  if it's a DStream or an RDD in order to address the appropriate `TransformTranslator` and pcollections map.\nThe current status duplicates code, which I'm not thrilled about, but keeps a good separation between streaming and batch translations.\n\nWould your suggestion be relevant as part of future work following this PR, or will it require another/different refactor of the translation mechanism
