I will fork or wrap as necessary. Keep it in mind, and maybe in a 2.x release this can be revisited. (Matei I ran into more problems with the `Rating` class retrofit anyway.)\n\nYes storage is the downside. Your comments on JIRA about effects of serialization in compressing away the difference are promising. I completely agree with using `Float` for ratings and even feature vectors.\n\nYes I understand why random projections are helpful. It doesn't help accuracy, but may only trivially hurt it in return for some performance gain. If I have just 1 rating, it doesn't make my recs better to arbitrarily add your ratings to mine. Sure that's denser, and maybe you're getting less overfitting, but it's fitting the wrong input for both of us.\n\nA collision here and there is probably acceptable. One in a million customers? OK. 1%? maybe a problem. I agree, you'd have to quantify this to decide. If I'm an end user of MLlib bringing even millions of things to my model, I have to decide. And if it's a problem, have to maintain a lookup table to use it.\n\nIt seemed simplest to moot the problem with a much bigger key space and engineer around the storage issue. A bit more memory is cheap; accuracy and engineer time are expensive. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49149396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49153027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-49153027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":49153027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTUzMDI3","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T11:30:50Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T11:30:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mridulm @lirui-intel I separated the noPref tasks and those with the unavailable preference....this will treat the tasks with the unavailable preference as non-local ones before their preferences become available....\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49153027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49153988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1244#issuecomment-49153988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1244","id":49153988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTUzOTg4","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T11:43:21Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T11:43:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@andrewor14 yeah, I agree with you, I just thought in somewhere (document in the earlier versions?

If/when a node/rack local host pops in, it becomes eligible for better schedule preference.\n\n@CodingCat, @kayousterhout @lirui-intel any thoughts ?

This is because in TaskSetManager we take the preferredLocality and make it no bigger than our allowed locality level based on delays. The unit tests seem to add extra sleeps for this reason.\n\nI don't really like this behavior, since with both kind of tasks you'd like to launch them as soon as possible. No-prefs tasks can just run, and for speculative tasks you want to launch them ASAP in situations like Spark Streaming, where a 3-second delay could mess up your stream latency.\n\nIt might be better to add a special \"preferredLocality\" value for no preference, and always call the TaskSetManager with that value after calling it with the others, then have a code path in there that deals with that specially (not taking the min of that with allowedLocality).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49205621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49205693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1313#issuecomment-49205693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1313","id":49205693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjA1Njkz","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T18:19:41Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T18:19:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

We only wait when we move up a level.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49210568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49210831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1393#issuecomment-49210831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1393","id":49210831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjEwODMx","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-16T18:58:27Z","updated_at":"2014-07-16T18:58:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, that's what I meant, we can clone it at first but we might be able to share code later (at least the math code we run on each block, or stuff like that).
