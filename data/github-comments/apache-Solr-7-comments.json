I find having `doDeleteById` call `doDeleteByQuery` to be way too kludgy (and you admitted as much in JIRA).  It appears that this works almost accidentally, and is thus fragile and perhaps internally slower than it could be.  It seems the logic should go into `doDistribDeleteById`.\r\n\r\nBut firstly, I'm confused about how this PR relates to the JIRA issue.  The JIRA issue clearly states this issue occurs when the implicit router is being used.  Yet the test here and the fix use/check-for the CompositeIdRouter.

I think this is doable in authorization..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/948521927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/948888947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/307#issuecomment-948888947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/307","id":948888947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM44juVz","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T18:23:51Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T18:23:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've tried to remove the whitespace, with no luck...

My rationale is that this is just a refactoring.  I set out for the dependencies to be the same in the end but there are a couple minor tweaks I'm aware of as evidenced in this PR -- kerby-kdc isn't needed (transitive to Hadoop stuff), nor is eigenbase-properties (transitive to Calcite stuff).  I suspect these were dependencies that may have been required at some point but after an upgrade and now aren't, or maybe they never were.  Tests pass -- hopefully a good enough check.  We have other transitive dependencies from Calcite that I suspect we don't need either (protobuf and esri stuff) that I could exclude but didn't because my objective here is not to go pruning the project's dependencies, yet I admit I in effect did this with two above.  So; should I declare explicit dependencies to bring back what we might not need, leaving pruning for another issue that could have a bigger scope?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/949042358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/949060142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/193#issuecomment-949060142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/193","id":949060142,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM44kYIu","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T22:53:56Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T22:53:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see you are awaiting my review on this.

I can now see the local deletion happening on all the nodes, all the way down to DirectUpdateHandler2.delete, but the deletion doesn't happen. This isn't completely surprising, because even now if the receiving node is the shard leader of the correct shard and the route is missing, the local delete still appears to happen on the shard leader and follower but ultimately the deletion fails without error, at least in my test it does. I think if I could discern why it still fails even though the local deletion appears to be happening, that this would be the correct approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/950160336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/950212191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/288#issuecomment-950212191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/288","id":950212191,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM44oxZf","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-23T20:39:37Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T20:39:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I've added some logic in the doDistribDeleteById for Phase=NONE to also distribute to request to the leaders of the other shards if the route is missing, which is more along the lines of David Smiley's suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf you do that and the test fails (presumably), I could help debug to see why.\r\n\r\nIn terms of reviewers, I think @hossman would be a good choice based on him touching the same test very recently in SOLR-8889 to fix similar-ish bugs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/950212191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/950343090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/364#issuecomment-950343090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/364","id":950343090,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM44pRWy","user":{"login":"ctargett","id":450148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDE0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/450148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett","html_url":"https://github.com/ctargett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctargett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T15:17:51Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T15:17:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I actually wanted to rename this page to simply \"Solr SQL\" -
