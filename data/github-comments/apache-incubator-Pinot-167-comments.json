Jackie, getting to this a little late.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the code at all yet, but is there a way we could make these \"async task\" APIs more generically implemented in the backend.

I wonder if there's a way to make this easier in Pinot itself rather than trying to string together something to approximate the state you're looking for.

What exactly are we after? Is it code cleanup? To propose to deprecate an API one day after it was added does seem strange. Is it only metrics APIs that you are concerned with, or are you going to clean up a lot of code here?\r\n\r\nThe goal is to revise the current gauge metrics. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, there is a `_gaugeValues` variable in defined in `org.apache.pinot.common.metrics.AbstractMetrics`, which is a walk around to make gauge value changable. \r\n1/ This solution is not consistent with how metric and timer are implemented, which relies purely on metric registry\r\n2/ when we update gauges, we are updating `_gaugeValues`, but not gauges in metric registry directly. I discovered gauge discrepencies in some test cases\r\n3/ `_gaugeValues` solves the problem that a gauge value cannot be updated, but it does not solve the problem that a gauge `callable` cannot be updated\r\n4/ methods with name `callback` are not accurate.\r\n\r\nI had a PR (https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9961) to make gauge updatable. With that, we can now get rid of `_gaugeValues` and fix the above problems. I am now doing this step by step.\r\n\r\nTo answer your questions:\r\n1/ it is not only code clean up, but also fixing some issues.\r\n2/ We are making changes simutenously, so there are some conflicts (that's why we have discussions here) That cause `deprecate an API one day after it was added does seem strange` (BTW, I didn't pay too much attention on when some APIs were added)\r\n3/ It's not only about API, but also logic clean up. However, there will not be a lot of code here.\r\n\r\nI am happy to set up a meeting to discuss those in more details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1381196926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1381416171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10122#issuecomment-1381416171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10122","id":1381416171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5SVrzr","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-13T07:24:15Z","updated_at":"2023-01-18T10:16:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10122?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10122](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10122?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (5066375) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/8022c792f10c997335f510f1eea426ffc27468b5?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (8022c79) will **decrease** coverage by `1.93%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10122      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.41%   68.48%   -1.93%     \n+ Complexity     5745     5125     -620     \n============================================\n  Files          1992     2000       +8     \n  Lines        107981   108476     +495     \n  Branches      16415    16484      +69     \n============================================\n- Hits          76031    74291    -1740     \n- Misses        26630    28899    +2269     \n+ Partials       5320     5286      -34     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `24.67% <ø> (+0.02%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `67.80% <ø> (-0.22%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `13.67% <ø> (-0.02%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

Your points make a lot of sense!\r\n\r\nWe definitely do not want to break production system using current metrics! What I did (see my previous PRs) and will do is to deprecate old methods (but I will not change or remove publicly available methods, except for those marking as visible for testing) and add new ones. \r\n\r\nWe know that the migration from old methods to new ones will not happen over night and will take time. Util new methods are verified in production and we are confident, we will not replace old ones with new ones.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1382287559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1382337904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10088#issuecomment-1382337904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10088","id":1382337904,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5SZM1w","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-13T20:10:00Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T20:10:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please
