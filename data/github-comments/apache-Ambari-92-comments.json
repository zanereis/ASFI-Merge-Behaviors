I was going through the PR and had a few suggestions/ doubts. \r\nI see that you are adding Router as a separate service in Ambari. Essentially Router is a HDFS component only. Could you please  tell the reason for this approach. Because we are still going to store the configuration file for Router under hadoop_conf directory only.\r\n\r\nAlso if you could please tell how the following things will be taken care of in your approach:\r\n\r\n- how is it being made sure that client requests are being routed via the Router in single and multi router setup\r\n- there are a certain set of configurations that are required as per the hadoop community for managing multi-router setup. How will we support those configurations\r\n- Router is made a master so the cardinality will be +1. But the user should not have the ability to add router without enabling multiple namespaces. Don't you think this should be integrated as part of Ambari federation setup only as Router installation then can be controlled.\r\n- Some router based configurations like the registering nameservice should be and can done automatically by Ambari as it is aware of the multiple namespaces in the cluster. Then why do we need to include those configurations in the hdfs-rbf-site. These configurations should only be loaded when multiple namespaces exist in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2072920519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2073814703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3782#issuecomment-2073814703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3782","id":2073814703,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c57m-av","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-24T01:31:40Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T01:31:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AnanyaSingh2121 \r\nThank you for your feedback. Let me address your questions:\r\n\r\n1. **Why treat the router as a separate service?**\r\nAlthough the router is part of the Hadoop source code, from an architectural standpoint, in a federated cluster, the router cluster operates independently from any specific Hadoop cluster, representing a routing layer. Thus, I believe it's inappropriate to associate the router with any particular Hadoop cluster during deployment. Moreover, having the router deployed independently allows for more flexible and clearer scalability and maintenance. To transition a cluster into a federated cluster, one simply needs to add a router and modify a few configurations. If a cluster with a router wishes to dismount from a federated setup and return to being an independent cluster, this can easily be done by uninstalling the router service and adjusting the current Hadoop configurations, which keeps the coupling low.\r\n\r\n2. **About routing client requests to clusters and the configuration:**\r\nAfter deploying the router and configuring it to monitor the current cluster, along with modifying the cluster's hdfs-site, then you can perform directory mounts using `dfsrouteradmin` from the command line. Clients access using the `core-site` and `hdfs-site` configurations. By modifying the configuration, all client configurations can point to the router cluster.\r\n\r\n3. **On your third point:**\r\nThat's a great idea. It requires coordination with the frontend. Perhaps we can iterate over it step by step; achieving perfection right away is challenging.\r\n\r\n4. **Regarding the router `service_advisor` you mentioned:**\r\nIf you're interested, you might consider submitting a PR to address

I have some more feedback.\r\n\r\n- Ideally we will not have  a federated cluster without Router as to manage Federation we will be using Router only. So installing it as a separate separate does not provide the required decoupling. Once federation is enabled Router is a requirement. So it does not make sense to just delete Router. If Router needs to be uninstalled then federation also will have to disabled. We cannot separate the two in my opinion.\r\n\r\n- About the client requests, yes you are correct we will have to eventually modify the core-site and hdfs-site. So better to have all the conf files at one place. Also my concern was regarding managing multiple Routers as in that case you will not be able to modify the default Fs to one Router rpc. For this purpose Hadoop community proposes ns-fed a logical namespace for router. That will require testing in Ambari as those configurations will give rise to conflict. Hadoop community has also raised a jira for the same.\r\n\r\n- Also we have developed and tested the Router based federation with Router as component of HDFS. We have also included several UI changes where Router can be enabled as part of Federation flow. Will be raising a jira for the same and submit a patch. \r\n\r\nRequest your inputs also on the same.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2079794895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080308226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3782#issuecomment-2080308226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3782","id":2080308226,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c57_vwC","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-27T01:41:58Z","updated_at":"2024-04-27T01:41:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AnanyaSingh2121 \r\nI believe decoupling is necessary, and I'm not clear how you enabled federation, whether modifying the Hadoop configuration or restarting the cluster is required. However, by making the router standalone, testing does not require any changes to the current Hadoop cluster configuration to enable federation.\r\n\r\n1. First, we can enable federation on an existing cluster without altering any Hadoop cluster configurations, making federation implementation impact-free for this cluster. It only requires modifying the router to monitor this Hadoop. Therefore, to enable federation for a cluster, one just needs to deploy a router, monitor the NameNode address, set up a common zookeeper and namespace, and then mount it. If we want to separate this cluster from the federated cluster for independent use, only uninstalling this router is needed, likewise without any modifications or restarts required for this existing Hadoop cluster.\r\n\r\nI think we should distinguish between client and server configurations. Ambari lacks a feature, which is differentiating Hadoop's client configurations from server configurations. After enabling federation, only client configurations need to be modified without conflicting, as the server-side configurations remain unchanged. Client configurations are provided to other big data components for reading. Alternatively, maintain a separate set of federated client configurations manually for other components.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling federation, server-side configurations remain unchanged:\r\nI provide a client configuration:\r\ndfs.nameservices=ns-fed\r\ndfs.namenode.rpc-address.ns-fed.r1=your router1 address\r\ndfs.namenode.rpc-address.ns-fed.r2=your router2 address\r\ndfs.namenode.rpc-address.ns-fed.rn=your routern address\r\n\r\nfs.defaultFS=hdfs://ns-fed\r\nThis way, all users utilizing this client configuration will access the federation.\r\n\r\nIf enabling or disabling federation requires restarting the entire cluster, it would be intolerable for an existing cluster running a significant volume of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems you have developed a more comprehensive router solution. You can open a new issue and submit a PR. I will consider closing this PR accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080308226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080318407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3783#issuecomment-2080318407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3783","id":2080318407,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c57_yPH","user":{"login":"virajjasani","id":34790606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzkwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani","html_url":"https://github.com/virajjasani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-27T02:03:42Z","updated_at":"2024-04-27T02:03:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zRains your jira account is created?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080318407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080321888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3783#issuecomment-2080321888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3783","id":2080321888,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c57_zFg","user":{"login":"zRains","id":16508606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTA4NjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16508606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains","html_url":"https://github.com/zRains","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zRains/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-27T02:14:25Z","updated_at":"2024-04-27T02:14:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@virajjasani I have submitted a request for creation, but it appears it has not yet been approved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080321888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2080322869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3783#issuecomment-2080322869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3783","id":2080322869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c57_zU1","user":{"login":"virajjasani","id":34790606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzkwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani","html_url":"https://github.com/virajjasani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-27T02:16:52Z","updated_at":"2024-04-27T02:16:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No worries, it will get approved soon.

This project is mainly maintained within Apache Bigtop. Any new services added here are managed by Bigtop; our task here is only service management.\r\n\r\nThe CI failure issue has been around for a while and wasn't caused by my PR; it's due to a Jenkins configuration problem. I'm trying to fix it together with Virajjasani, but I don't have the permission to modify or view the Jenkins files. If you can help, that would be great.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3788#issuecomment-2192995677\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/18082602/78f5baa6-189f-4377-b0ba-74eef361ebf4)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2212732109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2219758301","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3793#issuecomment-2219758301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3793","id":2219758301,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c6ETtLd","user":{"login":"JiaLiangC","id":18082602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDgyNjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18082602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiangC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiangC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-10T07:27:41Z","updated_at":"2024-07-10T07:27:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n@virajjasani
