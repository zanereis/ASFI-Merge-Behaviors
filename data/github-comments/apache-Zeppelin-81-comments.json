And it is not something that we want add here (we want  self-contained `IpfsNotebookRepo` implementation)  \n\nI think what you could do here is - create a [new REST API endpoint](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/rest/NotebookRestApi.java), pass this hash (which is like an URL in our case) to this REST API, and make it delegate actual fetching logic to a method in `IpfsNotebookRepo` and then, on the client, just rear the response, as a JSON.\n\nThis logic can be later used for BitTorrent notebooks storage support as well as simple URL case could be refactored to use it (but that is outside of the scope of this PR of course) \n\nLet me introduce you to @corneadoug - he is known Zeppelin front-end ninja, whose knowledge of the client side codebase is by far greater than mine.\n\n@corneadoug Could you please help @onkarshedge and guide him on refactoring\\updating `notenameImport.controller.js` in such way, that it could delegate hash->JSON resolution in case of notebook import to the backend API, for the case of importing notes from new IPFS storage by IPFS hash (which is like a bittorent address)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238463347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238466797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1248#issuecomment-238466797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1248","id":238466797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODQ2Njc5Nw==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T06:39:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T06:39:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mwkang

giving some context\n1. this is not about whole `NotebookRepo` api, it's related to only one method [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/repo/NotebookRepo.java#L92)\n2. the clients identified correctly (`NotebookServer` and `Notebook`)\n\nSo the question was that given current api as follows : \n`get(String noteId, Revision rev, AuthenticationInfo subject)` \nhow can we improve it? as you can see, Revision contains `id` as well as other constructs representing additional information about `Revision`, however in `get` we need only id. \n\nfurther given your feedback from #1254  [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1254#issuecomment-236475181) : \n\n> Also, could you please explain why do you think this API change is valuable and what benefits does it bring for a user? (i.e does it consider other possible versioned storage i.e IPFS, BitTorrent and other future ones, where just an ID might not be enough? or it might be not String)\n\nNow, I tried to address that problem here by adding `RevisionId<?>` which is used by clients (`NotebookServer`, `Notebook`) without knowledge of inner representation (placeholder `?`), and only on repo level each `NotebookRepo` deals with his own type of `RevisionId` (say `RevisionId<String>`). The only drawback is usage of `instanceof` here and possible diversion of `RevisionId`s for different repos. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238473950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238478061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1307#issuecomment-238478061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1307","id":238478061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODQ3ODA2MQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T07:43:20Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T07:43:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\\cc @Leemoonsoo @minahlee Is it possible to merge it into 0.6.1 ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238478061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238478472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1307#issuecomment-238478472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1307","id":238478472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODQ3ODQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T07:45:20Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T07:48:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zjffdu Thanks for the fix.

This allows only to store only one item/note against your public key. On retrieval the latest revision is retrieved, highest `seq` number. We can store multiple notes also if we use `salt`, the key in DHT would be hash(publicKey+salt), the salt could be `noteId`. But still we can only get only latest revision as per the protocol.\n\nIf we use Immutable items to be stored in DHT `dht.put(data)` returns SHA hash and we can get the item back from DHT via `dht.get(hash)`. So we can keep track of all revisions by storing hash against the noteID. `noteID -> [hash of rev1,hash of rev2]` in some Map<String,List<String>> . \n\npoint 4) Magnet Link.\nmagnet link are used to receive the metadata(info) of the .torrent file.Once the metadata part is received it downloads the file. In order for the peer to receive the file it needs seeders. Why use magnet link to import ? as we are storing notes directly in DHT we can just use hash(returned from dht.put(\"data\") ) to get it from DHT.\n\npoint 1) Listing existing notes\nwill this be VFSNotebookRepo's list() method ? I didn't get this one.\n\n--Edited---\nThe DHT supports storing of arbitrary data with less than 1000 bytes. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238506526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238506981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1307#issuecomment-238506981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1307","id":238506981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODUwNjk4MQ==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T09:52:36Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T09:52:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks great to me\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238506981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/238507500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1304#issuecomment-238507500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1304","id":238507500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODUwNzUwMA==","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-09T09:54:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T09:54:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@corneadoug thanks for taking care of this!

To do that, there is a websocket event that originally looked like that: `websocketMsgSrv.getNoteRevision($routeParams.noteId, $routeParams.revisionId);`\n\nAfter using it, it seemed that this websocket event was not well defined on front-end side and that instead of `revisionId` I should be sending the whole revision description object to the backend.\n\nWhich look like that:\n\n```\nrevision: {\ntimestamp,\ntext,\nrevisionId\n}\n```\n\nNow, unless there is a whole object to save, there should not be any reason for the front-end to send a full object to the back-end so that it can understand which revision I want.

This complicates navigating the history of changes and makes 'git blame' less useful.\n\nWhat would be great if we could provide consistent formatters for IDEs first, advise everyone to use them AND then make mandatory style checks ONLY for the new code.\n\nI think this should be possible!
