second query to `configureproxy` already has the proxy set up and as such simple call to `url.openConnection();` succeeds but that doesn't mean we don't need a proxy. The check should be in my opinion replaced with `url.openConnection(Proxy.NO_PROXY);` - maybe that would also fix your problems...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/645885365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/645886613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2192#issuecomment-645886613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2192","id":645886613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTg4NjYxMw==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T09:05:45Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T09:05:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The other problem of current code is a race condition.

Yes, I agree. I think CSV is sufficient and easily convertible to xls/xlsx if someone needs it.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing I made some research.\r\n\r\nFor writing .xls files a good candidate is [jExcelApi](http://jexcelapi.sourceforge.net/). It is licensed under the LGPL license. Last version was in 2011 but .xls is a very old format and I guess there won't be any issue. As a drawback I read somewhere that it produces bigger .xls files than POI.\r\nFor writing .xlsx files a good candidate is [fastexcel](https://github.com/dhatim/fastexcel). It is supposed to handle big files efficiently. It is licensed under the Apache v2. As a project it seems to be active.\r\n\r\nIn general I don't think there will be any kind of functionality required that is not provided by these libraries. The export doesn't need any \"fancy\" excel feature. I made some quick tests and they seem sufficient.\r\n\r\nBoth libraries seem pretty small in size too.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that I am in favor of providing the csv/tsv option and additionally the .xlsx option by using **fastexcel**. Old .xls format was coming for free when using POI and code-wise it was pretty similar to .xlsx, so it made sense to export in that too. Now that we are talking about using two different libraries I think we can skip .xls support because the format is too old, the produced files are larger than .xlsx in general and I don't think adding it adds any actual value.\r\n\r\nOf course as I have already mentioned having only csv/tsv looks also good to me. I know that from a user perspective I personally would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/646330646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/646409610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2194#issuecomment-646409610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2194","id":646409610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjQwOTYxMA==","user":{"login":"BradWalker","id":930871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/930871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/BradWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-19T03:06:59Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T03:06:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Many of the changes aren't API changes (like changing local variables and private or package private field/method types).

But handling it via the require flag in FOD isn't the answer.  And unless we change how that works, it triggers loads of other issues.  It breaks import settings, open project and the options window, _sometimes even in cases where the user does download the modules_ (eg. [NETBEANS-3732](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-3732))  It also doesn't help if the user bypasses FOD by enabling the cluster directly, migrates from JDK 8, or if we don't ship a build with ergonomics.\r\n\r\nI think we need to rethink how to fix [NETBEANS-2439](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-2439), and any other time a feature / wizard has a hard requirement on an optional dependency.
