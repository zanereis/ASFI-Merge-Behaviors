I don't have access to that GCE environment anymore so I can't test, but I compared the August libcloud code to the current code and it doesn't seem like there were any changes to

resp:\r\n        for v in resp['items'].values():\r\n            for ig in v.get('instanceGroups', []):\r\n                if 'zone' in ig:\r\n                    try: instance_groups.append(gcp._to_instancegroup(ig))\r\n                    except:\r\n                        e = sys.exc_info()\r\n                        print('{}: instancegroup: {}'.format(\r\n                             projectid, e[1].value['message']), file=sys.stderr)\r\n                        if e[0] != libcloud.common.google.ResourceNotFoundError:\r\n                            raise\r\n    return instance_groups\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/568775782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/568792309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1394#issuecomment-568792309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1394","id":568792309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODc5MjMwOQ==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-24T19:06:42Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T19:06:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

I'm fine with this change, but another option would be to simply name the argument ``prefix`` (aka promote it to be part of the base API).\r\n\r\nThen we could also have a fallback, if driver doesn't

set.\r\n\r\nSince that method would perform filtering locally, it would probably also be a good idea to document that behavior (perhaps also emit a warning?) to avoid

Uploading larger file sizes will require a code change in libcloud.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\nThe Azure Storage driver's implementation of [upload_object_via_stream](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/6dca82e649456b42d23f439854d3dc807c806abf/libcloud/storage/drivers/azure_blobs.py#L822-L841) delegates to [_put_object](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/6dca82e649456b42d23f439854d3dc807c806abf/libcloud/storage/drivers/azure_blobs.py#L945-L951) which calls through to the generic [_upload_object](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/6dca82e649456b42d23f439854d3dc807c806abf/libcloud/storage/base.py#L584-L592) which does a single PUT request to the storage backend. Given that [we're using Azure Storage API version 2016-05-31](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/6dca82e649456b42d23f439854d3dc807c806abf/libcloud/storage/drivers/azure_blobs.py#L180), according to the [Put Blob documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob#remarks), the maximum file size that can be uploaded in one Put Blob request is 256 MB. As such, to support uploading files larger than 256 MB, the Azure Storage driver would have to implement chunked blob upload via [Put Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block) and [Put Block List](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list). It looks like the Azure Storage driver used to implement the chunked blob upload flow (e.g. see [24f34c9](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/24f34c99c9440523a53e940a346bced551281953/libcloud/storage/drivers/azure_blobs.py#L732-L788)). However, since [6e0040d](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/6e0040d8904cacb5dbe88309e9051be08cdc59f9) the driver doesn't have support for chunked blob upload anymore.\r\n\r\nI encountered this limitation in several other projects (e.g. https://github.com/ascoderu/opwen-cloudserver/issues/219) so I will try to find some time and work on a fix.\r\n\r\n**Work-around**\r\nIf you require access to Azure Storage via libcloud for uploading large files right now before the fix mentioned above is implemented, I would suggest to try the following: The [libcloud S3 driver currently implements chunked upload](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/6dca82e649456b42d23f439854d3dc807c806abf/libcloud/storage/drivers/s3.py#L688-L694), so you could try deploying [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) as a [gateway for Azure Storage](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-gateway-for-azure.html) and using the libcloud S3 driver to talk to the MinIO frontend which in turn communicates efficiently with the Azure Storage backend. For MinIO [947bc8c](https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/947bc8c7d3b8ad98cdbb6ce0f8dea155df16aadf) and later, this approach should work for all types of cloud-based Azure Storage accounts (e.g. Storage, StorageV2, BlobStorage) as well as Azurite and Azure IoT Edge Storage. Once chunked blob upload is fixed in libcloud, you should be able to remove the MinIO indirection and switch to libcloud's Azure Storage driver with no additional code changes required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/570704353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/570756207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1400#issuecomment-570756207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1400","id":570756207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc1NjIwNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T04:38:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T19:45:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#1400](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400?src=pr&el=desc) into [trunk](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/commit/6dca82e649456b42d23f439854d3dc807c806abf?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.08%`.\n> The diff coverage is `93.18%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=PYoduksh69&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##            trunk    #1400      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   86.58%   86.66%   +0.08%     \n==========================================\n  Files         364      364              \n  Lines       76193    76082     -111     \n  Branches     7439     7422      -17     \n==========================================\n- Hits        65968    65933      -35     \n+ Misses       7400     7325      -75     \n+ Partials     2825     2824       -1\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [libcloud/test/storage/test\\_base.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9zdG9yYWdlL3Rlc3RfYmFzZS5weQ==) | `92.92% <ø> (-0.41%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [libcloud/storage/drivers/s3.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvc3RvcmFnZS9kcml2ZXJzL3MzLnB5) | `89.3% <100%> (+0.12%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/test/storage/test\\_azure\\_blobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9zdG9yYWdlL3Rlc3RfYXp1cmVfYmxvYnMucHk=) | `94.27% <100%> (+2.27%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/test/storage/test\\_atmos.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdGVzdC9zdG9yYWdlL3Rlc3RfYXRtb3MucHk=) | `95.11% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/storage/drivers/atmos.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvc3RvcmFnZS9kcml2ZXJzL2F0bW9zLnB5) | `78.03% <100%> (+0.13%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/utils/files.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvdXRpbHMvZmlsZXMucHk=) | `100% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/storage/base.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvc3RvcmFnZS9iYXNlLnB5) | `83.01% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libcloud/storage/drivers/azure\\_blobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGliY2xvdWQvc3RvcmFnZS9kcml2ZXJzL2F6dXJlX2Jsb2JzLnB5) | `85.13% <88.46%> (+15.33%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/libcloud/pull/1400?src=pr&el=footer).
