direction. \r\n\r\nI have two questions:\r\n\r\n- As we have the same [function](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4968/files#diff-ccbf57a3feb6b78f664e3ee8dc4d86cdR307) for PUT and POST, Do we need to make this change for both methods or only for the POST APIs?\r\n\r\n- What are your views about changing the HTTP Status of DELETE API to 204 from 200?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/689083055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/689148477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4968#issuecomment-689148477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4968","id":689148477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTE0ODQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"bdoyle0182","id":11879547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODc5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11879547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182","html_url":"https://github.com/bdoyle0182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-08T21:34:57Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T21:34:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Isn't

If ContainerPool receives 2000 activations for an action that supports concurrency=200, a maximum of 10 containers (maybe less, if some were already running) should be launched. Since an activation shows up in the pool processing multiple times, each would have to be tracked as \"already affected a container launch\" to prevent a container launch on second (and subsequent) passes. If you enable concurrency in your containers, this is simpler, but has some caveats (not all runtimes/actions can support this), and is currently buffered inside the ContainerProxy instance for that container (with the waiting problem that you mention). \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/693681340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/693722522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4978#issuecomment-693722522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4978","id":693722522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MzcyMjUyMg==","user":{"login":"twavv","id":773453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzQ1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv","html_url":"https://github.com/twavv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twavv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-16T23:39:28Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T23:39:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Separately, there will probably need to be additional special handling for concurrent actions\r\n\r\nI'm thinking the best way to handle this would be a queue-per-action, and then when a new activation is received, check against the total number of containers that could handle that action.\r\n\r\nI think that still has issues around fairness though.

Is there a way to also show the discrete # (perhaps use the same internal config. value the controller uses) to be as descriptive as possible? That is fully address Dave's suggestion in the issue, i.e., \"or simply show the total allowed over all the controllers (in this case, 5 controllers (5*240=1200)\". I suspect operators would love to be reminded of the configured limits when a user presents them with this error...\r\n\r\nTeam, unfortunately this is my first time working with Scala.. I tried to follow along the code but wasn't entirely sure. Are we referring to leverage `clusterSize` property of LoadBalancer to compute and show the discrete count? I noticed another property named `totalActiveActivations`.. is this something we can use?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/699247459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/699930865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4985#issuecomment-699930865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4985","id":699930865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5OTkzMDg2NQ==","user":{"login":"style95","id":3447251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDcyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3447251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95","html_url":"https://github.com/style95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/style95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-28T10:47:20Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T10:47:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So
