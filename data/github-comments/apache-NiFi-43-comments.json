The initial stab at the PR was simply trying to address the confusing bit reported surrounding the incorrect hand pointer over the event text.\r\n\r\nWe should probably consider updating the main canvas as well to ensure its consistent throughout the application. In the context of the canvas, panning is supported by clicking and dragging on the background and moving is supported by clicking and dragging on a component. I'm thinking we should leave the arrow cursor in place on the canvas (as it's currently implemented) and introduce the move cursor when dragging (moving a component and panning only). This behavior would be similar to other tools like Google Maps.\r\n\r\nCarrying this behavior into the lineage graph, we could always have the arrow pointer (like the canvas) and clicking the background would pan and show the move cursor.

(Seriously, I am noob and am open for suggestions/advice):\r\nI am honestly not satisfied with the way I have done things. I initially continued with it as NiFi design guidelines said to have independent processor implementation, but as I proceeded I found the predefined classes are still not closed for modification and in order for things work I had to modify them, which eventually led to buggy implementation.. Do you think we should redesign whole EncryptProcessors? I was thinking having a common entry point for encryption of content as well as attributes, but this would break backward compatibility (not sure). Again it's noob's opinion, I would like to hear about your thoughts on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/274397609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/274485023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1422#issuecomment-274485023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1422","id":274485023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQ4NTAyMw==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T13:15:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T13:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfrazee should be ready to review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/274485023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/274487241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1437#issuecomment-274487241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1437","id":274487241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDQ4NzI0MQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T13:26:37Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T13:26:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @jvwing.

For GenerateTableFetch, a SQL query is made to the database to get the max values (and column types) for the table. If the table names and/or max-value columns are static (like before), the column types can be fetched when the processor is scheduled. If not, they can be determined from the SQL query results the first time it is issued (no max-values yet, e.g.).  However QueryDatabaseTable supports \"Initial Max Value\" dynamic properties, and does not perform a query ahead of time to get the max values. Instead it performs the actual fetch query, and determines the max value as it iterates over the result set.  With an initial max value, the initial query needs to have a WHERE clause, but we don't know the type of the column(s) to determine how to represent the initial max value as a literal.\r\n\r\nSo as to avoid this issue, I enabled Expression Language support for the QueryDatabaseTable properties but kept the annotation as INPUT_FORBIDDEN.  We can revisit this issue as a later improvement to QDT and/or when Initial Max Value is implemented for GenerateTableFetch (as it may have this same limitation at that point).\r\n\r\nHow does that sound?  The updated PR has the aforementioned behavior, both processors support EL (variable-based table names and max-value columns, e.g.) and GenerateTableFetch supports incoming flow files (so attributes can be used in the EL expressions).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/274592165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/274626674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1294#issuecomment-274626674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1294","id":274626674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDYyNjY3NA==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T21:43:03Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T21:43:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree it may be best to restart this effort -- I made a first pass at resolving some of the issues [here](https://github.com/alopresto/nifi/tree/NIFI-2961) but there is still work to do.

The HL7 bundle address HL7 V2 which is ascii/text protocol with XML support where as CDA is completely XML based. HL7 V3 is based on RIM model and CDA is one specific domain of V3 for clinical documents. The adoption of HL7 V3 varies as compared to legacy HL7 V2. The underlying parsers are different (HAPI and MDHT). CDA bundle is based on mapping, which will grow as more sections/entries are mapped by contributors. For now, keeping them as separate bundles makes sense, as they can be used/maintained separately without impacting each other.\r\n\r\nRegarding the XML file, this is used for unit testing only and not shipped with the bundle runtime deployment.

I reviewed it and saw the sample code using Spring JDBC template. Then I felt that this can be done outside of DBCPService. Adding getDataSource to DBCPService would be overkill.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding getDataSource method, how about adding a test method in DBCPServiceTest like below:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Test database queries using Derby through Spring JDBC template.\r\n     * Connect, create table, insert, select, drop table.\r\n     * This is more of an example to use DBCPService with Spring JDBC.\r\n     */\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testSpringJDBCTemplate() throws InitializationException, SQLException {\r\n        final TestRunner runner = TestRunners.newTestRunner(TestProcessor.class);\r\n        final DBCPConnectionPool service = new DBCPConnectionPool();\r\n        runner.addControllerService(\"test-good1\", service);\r\n\r\n        // remove previous test database, if any\r\n        final File dbLocation = new File(DB_LOCATION);\r\n        dbLocation.delete();\r\n\r\n        // set embedded Derby database connection url\r\n        runner.setProperty(service, DBCPConnectionPool.DATABASE_URL, \"jdbc:derby:\" + DB_LOCATION + \";create=true\");\r\n        runner.setProperty(service, DBCPConnectionPool.DB_USER, \"tester\");\r\n        runner.setProperty(service, DBCPConnectionPool.DB_PASSWORD, \"testerp\");\r\n        runner.setProperty(service, DBCPConnectionPool.DB_DRIVERNAME, \"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver\");\r\n\r\n        runner.enableControllerService(service);\r\n\r\n        runner.assertValid(service);\r\n        final DBCPService dbcpService = (DBCPService) runner.getProcessContext().getControllerServiceLookup().getControllerService(\"test-good1\");\r\n        Assert.assertNotNull(dbcpService);\r\n\r\n        // Create a jdbcTemplate. Wrap dbcpService so that it can act as a DataSource.\r\n        JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(new BasicDataSource() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {\r\n                return dbcpService.getConnection();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public Connection getConnection(String user, String pass) throws SQLException {\r\n                throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"User and password can not be overwritten.\");\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            jdbcTemplate.execute(dropTable);\r\n        } catch (final Exception e) {\r\n            // table may not exist, this is not serious problem.\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        jdbcTemplate.execute(createTable);\r\n\r\n        jdbcTemplate.update(\"insert into restaurants values (1, 'Irifunes', 'San Mateo')\");\r\n        jdbcTemplate.update(\"insert into restaurants values (2, 'Estradas', 'Daly City')\");\r\n        jdbcTemplate.update(\"insert into restaurants values (3, 'Prime Rib House', 'San Francisco')\");\r\n\r\n        int nrOfRows = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(\"select count(*) from restaurants\", Integer.class);\r\n        assertEquals(3, nrOfRows);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, we can let other developers know that there're users using DBCPService in their custom processors integrated with Spring JDBC framework. Also if DBCPService changes its signature or behavior in the future, we can detect that breaking change by this test.\r\n\r\nHow do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/276555620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/276586297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1302#issuecomment-276586297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1302","id":276586297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjU4NjI5Nw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T06:55:13Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T06:55:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @skrewz just checking in to see if you need any assistance or if it's just been a matter of bandwidth on this.
