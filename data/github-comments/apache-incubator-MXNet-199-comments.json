And if I run it again, this speed value may recover to a normal level.\r\n\r\nIn a word, it seems that my gpu does not works as stable as it should be.

a separate function to save isn't a solution to this issue for two reasons that I can think of:\r\n\r\n1. you can't embed the model in some other data structure (such as a list or tibble) and save that data structure\r\n1. having a separate `save` function treats these objects differently than any other. If every model did this, R's api would be horrendous; nobody wants to remember a different save command.  \r\n\r\nFor case #1, it would preclude someone from doing any ensembling of models (like Bayesian model averaging or bagging) as well as having a [`caret`](https://github.com/topepo/caret/blob/master/models/files/mxnet.R) module.
