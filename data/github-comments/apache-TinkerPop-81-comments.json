compression which wasn't present in .NET Standard, but was only added in .NET 6.\r\nUsers on .NET 7 or 8 can of course still use Gremlin.Net. They should get the version built for .NET 6 in that case.\r\n\r\nWe could of course add another target for .NET 7 and/or .NET 8, but I think that doesn't add any benefit if we're not using any APIs specific for these versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1938856875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1939207359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2468#issuecomment-1939207359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2468","id":1939207359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5zlfS_","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-12T17:32:37Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T17:32:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In general I like the idea of testing both .NET 6 and .NET 8 in GHA similar to how Java is currently setup (I don't see a need for contributors to run both locally).

I would also like to just execute the tests in GHA for .NET 6 and 8 without requiring contributors to have both installed, but I can't find a solution for this which doesn't require ugly workarounds.\r\nWe can't just configure this for GHA unfortunately. Instead, we need to add both versions as `TargetFrameworks` to the `csproj` config files of the test projects like this to let the tests run on both versions:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<TargetFrameworks>net6.0;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if we do that, then you also need to have both installed in order to execute the tests. If you only have .NET 8 installed, then you'll get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTesthost process for source(s) '[...]/tinkerpop/gremlin-dotnet/test/Gremlin.Net.UnitTest/bin/Debug/net6.0/Gremlin.Net.UnitTest.dll' exited with error: You must install or update .NET to run this application.\r\nApp: [...]/tinkerpop/gremlin-dotnet/test/Gremlin.Net.UnitTest/bin/Debug/net6.0/testhost.dll\r\nArchitecture: x64\r\nFramework: 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '6.0.0' (x64)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, if we want to execute the tests for both versions in GHA, then we also need to test them like this locally which means that all contributors need to have both versions installed.\r\n\r\nBut since you already cast

are targetting this PR against the master branch which is currently for the next major release (4.0). The way our branching system works is that you target the lowest version that you want the change to go into. Then when your PR gets merged, the committer will merge your changes all the way up to the latest master branch. It's a bit difficult to explain so I'll use an example. If you want your changes to go into the next 3.6.x, 3.7.x and 4.x release, then you would target the 3.6-dev branch and it will get merged up for you. If you target master then it will only go into the next 4.x release.\r\n\r\nI say this because I believe that currently there is no timeline for releasing 4.0 as we are doing releases for 3.6.x and 3.7.x. So if you were to target master then you may need to wait for a while for this change to get released. However, because its currently targetting an unreleased branch, you are technically allowed to upgrade the Node version and ES version.\r\n\r\nSo, do you prefer to wait for this change to arrive in 4.x? In which case, you can make Node and ES version changes. Or, if you want it released sooner then you will probably have to undo your changes to ESLint and target the 3.7-dev branch as some of those changes could be considered breaking.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1972243401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1972252523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2506#issuecomment-1972252523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2506","id":1972252523,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc51ji9r","user":{"login":"tien","id":19813755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODEzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19813755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien","html_url":"https://github.com/tien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-01T01:00:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-01T01:43:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kenhuuu Node 18 is compatible with all ES2022 features, so the changes to ESLint should be good.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Node version, I'm okay with keeping it 18 now.

How would you feel about changing the wording in the readme to something such as `Gremlin-Javascript implements Gremlin within the JavaScript language and can be used on Node.js and has experimental support for Web APIs compatible runtimes`. I would be more comfortable listing it as full support after it has gone through a few release cycles and we have more confidence that browser compatibility is stable and we aren't likely to accidentally break it with the absence of tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1979922134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1979939474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2506#issuecomment-1979939474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2506","id":1979939474,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc52A3qS","user":{"login":"tien","id":19813755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODEzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19813755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien","html_url":"https://github.com/tien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-06T01:57:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T01:57:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Cole-Greer Yeah I think that make sense, have changed the README accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1979939474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1981258323","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2506#issuecomment-1981258323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2506","id":1981258323,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc52F5pT","user":{"login":"Cole-Greer","id":112986082,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrwH4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112986082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer","html_url":"https://github.com/Cole-Greer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cole-Greer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-06T16:23:40Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T16:23:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tien, I think this is great.
