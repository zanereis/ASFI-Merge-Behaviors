There's [GitHub Actions Runner VMs specs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/specifications-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) for more details about the environment. It's possible to debug such an environment by getting a shell inside a running VM with https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-tmate in your own fork, for example. To debug the GitHub Actions VM, you'd enable GitHub Actions in your own fork in some repository and open a PR to your own fork. However the downside of that is that it's very time consuming.

One detail that immediately caught my eye in `LinuxBrokerHostUsageImpl` is the usage of `System.currentTimeMillis()`. Replacing that with `System.nanoTime()` could be helpful.

So user dont have to worry wether the producer is closed or non-existed. but in this pr, for some reason, i assume that user will get a closed producer from cache, and when user try to send message from a closed or non-existed producer, which might have some additional issue, like function been blocked with closed producer.

One detail that immediately caught my eye in LinuxBrokerHostUsageImpl is the usage of System.currentTimeMillis(). Replacing that with System.nanoTime() could be helpful. The calculations that mix doubles and longs seem error prone.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the class and the scheduling of the `calculateBrokerHostUsage` method, I can see that this class (and `GenericBrokerHostUsageImpl `) are not really designed to be called in immediate succession. (Side note, that makes me wonder about the choice to use `scheduleAtFixedRate` instead of `scheduleWithFixedDelay`.) Because we don't intend to call the methods in immediate succession, millis look like they could be fine, but I could definitely see making a switch to nanos too. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI also agree that the mix of longs and doubles seems error prone.\r\n\r\n> It would be useful to check how good the test coverage for this class is.\r\n\r\nThese classes do seem pretty fundamental to load balancing and I believe they are also essential to the load shedding mechanisms, which are pretty important. There are tests that implicitly cover this code, but perhaps we can add something more explicit in another PR. It's likely that these tests aren't covered because some of the logic is hard to test. Reworking some of the classes to make them more testable might be necessary.\r\n\r\n> The code in LinuxBrokerHostUsageImpl rings some bells. I faced some issues earlier where the method to read the Linux /proc and /sys/fs files with Files.readAllBytes was causing odd issues. I'll have to check if I reported an issue back then or brought it up on Pulsar Slack etc.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you found anything regarding this issue. My most recent commit should definitely add some stability to the `LinuxBrokerHostUsageImpl` by not calling it at nearly the same time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/775720402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/775735510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9393#issuecomment-775735510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9393","id":775735510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTczNTUxMA==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T07:34:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T07:35:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Let me know if you found anything regarding this issue.

Good catch. It's the `calculateBrokerHostUsage` call that is scheduled and the `calculateBrokerHostUsage` call in the constructor that cause the issue. \r\n\r\nBesides the race, it also seems that this is a clear bug in the `calculateBrokerHostUsage` method itself.

Here's the Java client code for tests:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\nclass Apex {\r\n    private Map<String, List<String>> values;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class SchemaDemo {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        try (PulsarClient pulsarClient = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(\"pulsar://localhost:6650\").build()) {\r\n            Producer<Apex> producer = pulsarClient\r\n                    .newProducer(Schema.AVRO(Apex.class))\r\n                    .topic(\"example\")\r\n                    .create();\r\n            producer.close();\r\n        } catch (PulsarClientException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it works well.\r\n\r\nCompare these two schema string (they are both formatted).\r\n\r\n1. Java\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"record\",\r\n  \"name\": \"Apex\",\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"values\",\r\n      \"type\": [\r\n        \"null\",\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"map\",\r\n          \"values\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"array\",\r\n            \"items\": \"string\",\r\n            \"java-class\": \"java.util.List\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"default\": null\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Python\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"Apex\",\r\n  \"type\": \"record\",\r\n  \"fields\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"values\",\r\n      \"type\": [\r\n        \"null\",\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"map\",\r\n          \"values\": \"array\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key difference is the type of array item, in Python it's just\r\n\r\n```json\r\n          \"values\": \"array\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in Java it's\r\n\r\n```json\r\n          \"values\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"array\",\r\n            \"items\": \"string\",\r\n            \"java-class\": \"java.util.List\"\r\n          }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/776086957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/776094164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9546#issuecomment-776094164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9546","id":776094164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjA5NDE2NA==","user":{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T17:09:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T17:09:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot
