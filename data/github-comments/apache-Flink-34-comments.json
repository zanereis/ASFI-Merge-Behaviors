This is not right, but it's not a problem. We can easily fix it. :-) I suggest that you do the following:\n1. If you don't have the Flink repository as a remote, add it: `git add remote flink https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/flink.git` and do a fetch `git fetch flink`. This depends on whether you cloned your fork or the main repo.\n2. Checkout a new branch from flink/master: `git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH flink/master`.\n3. Cherry pick your commit: `git cherry-pick 3f07464`. This will add your commit to the new branch. There should be no conflicts.\n4. Now force push this to the branch of _this_ pull request: `git push -f origin YOUR_BRANCH:checks_for_import`. Assuming that origin is your forked repository. You have to force push, because you are changing the history of this branch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/108791701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/108795427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/774#issuecomment-108795427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/774","id":108795427,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODc5NTQyNw==","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-04T09:06:28Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T09:06:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks so much for updating the docs and starting the discussion on the ML.
