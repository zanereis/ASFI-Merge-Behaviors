Add the official Apache repo as a remote in your local clone (one time step):\n   `git remote add apache https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-metron.git`\n2. checkout whatever branch you want to merge it into:\n   `git checkout master`\n3. Merge the pull request:\n   `git pull git@github.com:charlesporter/incubator-metron.git master`\n4. Push the results to the Apache repo:\n   `git push apache master`\n\nA git hook will automatically close the github pull request when the repos get synced.\n\nIf there is a pull request that you want to close without merging, you can simply ask the person who opened it to close it. If that doesn't work, you can use a commit message to close it.\n\nTo do that, make a trivial change, like adding a space to README.md, and commit and push the change. In the commit message add the text \"this closes #N\" where N is the number of the pull request. When the repos sync, the pull request will get closed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/165505353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/165519159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1#issuecomment-165519159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1","id":165519159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTUxOTE1OQ==","user":{"login":"ddutta","id":877050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NzA1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/877050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta","html_url":"https://github.com/ddutta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddutta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T17:18:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T17:18:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see it when I apply the patch but can't figure out why my commits are not getting applied to the patch of the pull request. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/165519159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/165521885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1#issuecomment-165521885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1","id":165521885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTUyMTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"omalley","id":206536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjUzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley","html_url":"https://github.com/omalley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omalley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T17:29:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T17:29:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cestella the asf-site branch is the output of jekyll.

(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html).\n\nEdit: OpenJDK7 support has been taken over by Red Hat so that's still available though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/172650089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/172932282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/9#issuecomment-172932282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/9","id":172932282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjkzMjI4Mg==","user":{"login":"ehashman","id":4706131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDYxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4706131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman","html_url":"https://github.com/ehashman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehashman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T17:51:47Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T17:51:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reaperhulk:
