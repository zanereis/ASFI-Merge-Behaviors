That would be a bigger immediate concern regarding this change.\"\r\n\r\nYes. That is why so many questions above. We create a pio driver machine that runs training and is then taken down. This is in sync with bringing up Spark and taking it down. The pio driver machine is really part of the Spark cluster and for the UR (and other PIO templates we have) the predict part runs without Spark. So this requires we use some engine instance id across machines to find data in the metastore. We also have deployments with 2 EventServers and 2 PredictionServers behind a load balancer. This requires that the same metadata is available to several different machines running, what I've come to see as 3 independent processes, ES, PS, train. They are independent except for the metadata.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/264552919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/264927633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/328#issuecomment-264927633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/328","id":264927633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDkyNzYzMw==","user":{"login":"dszeto","id":1388362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODgzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto","html_url":"https://github.com/dszeto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-05T18:01:16Z","updated_at":"2016-12-05T18:01:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chanlee514 @pferrel I have moved the discussion to dev@.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/264927633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/265403429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/195#issuecomment-265403429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/195","id":265403429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTQwMzQyOQ==","user":{"login":"voran","id":3538117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzgxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3538117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran","html_url":"https://github.com/voran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-07T09:51:52Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T09:51:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Any chance this will get merged soon?

dataset-id  (app)\r\n - a model-id, which points to metadata used to create a model from a dataset\r\n - the metadata would contain the specific engine.json data used and the dataset-id (actually the appName in the engine but we need to remove this too) so it would connect the model-id to the dataset-id with all data needed to create the model from the dataset.\r\n\r\nIn all commands (but one) this would allow the metadata to be retrieved from the metastore.\r\n\r\nWe can then re-do the CLI to be completely stateless, and not require anything be copied between machines except a common

IMO ES 1.x should be the default build requiring no config change anywhere. We should somehow mark ES 1.x as \"being deprecated\" for a release or 2 and support 5.x with new config. Over time ES 5.x becomes the default and es 1.x becomes truly removed to keep old cruft to a minimum.\r\n2) The effect on Templates. This seems problematic since few of the Templates are actually part of what the PIO team maintains. Personally I'm for making some fairly radical changes but they should be done IMO all at once in a primary version change like 0.x to 1.x. Until then we risk most of the Templates becoming dead-end zombies. Too many haven't even been moved to the new namespace.\r\n\r\nI agree that in all likelihood only the UR will need a code change to support 5.x and am willing to commit to that as long as the other Templates remain untouched--ideally.\r\n\r\nMy $0.02 worth ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/274283200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/274878286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/299#issuecomment-274878286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/299","id":274878286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDg3ODI4Ng==","user":{"login":"dszeto","id":1388362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODgzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto","html_url":"https://github.com/dszeto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T17:39:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T17:39:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @haricharan123 !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/274878286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/274896387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/336#issuecomment-274896387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/336","id":274896387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDg5NjM4Nw==","user":{"login":"dszeto","id":1388362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODgzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto","html_url":"https://github.com/dszeto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dszeto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T18:43:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T18:43:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to do some more manual testing.

The reasoning is that ES refactored es-hadoop-mr and es-spark at some time between the 2 so if you pull them into a Template (the UR does this) you get duplicate classes. It is not clear yet how to solve this but it is highly unlikely that if we had 2 PIO build profiles, one for ES1 and one for ES5 as well as 2 for any template using the ES Spark integration, this would go away and would be cleaner.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to do this is that the pio-env.sh would be simplified to only configure ELASTICSEARCH, not different named stores. \r\n\r\nMost of this is fine and though it would require a non-trivial change to the UR, I think this is doable and would commit to supporting it if the above issues can be solved. So to summarize I suggest we:\r\n\r\n1) create the equivalent of a Maven build profile for ES5 and leave the default ES1 for now with a warning that ES5 will be the default in some future release.\r\n2) leave pio-env.sh with only the ES config for whatever version is installed with the name ELASTICSEARCH. If the scheme needs to be there for both that's ok with me.\r\n\r\nThis will make any Template that uses ES directly just work with ES1 and the default build and it will leave the Template work to move to ES5 using the new build profile for PIO with ES5.\r\n\r\nIf this pushes the ES5 build profile to 0.12.0, I personally am ok with that. I it delay 0.11.0 I'm also ok with that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/281479575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/comments/281480000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/336#issuecomment-281480000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/predictionio/issues/336","id":281480000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTQ4MDAwMA==","user":{"login":"pferrel","id":326731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjczMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel","html_url":"https://github.com/pferrel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pferrel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T21:05:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T21:10:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dszeto I gave you a link to my merged version, to modify this PR I'd need permission to collaborate on the branch from the PR author, or I can create a new PR, which do you want?\r\n\r\n@marevol are you ok with the suggestions above?

I mean we cannot choose which Scala version to use. If we choose 1.6, Scala version is determined 2.10 because Spark 1.x is built with Scala 2.10 by default, otherwise 2.11.\r\n\r\nBut #295 comment says that we can configure the following:\r\n```\r\n-Dbuild.profile=scala-2.11 -Dspark.version=1.6.0\r\n```\r\nIf we configure this, we should download the Spark source package and build with Scala 2.11 support(http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.6.3/building-spark.html#building-for-scala-211).
