There can be multiple _final_ tasks that process input independently, whose finishing point are known only to each task. Thus, we still need to collect those _final_ task ids to check TaskGroup completion.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/373625012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/373991169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/pull/2#issuecomment-373991169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/2","id":373991169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzk5MTE2OQ==","user":{"login":"johnyangk","id":4114572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTQ1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4114572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk","html_url":"https://github.com/johnyangk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-18T11:35:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T11:35:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @sanha.

While separating the `testplans` package into two as per your suggestion, I've come to realize that the `BasicPushPolicy` and the `BasicPullPolicy` really should go into the `optimizer` package. So I moved those classes to the `optimizer` package.\r\n\r\nI've also renamed `testplans` to `plangenerator`, and refactored `TestPlanGenerator` to make its public methods only deal with physical plans, and hide IRs and policies from the tests in the other `runtime` package. \r\n\r\nAt present `TestPlanGenerator` can generate three specific types of plans used in the current scheduler tests, but we can later extend this class to generate many random, complex DAGs to be used by not only the scheduler test but also the test for the executors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/390116743/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/comments/390528099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/pull/20#issuecomment-390528099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/20","id":390528099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDUyODA5OQ==","user":{"login":"johnyangk","id":4114572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTQ1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4114572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk","html_url":"https://github.com/johnyangk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnyangk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-21T01:10:10Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T01:10:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jeongyooneo
