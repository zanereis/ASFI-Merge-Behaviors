thank you for the nice work.\nIn addition to the above my comments, I have more comments to discuss with you.\n- Duplicate exception VS Ambiguous exception\n  - It seems that every exception is the duplicate exception when there already exists the same thing. However, IMHO, it would be better if we support ambiguous exception as well depending on the situation. For example, the duplicate exception is appropriate for creating a table while the ambiguous exception is appropriate for getting or dropping a table.\n- CatalogExceptionUtil and ExceptionUtil\n  - These classes look good, but only some methods are used in your implementation. Do you have any reason?\n- In your implementation, `INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE` is threw if uses try to remove the default database. I think that it would be much proper to use this error code for the real privilege violation after we support the privilege feature. I've also tested that pgsql allows for users to remove the default database if they have sufficient privilege. I wonder why you chose this implementation.\n\nAdditionally, please add a description of `TajoInternalError` on our wiki.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122618809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122619034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/608#issuecomment-122619034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/608","id":122619034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjYxOTAzNA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-19T03:26:53Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T03:26:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The latest patch looks good to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122619034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122641665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/634#issuecomment-122641665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/634","id":122641665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjY0MTY2NQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-19T09:21:51Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T09:49:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've tested this patch on my laptop using YourKit.\nHere are some highlights of the results.\n\n### Query and data\n\nI used the following query on TPC-H data set with the scale factor of 1.\n\n```\ndefault> select count(distinct l_partkey) from lineitem;\n```\n\n### 1. Tuple creation\n\nIn this section, I'll share two interesting results, that is the result of middle in the query and the result after query completion.\n\n#### Result of middle in the query\n\nThe following numbers were randomly captured during executing the second phase of distinct aggregation. So, it would not be the exact comparison, but is valuable I think.\n\n##### Master\n\n| Class | Objects | Shallow Size | Retained Size |\n| --- | :-: | --: | --: |\n| org.apache.tajo.datum.Datum[] | 3,899,275 | 87,335,008 | 96,857,392 |\n| org.apache.tajo.storage.VTuple | 3,899,275 | 93,582,600 | 112,627,520 |\n\n##### Tajo-1343\n\n| Class | Objects | Shallow Size | Retained Size |\n| --- | :-: | --: | --: |\n| org.apache.tajo.datum.Datum[] | 2,971,439 | 71,314,440 | 78,096,672 |\n| org.apache.tajo.engine.planner.physical.KeyTuple | 2,573,412 | 82,349,184 | 95,913,472 |\n| org.apache.tajo.storage.VTuple | 398,023 | 9,552,552 | 9,552,984 |\n\nThe total size of generated tuples in TAJO-1343 is less than that in master, but this might be not fare because the created number of datum arrays is different. (The difference in # of tuples is 7,161,064, and # of datum arrays is 18,760,720.)\n\n#### Result after query completion\n\nThe following numbers were randomly captured after query completion.\n\n##### Master\n\n| Class | Objects | Shallow Size | Retained Size |\n| --- | :-: | --: | --: |\n| org.apache.tajo.datum.Datum[] | 8,811,947 | 208,457,752 | 208,457,752 |\n| org.apache.tajo.storage.VTuple | 8,811,943 | 211,486,632 | 211,486,632 |\n\n##### Tajo-1343\n\n| Class | Objects | Shallow Size | Retained Size |\n| --- | :-: | --: | --: |\n| org.apache.tajo.datum.Datum[] | 3,646,956 | 87,526,872 | 87,526,872 |\n| org.apache.tajo.engine.planner.physical.KeyTuple | 1,667,560 | 53,361,920 | 53,361,920 |\n| org.apache.tajo.storage.VTuple | 1,979,389 | 47,505,336 | 47,505,336 |\n\nAs you can see, the number of remaining datum arrays and tuples with TAJO-1343 is much less than that of master.\n\n### 2. Memory usage\n\nThe following graphs show the changes of memory usage during query execution.\n\n##### < Memory usage of with master >\n\n![memory usage of with master](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12745995/master-memory.png)\n\n##### < Memory usage of with TAJO-1343 >\n\n![memory usage of with TAJO-1343](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12745994/1343-memory.png)\n\nThe gray part in each graph represents the change of memory usage during query execution.\nAs can be seen in the graphs, memory usage change with TAJO-1343 is more gracefully than that with master.\n\nThe following numbers were captured when the query is finished because it's the time when the numbers become the maximum. \n\n| branch name | Allocated all pools | Used PS Eden Space | Used PS Survivor Space | Used PS Old Gen | # of GCs |\n| --- | --- | :-: | --: | --: | --: |\n| master | 1006 | 634 | 22 | 63 | 4 |\n| TAJO-1343 | 1002 | 518 | 43 | 71 | 3 |\n\nThe amount of `allocated all pools` with TAJO-1343 is similar to that of master. However, `used PS eden space` with TAJO-1343 is about 100 MB less than that with master. This means that the less objects are newly created during query execution. \n\nIn this test, the numbers of GCs with both branches are similar, so it is of less significance. However, I think that the difference in number of GCs will be increased with more complex queries, thereby more significantly affecting to the query performance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122641665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122716608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/593#issuecomment-122716608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/593","id":122716608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjcxNjYwOA==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-19T23:17:35Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T23:17:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 The latest patch looks good to me. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122716608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/122719079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/621#issuecomment-122719079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/621","id":122719079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjcxOTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-19T23:56:05Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T23:59:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for your comments.\n\nDuplicate and ambiguous are clearly distinguished. Duplicate error will occur in only add or creation command. For example, ALTER ADD, CREATE TABLE, CREATE DATABASE will incur duplicate name. Ambiguous occurs in getter method like `SELECT FROM...` and getFunction(). So, there are only three cases (table, column, and function) for ambiguous errors. Especially, JDBC specification distinguish both kinds of errors. So, we need them all too.\n\nAll methods in ExceptionUtil seems to be used. CatalogExceptionUtil includes four unused methods.\nI'll remove them.\n\nCurrently, Tajo is assumed to have only one current database through planning and `default` database is the easy device to guarantee the assumption. So, we should prohibit the removal of `DEFAULT` database. To handle them, in the current implementation, I regard default database and information schema database as read-only things. So, the attempt to remove `DEFAULT` or `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` cause `INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE`. In addition, It can be easily matched with JDBC errors.
