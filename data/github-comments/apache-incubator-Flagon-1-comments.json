This is definitely an issue in our post-TLP steps that we absolutely need to address. \r\n\r\nHow the site works--see here: https://github.com/apache/flagon/tree/asf-site/site\r\n\r\nBLUF--update source at MASTER, rebuild and copy files to /contents, then merge to ASF-SITE branch. Automation for publication is managed through the asf.yaml files in asf-site branch.\r\n\r\nThe site could use a major overhaul in the build (its so old). We can limp by updating files. I can try and help this weekend in updating the .md files which build into html. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flagon/issues/comments/1530739189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flagon/issues/comments/1532173974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flagon/pull/26#issuecomment-1532173974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flagon/issues/26","id":1532173974,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBLE1P85bUx6W","user":{"login":"brucearctor","id":5032356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzIzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5032356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor","html_url":"https://github.com/brucearctor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucearctor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-02T21:25:02Z","updated_at":"2023-05-02T21:25:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let's bump things","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flagon/issues/comments/1532173974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flagon/issues/comments/1577886073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flagon/pull/29#issuecomment-1577886073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flagon/issues/29","id":1577886073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBLE1P85eDKF5","user":{"login":"poorejc","id":12189190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg5MTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12189190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc","html_url":"https://github.com/poorejc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poorejc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-06T04:28:34Z","updated_at":"2023-06-06T04:28:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@brucearctor Thanks so much for this!
