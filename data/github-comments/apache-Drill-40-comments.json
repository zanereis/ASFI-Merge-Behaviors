In the Apache, any contributor can provide a solution that (s)he considers to be the best solution possible and then it can either be accepted by the community/contributor or blocked with -1 (requires technical justification). If another contributor provides an alternative solution, a community may decide to go with the alternate solution as long as it addresses technical concerns of the initial contribution. For this particular case, my requirements are a) a unified approach (@parthchandra has the same requirement) and b) the ability to cancel tasks asynchronously. If that can be done with the approach outlined in PR #1257 and a contributor will change it to address all the issues, let's move forward with the alternate approach.\r\n\r\nA note regarding the complexity of the implementation. This implementation uses public java concurrency classes as well. It does not rely on unsupported or unsafe to use Java classes and/or API. Basically, `LockSupport` is the same first-class concurrency construct as `Thread` or `CountDownLatch` classes. The primary use case for using those constructs is to create a combination of `ExecutorService` and a `CountDownLatch` that is not provided by the Java itself.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I am perfectly fine to go with an alternate solution or with another committer to review the PR, it will be against Apache way to force a committer to review or commit a change, that (s)he is not comfortable with.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/401862300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/401925379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1336#issuecomment-401925379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1336","id":401925379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTkyNTM3OQ==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-02T20:32:00Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T20:32:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva

Chun was unable to reproduce the issue, however after staring at the code for several days, I think I see the source of the issue. I believe the issue mostly stems from two bugs in the FileSystem.get method provided to us by hadoop.\r\n\r\n  1. **Bug # 1** is that FileSystem.get does not actually take into account the Configuration object you give it. This means that if you ask for two different FileSystem system objects with different configurations for dfs, FileSystem.get assumes both are the same and the first dfs FileSystem and config requested wins and is the one that is always returned. That's pretty crazy to me, but you can check the equals method for **FileSystem.Cache.Key** yourself.\r\n 2. **Bug # 2** The **fs.default.name** property is not honored when doing FileSystem.get, only **fs.defaultFS** is honored. You can see this by tracing through the code:\r\n    1. FileSystem.get(Configuration conf) calls FileSystem.getDefaultUri(Configuration conf) \r\n    2. FileSystem.getDefaultUri(Configuration conf) looks up FileSystem.FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY in the Configuration\r\n    3. FileSystem.FS_DEFAULT_NAME_KEY is **fs.defaultFS**.\r\n    4. If **fs.defaultFS** is not defined then the uri for caching purposes is assumed to be **file://**\r\n\r\nThese bugs would basically completely break things if hive plugin and the filesystem plugin were storing files in different places. I suspect we aren't seeing any issues because most people only have one dfs cluster to store their data for both hive and other applications.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n * Bypass the caching in FileSystem.get and do our own caching in DrillFileSystem, which takes into account Configuration objects.\r\n * Set **fs.defaultFS**  as well as **fs.default.name** in our configuration objects.\r\n * Make DrillFileSystem immutable and make things cleaner and more explicit in general.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/402292010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/402292968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1296#issuecomment-402292968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1296","id":402292968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjI5Mjk2OA==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-03T21:10:56Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T21:10:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also forgot to mention a third possible bug, which is that FileSystemConfigurations defined in the HiveStoragePlugin are passed to DrillFileSystem in HiveDrillNativeParquetRowGroupScan.getFsConf().

run tests before making PR and after each round of changes after code review. Your tests in Slow category so Travis did not run them. Since it's UDFs that you are adding, you need build project first and them run your unit tests (since they are cached) or run all tests during build which I suspect was not done. I had to redo batch commits because of this failure :( Now you commit is excluded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/402465726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/402528428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1272#issuecomment-402528428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1272","id":402528428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjUyODQyOA==","user":{"login":"abhidotravi","id":9062901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjI5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9062901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi","html_url":"https://github.com/abhidotravi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhidotravi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-04T17:08:51Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T17:08:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva - Done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/402528428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/402660764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1126#issuecomment-402660764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1126","id":402660764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjY2MDc2NA==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-05T09:21:11Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T09:21:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers could you please do final code review?
