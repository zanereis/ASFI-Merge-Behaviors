- some comments\n- IMHO - Use cobra as much as possible for argument processing.  Piggybacking moving the httpClient initialization away from init time... the httpClient initialization can be contained in a single `Pre*Run` cobra command function.  See https://github.com/spf13/cobra#prerun-or-postrun-hooks.  This way, commands not needing httpClient support would not have the overhead of initializing a httpClient.\n- I recommend that parseArgs() focus solely on parsing arguments and that the setup() (was init()) function should be called outside of parseArgs()\n- Remove the `\\n` character from the errMsg strings - the string used to create the error objects.

3 would be to have \"nodejs\" continue to always mean \"Node 0.12\" both in the CLI and in the OW backend.

Instead of an alias, the default Node runtime could be selected by not explicitly specifying a `kind` for .js actions.

Now we are trying to install everything when we install openwhisk, which I think there is a potential to improve.\n\nInstallation of OpenWhisk can be abstracted into a general project or somewhere we feel comfortable (like the role of devstack plays in openstack). It may install the openwhisk core(we can define late what it means), it may install the catalogs, it may install third party action... The role is to be responsible for deployment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/228107982/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/228113277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/745#issuecomment-228113277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/745","id":228113277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODExMzI3Nw==","user":{"login":"sjfink","id":1533170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink","html_url":"https://github.com/sjfink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjfink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T16:55:18Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T16:55:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rabbah the fact that I must re-run prereq.xml when my docker-machine is restarted should be documented with the docker-machine instructions, I think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/228113277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/228114505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/745#issuecomment-228114505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/745","id":228114505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODExNDUwNQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T16:59:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T17:00:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is - https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/tree/master/ansible#install-prerequisites\n\n> Caveat: Mac users who have a docker-machine setup will have to re-run this playbook every time the boot2docker machine is rebooted.
