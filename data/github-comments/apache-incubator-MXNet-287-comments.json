we can do is:\r\n- Add imperative support for `nd.where`. symbolic execution is not supported. To do so, we just need to rename the backend operator and add wrappers in the ndarray/symbol frontend, where `ndarray.where` supports `x=None` and `y=None`. It's hard to support symbolic execution since we have to block and wait on the completion of such operation, which makes shape inference of the rest of the operators in the graph very hard. \r\n- Internally, the `_where(cond)` operator will register `FComputeEx`, and output `csr` output. The size of the output is `[num_dims, N]`, where `N` is the number of total elements in `cond`, `num_dims` is the number of dimension of `cond`. At runtime, the operator will generate data based on `n`, the number of true elements in `cond`. To know how many true elements are there, we just need to access `output.data`. The size of `output.data` is `(num_dim x n)`. \r\n- Interface-wise, we should not return the csr output to user directly. Instead, the wrapper first call `_where(cond)` to get the csr output, and access `output.data` to get the indices. In order to make it easier for users to access these elements using advanced indexing, we can take slice the data to generate a list of `num_dim` 1-D ndarrays, where each one is of dimension `n`. \r\n\r\n\\* currently advanced indexing only takes tuple of ndarrays as input indices. @reminisce it will be good to confirm if we can turn on the support of ndarray list easily (if there's no ambiguity). \r\n\\* this is more like an ad-hot solution for `where`. If there are more general use cases like this, we should bring them up and discuss a general solution (like the dynamic shape in tf). If we want to go for a temporary solution that works and add dynamic shape later, we should make sure the interface is consistent from the user's perspective. \r\n\r\n@szha @piiswrong @ZiyueHuang ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/353659575/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/353665421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/9180#issuecomment-353665421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9180","id":353665421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzY2NTQyMQ==","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T19:57:05Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T19:57:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you provide an example that reproduces the bug?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/353665421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/353666238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/8822#issuecomment-353666238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8822","id":353666238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzY2NjIzOA==","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T20:02:27Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T20:02:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We can enable advanced indexing to support index as a list of numpy.ndarrays or mx.ndarray.NDArrays.
