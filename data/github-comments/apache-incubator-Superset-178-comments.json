I did some testing on what the upper limit should be for different viz types, I think the only one we should increase is the line chart, I set it to 50000. This is still pretty slow but usable. The bar chart and area chart get pretty slow at 10K, they could be a little larger but this seems fine. The compare chart doesn't have a way of hiding the legend so there's no chance anyone is using it even at 10K currently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/434886968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/434887495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6254#issuecomment-434887495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6254","id":434887495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDg4NzQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-01T00:00:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T00:00:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6254](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/7b3095d6ff0e0d40c52cb5f77937f5aae10da756?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.1%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #6254      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage   77.08%   76.98%   -0.11%     \n==========================================\n  Files          64       64              \n  Lines        9498     9498              \n==========================================\n- Hits         7322     7312      -10     \n- Misses       2176     2186      +10\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [superset/forms.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZm9ybXMucHk=) | `91.8% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [superset/db\\_engine\\_specs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvZGJfZW5naW5lX3NwZWNzLnB5) | `54.16% <0%> (-0.88%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [superset/connectors/sqla/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-c3VwZXJzZXQvY29ubmVjdG9ycy9zcWxhL21vZGVscy5weQ==) | `79.81% <0%> (-0.75%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6254?src=pr&el=footer).

does not work for me (nginx version: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu) and superset 0.28.1 on different servers). We wanted to evaluate Superset, but I think about to give it up.\r\n\r\nMy trys ended up in cascades of https://host.xyz/superset/superset/superset/[...]/welcome, in lots of 404s, never-ending redirects or something similar.\r\n\r\nI even configured nginx to listen to 8443 (since 443 is bounded to a bunch of other applications) to pass everything to the superset server. But even this ended up in an error: \"The referrer does not match the host.\"\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I came in touch with several (>50) semi professional and professional web applications as an administrator of reverse proxies and web application firewalls. Even the worse ones were able to define a url prefix or were able to work behind a reverse proxy without breaking the fingers. This is a must have for web applications nowadays. (To be fair, it seems to be more a flask issue than a Superset issue, maybe flask is not the right choice.)\r\n\r\nI like the idea of hiding applications behind url prefixes for public access-able services, because the most scanners try to tackle / and a bunch of well-know directories and nothing more. In addition to that it is much, much easier for http based routing, if you have one central entry point.\r\n\r\nAny hint to solve it is appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/435204864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/435244509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6258#issuecomment-435244509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6258","id":435244509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTI0NDUwOQ==","user":{"login":"kk580kk","id":1821466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjE0NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1821466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk","html_url":"https://github.com/kk580kk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kk580kk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-02T01:45:16Z","updated_at":"2018-11-02T01:45:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n@mistercrunch  I see , i will add comment above the line","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/435244509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/435261003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6215#issuecomment-435261003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6215","id":435261003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTI2MTAwMw==","user":{"login":"wenxuanguan","id":7418459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTg0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan","html_url":"https://github.com/wenxuanguan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenxuanguan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-02T03:34:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-02T03:34:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> The latest master should not have `futures` as part of `requirements.txt` anymore.

I hope this will help others until it is permanently fixed...\r\n\r\nFor the \"World's Bank Data\" dashboard:\r\n\r\n- Select Sources --> Tables from the top-level menu.\r\n- Click on the \"Edit\" icon for the wb_health_population table.\r\n- Click on the \"List Columns\" tab.\r\n- Scroll down to the \"year\" column.\r\n- Click on the \"Edit\" icon for the \"year\" column.\r\n- In the \"Expression\" box, enter \"year ::timestamptz\" (without the double quotes).\r\n- Click on the \"Save\" button.\r\n- Access/Refresh the dashboard.\r\n\r\nI had another issue with the \"World's Bank Data\" dashboard - some charts were erroring out with 'column \"xxxx\" does not exist'. For example, 'column \"sp_pop_totl\" does not exist'. To fix:\r\n\r\n- Select Sources --> Tables from the top-level menu.\r\n- Click on the \"Edit\" icon for the wb_health_population table.\r\n- Click on the List Metrics tab.\r\n- Find the metric for the offending column. For example, sum__SP_POP_TOTL and click on its \"Edit\" icon.\r\n- Surround the column name in the \"SQL Expression\" field with double quotes.
