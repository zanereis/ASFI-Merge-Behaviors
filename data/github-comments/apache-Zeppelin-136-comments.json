They will need to just select proper `transform.method` what they need.\r\n- this is actually possible because many chart libraries share some abstracted models. And these models are not that different. We just need to support few things. Of course we might not support all models.

So should i rebase once again or there's some other issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/287825640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/287826291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2161#issuecomment-287826291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2161","id":287826291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzgyNjI5MQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-20T17:01:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T17:01:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Current jenkins script check only https://travis-ci.org/khalidhuseynov/zeppelin/ not https://travis-ci.org/khalidhuseynov/incubator-zeppelin/.

Sorry for late reply. 😭... \r\n\r\n### I can't reproduce the original issue reported in 1492 in current master\r\n\r\nUsually, paragraph is updated If interpreter updates fields in paragraph object properly for example `dataFinished`. \r\nI am not sure there is an case when **other paragraph fields are exactly same and only `paragraph.text` is different**. Only in this case, paragraph will not be updated in current implementation. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n// https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/f43d27f0bd9f841d71450ae303dc6f9f671bae0a/zeppelin-web/src/app/notebook/paragraph/paragraph.controller.js#L1123\r\n\r\n  newPara.dateFinished !== oldPara.dateFinished || \r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think `newPara.text !== oldPara.text ||` is good because it's more accurate condition on if stmt. \r\n\r\n![1492-cant-reproduce](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/24195725/43794b80-0f3e-11e7-871f-a88ad51cc82d.gif)\r\n\r\n### I can't reproduce focus issue too\r\n\r\nin 1492, @FRosner said that \r\n\r\n> 1. Enter code in a cell\r\n> 2. Remove the focus to rename the notebook\r\n> 3. The code gets reset\r\n\r\nBut I can't reproduce in current master.\r\n\r\n![1492-focus](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/24196075/9e710a5e-0f3f-11e7-9343-58165e2cd63e.gif)\r\n\r\n### Save paragraphs automatically when focus is lost.\r\n\r\nSo this PR is more about **saving paragraph when focus is lost** instead of resolving the problem submitted in 1492.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$scope.editor.on('blur', function() {\r\n          handleFocus(false);\r\n +        $scope.saveParagraph($scope.paragraph);\r\n        });\t\t        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn current implementation Zeppelin will save when user refresh browsers.

@1ambda.\r\n\r\nWhat are the implications of this change? \r\n\r\nIn the scenario you describe, it makes sense.
