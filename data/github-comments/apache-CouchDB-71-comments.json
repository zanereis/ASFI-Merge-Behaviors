was able to resolve this after creating the three system databases manually on startup in another shell, while the couchdb instance was running in the first shell as per

pointed out an interesting issue with this Pull Request. We have an ancient pattern in Mango which does a `module_loaded(dreyfus_index)` to check for the presence of Dreyfus before advertising text indexes. In release mode that module is not loaded on startup, so even if Dreyfus is included in a release the check can fail. Oops!\r\n\r\nA trivial switch here would be to use `dreyfus_sup` instead of `dreyfus_index` as the former will be loaded as part of the supervision tree, but that doesn't actually confirm a working

Here's a summary how CouchDB behaves when Clouseau is not connected:\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n* Updates to a Search design document (i.e., one with a top-level `\"indexes\"` field) **succeed**. I doubt we want to change this as it would have significant implications for replication.\r\n* Search requests fail after ~30 seconds with a 500 status code and `{\"error\":\"timeout\",\"reason\":\"The request could not be processed in a reasonable amount of time.\"}`. This could be improved.\r\n\r\n### Mango\r\n\r\n* Attempts to create a Mango text index via the `_index` endpoint fail ~immediately with a 503 status and the following response: `{\"error\":\"required index service unavailable\",\"reason\":\"text\"}`. I think this is the right behavior.\r\n* The Mango query optimizer will skip any existing \"text\" indexes if the Clouseau subsystem is not available at query time. This could result in a previously fast query falling back to a full database scan. I'm OK with this.\r\n\r\nI think there are three followups:\r\n\r\n1. Reject the Search request immediately instead of timing out with a generic error\r\n1. Consider some retry logic to mask Clouseau reboots during upgrades as suggested by @rnewson. I could see doing a short bounded exponential backoff for a couple of seconds.\r\n1. Quantify the cost of the RPC-based check for Clouseau's presence; both the amount of time to do the check, and the number of times the check is invoked in the request path for a healthy system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/502330265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/502363197","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2054#issuecomment-502363197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2054","id":502363197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjM2MzE5Nw==","user":{"login":"raoyitao","id":8922993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjI5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8922993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao","html_url":"https://github.com/raoyitao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raoyitao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-15T12:33:53Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T03:39:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"And

For example instead of relying on `run_on_modified_server` it might be possible to use `@moduletag config`\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefmodule CookieAuthTest do\r\n  ...\r\n  @moduletag config: [\r\n     {\"chttpd_auth\", \"authentication_db\", db_name},\r\n     {\"chttpd_auth\", \"auth_cache_size\", \"3\"},\r\n     {\"httpd\", \"authentication_handlers\", \"{couch_httpd_auth, default_authentication_handler}\"},\r\n     {\"chttpd_auth\", \"secret\", generate_secret(64)}  \r\n  ]\r\n  test \"that the users db is born with the auth ddoc\" do\r\n     ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test \"we can't create _names\" do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test \"we can't create malformed ids\" do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test \"login works\" do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test \"can't delete another users doc unless you are admin\" do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test \"redirect on success\" do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  test \"redirect on failure\" do\r\n    ...\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  ...and so on...\r\nend\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/504175553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/504439968","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2037#issuecomment-504439968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2037","id":504439968,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDQzOTk2OA==","user":{"login":"kocolosk","id":16679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk","html_url":"https://github.com/kocolosk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T14:10:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T14:10:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Doing a traditional merge commit here to be consistent with our past process on `git-subtree` merges.

Couchdb is a blackbox neatly integrated with the Application Layer, thus greatly simplifying maintenance and system administration).\r\n\r\nFiltered replication is particularly nice with this regard, since it becomes extremely easy to create clusters of multimedia attachments to balance load. For example, one cluster may only contains replicated videos, and the Application Layer uses Command-Query separation to route the user to the right cluster depending on the type of Query being performed. All of this is transparent from the application's perspective, the various addresses of clusters handling specific query types simply need to be configured during the deployment of the application, and further load balancing can be done at the DNS level.\r\n\r\nCouchDb hugely simplifies the infrastructure work. The management of large multimedia clusters becomes a breeze with continuous filtered replication, and consumption by application users is very efficient thanks to CouchDb support for HTTP range requests. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to retain the ability to have large documents / attachments / requests sizes for those who know what they are doing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/507043600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/507833848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2067#issuecomment-507833848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2067","id":507833848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzgzMzg0OA==","user":{"login":"chewbranca","id":5326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca","html_url":"https://github.com/chewbranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T20:32:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T20:32:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here's an initial version exposing the ICU sort key logic: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/compare/2067-add-get-sort-key","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/507833848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/508087636","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2053#issuecomment-508087636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2053","id":508087636,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODA4NzYzNg==","user":{"login":"sarveshtamba","id":37213716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjEzNzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37213716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba","html_url":"https://github.com/sarveshtamba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarveshtamba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T13:14:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T13:14:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @sarveshtamba from error, i can see that database can't be created due to timeout.
