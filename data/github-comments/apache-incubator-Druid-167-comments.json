guys for the review.\r\n\r\nI think there might be several issues beyond this failure. I could reproduce this timeout failure with a lazy executorService which sleeps for 10 secs before every ```execute()``` call, and, in this case, it was because of the missing ```CHILD_REMOVED``` event described above.\r\n\r\nI also checked Announcer, but couldn't find any race condition. Even if it has a race condition, I bet it does not relate to this timeout issue because AnnouncerTest is essentially single-threaded. For all operations executed in background (write on ZK), it immediately checks the result of those operations or waits for them to be finished using latch. \r\n\r\nHowever, yeah, it still fails sometimes. I'm not sure why this happens.\r\nI'm testing this patch by running travis CI multiple times. Hopefully this patch helps to reduce the timeout failure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/344110623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/344115926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4754#issuecomment-344115926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4754","id":344115926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDExNTkyNg==","user":{"login":"b-slim","id":7376396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzYzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7376396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim","html_url":"https://github.com/b-slim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-slim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T01:29:23Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T01:29:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\n\n\n\nReviewed 17 of 298 files at r1.\nReview status: all files reviewed at latest revision, 14 unresolved discussions, some commit checks failed.\n\n---\n\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/druid-io/druid/4754)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/344115926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/344120164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4815#issuecomment-344120164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4815","id":344120164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDEyMDE2NA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-14T01:53:47Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T01:53:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pjain1 sorry for delay.
