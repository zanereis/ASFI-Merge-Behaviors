I might be too early in the plugin dependency cleaning process. But still, I [can't find any _direct_ import of Babel itself](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=babel) in Airflow's code base.\n\nThere's [no direct reference in Qubole operators](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/24d41b8909840451c1ef7d70c1c7671e6d87528c/airflow/contrib/operators/qubole_operator.py#L14-L18) either. Nor there is any reference to [Babel in Qubole's SDK](https://github.com/qubole/qds-sdk-py/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=babel).\n\nSo even if there's a hidden dependency somewhere, it's already taken into account by sub-packages: all [unit-tests are passing](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-airflow/builds/145016866).\n\nI'm annoyed by this restrictive dependency. There's no point of being too conservative in this case. We can safely get rid of Babel requirement.\n\nIf you still do not want to remove it, we can compromise by either:\n- Move Babel requirement from the general section to the [`qds` section](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/9f49f12853d83dd051f0f1ed58b5df20bfcfe087/setup.py#L156), along the requirement on `qds-sdk`.\n- Remove the Babel hard-limit on the 1.x series as such: `babel>=1.3` [instead of `babel>=1.3, <2.0`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/9f49f12853d83dd051f0f1ed58b5df20bfcfe087/setup.py#L180).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/234251875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/234328022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1668#issuecomment-234328022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1668","id":234328022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDMyODAyMg==","user":{"login":"aoen","id":1592778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTI3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen","html_url":"https://github.com/aoen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T17:40:16Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T18:20:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Gotcha, thanks for investigating.

 nice catch on filtering out 'backfill_' jobs in the scheduler. \n\nA minor concern I have is that although max_active_run is respected by backfill, backfill itself can still create more active dagruns than max_active_run. \n\n@aoen mentioned that end goal is to make the backfill use the scheduler. How I interpreted it: instead of having backfill do everything locally and independently (the way it is now), backfillJob would instead only create dagruns, and scheduleJob (which is the scheduler) would pick them up from db along with other scheduled dagruns to process all of them in a consistent manner. I am not sure if this interpretation is correct, but if it is, then it may be beyond the scope of this PR anyways.

Further considering the max amount of dag runs in backfills creates a bit of an issue. As the BackfillJob waits on all runs to finish before it exits should I then wait for active_dag_runs < max_dag_runs which can be arbitrarily long?\n\nBackfillJobs should indeed be scheduled, but although the change to the backfilljob logic is relatively small, all tests need to be updated.
