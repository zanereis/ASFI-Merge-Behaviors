ZK connections spawned by HConnections also tend to create a lot of threads on the client side. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the connection-throttling framework in Phoenix is per-CQSI, so creating lots of CQSIs for similar clients  connecting to the same cluster greatly reduces the effectiveness of the throttle.
