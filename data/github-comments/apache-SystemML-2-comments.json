Just a couple of cleanups required:\n\n1) Rewrite: By adding VAR to LOOKUP_VALID_ROW_COL_AGGREGATE, it looks as if the general case rewrites for row/col aggregate do also apply, which is, however, not always the case. The reason why it works is the correct ordering of your new rewrites. However, you still want to use the case for rowVars -> var if we have just a single row. I would recommend to either (a) add an additional constraint to the general case rewrites, or (b) remove VAR from LOOKUP_VALID_ROW_COL_AGGREGATE and add the second general case to the specific VAR rewrites.\n2) Tests: It would be great if we could increase the coverage of these new testcases. First, please use a dense sparsity of 1.0>x>0.4 instead of 1.0 in order to include 0s for dense as well. Second, please make both dimensions larger than 1000 (our default blocksize) in order to test aggregation in the distributed case (your column var test already has that but we should do the same for row var too). Third, since variance requires special handling of 0s, it would be good to include empty input matrices as well.\n3) Runtime: There are a couple of places where you explicitly initialize newly created arrays with 0. This is unnecessary because the Java specification guarantees that int/double arrays are 0-initialized. \n4) Comments (nice-to-have): It's nice that you added comments about the correction layout - you just might want to extend that (in one place) by (a) some note why var is included as actual value, and (b) why these values are sufficient (as all other intermediates can be reconstructed from these values)\n5) Commit messages (nice-to-have): As mentioned before, the key 'SYSTEMML' is just too long for commit messages - we might want to use the old SYSML for our commits. Similarly, I would leave away these compiler/optimizer/parser/runtime tags as they do not really provide any additional information.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/168864642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/169090952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/30#issuecomment-169090952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/30","id":169090952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTA5MDk1Mg==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-05T18:34:11Z","updated_at":"2016-01-05T18:34:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you @gweidner\n\nFor verification, I ran the test suite again with latest master rebased with these updates on a test branch [here](https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/jenkins/job/SystemML-OnDemand/43/).

I've incorporated the logic of the new rewrites into the existing general case rewrites with a specific constraint for each, and removed the new rewrites.\n2. I've updated the dense sparsity to be 0.7, increased the dimensions to 1234 x 1432, and added tests for empty cases.  Since standard deviation relies on variance operators internally, I've tried to keep the standard deviation tests simpler to avoid growing our testing time unnecessarily.\n3. I've removed those initializations.  However, I still see several zero-based initializations of the output `c` matrix in `LibMatrixAgg.java`, such as on [line 1960](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/sysml/runtime/matrix/data/LibMatrixAgg.java#L1960).  Is there a reason for those cases?\n4. I have added additional comments to `getCorrectionLocation(...)` in `PartialAggregate.java`, as seen [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/32/files#diff-18451b8f1f6069ae271d031fe6cbc008R219).\n5. I have removed the compiler, optimizer, runtime, and parser tags from the title.  While \"SYSTEMML-###\" is a bit long, I am concerned that changing this to \"SYSML-###\" could cause confusion.  For example, if someone wanted to look up the associated JIRA, searching for \"SYSML-###\" in a search engine would not pull up the JIRA issue, while \"SYSTEMML-###\" would.\n\n**NOTE**:  This cleanup is still a work in progress.  Extending the test cases to have both dimensions > 1000, thus triggering the parallel threaded execution, exposes fairly consistent, yet somewhat random, failures, mostly in the CP cases.  The variances are somewhat close, but different enough to definitely cause concern.  The incremental aggregation uses the existing logic in `CM.java` for the aggregation.  The symptoms point towards possible numerical stability issues, off-by-one issues, or some other type of bug.  I will continue looking into it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/169525621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/169549673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/32#issuecomment-169549673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/32","id":169549673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTU0OTY3Mw==","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-07T04:46:46Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T04:46:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for the cleanups. \nad 3: Yes, this is something we still need to cleanup - feel free make the change. \nad 5: OK, let's go consistently with the full SYSTEMML for now, once it becomes too annoying and we all agree on a prefix, we can revisit this.\nad note: Yes, we need to follow up on this one. Does it only happen for column aggregates? If yes, we would need to look at the final aggregation. Does it only happen for variance? One thing to keep in mind is that the epsilon in our tests is used as an absolute not relative tolerance - this implies that we expect larger errors for variance than for standard deviation because the former operates on squared values (and your generated data has a large enough domain).

I figured out the problem -- thread contention involving the `_buff2` object in the `CM` function object during threaded variance calculations, located at [line 177](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/32/files#diff-d9237face00cb50c86d8ebb855c20000L177).  Since our unary aggregate framework uses the same function object for each thread, the `_buff2` object was getting updated by multiple threads.  This `_buff2` is used as a buffer to calculate the updated `m2` values without updating the original `m2` object -- it appears to be useful for the other moment calculations, but extraneous for the variance calculation.  Thus, I have removed it, and changed it to update the `m2` object directly.  Was there an additional design decision behind this?  If not, I'd like to also clean it up at [line 285](https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/32/files#diff-d9237face00cb50c86d8ebb855c20000L285).\n\nThe row/column/full variance and standard deviation tests are passing locally now.
