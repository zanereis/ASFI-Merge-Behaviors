Thanks for the comments, It builds fine on my machine, I wanted to see how it did against CI.  Been out of town for a wedding over the holiday weekend (in US Monday was a holiday). I didn't think anyone would look at it before today, and apologies for not outlining things more clearly.  Looking at the fail logs, it seems like flakey fails, but I'll investigate further this evening.  \n\n@Leemoonsoo also thanks for the comments. \nI do have some documentation on this as well at:\nhttps://trevorgrant.org/2016/05/19/visualizing-apache-mahout-in-r-via-apache-zeppelin-incubating/\n\nI agree there are those two approaches, and will present a 3rd where 'Mahout' lives as it's own interpreter.\n\nso approach (1) a patch, approach (2) documentation only, approach (3) a stand alone interpreter.\n\nIn general, options 1 and 3 make integrating Apache Mahout into notebooks more 'turn-key' and since one of the primary use cases of Apache Zeppelin is data discovery analytics, this seems like a natural fit that would benefit both projects AND end users.  Cons of 1 and 3 are that they add code that must be maintained; as far as invasiveness of patch and code which must be maintained, 1 is vastly superior to 3 (for 3 we would be basically copy and pasting the spark interpretter over with this patch applied). I do agree with Moon's comments above for paramter setting based on 'spark.mahout=true/false\" this is to bzz's point WIP.\n\nSo pros/cons of approach 2 is in essence the inverse of 1 and 3. The pro: no additional code to maintain (though a blog post which must be maintained as I've learned the hard way re my post on Installing Zeppelin with Spark and Flink), the cons of which: while Zeppelin does make all of the steps required fairly easy, the steps required to add Mahout support would be at least fairly considered an \"intermediate\" Zeppelin skill level.  This is a barrier to entry to several Apache Mahout users who are excited to see this integration as a means for visualization in Mahout.\n\nMy .02.

This is expected to reduce confusion in the development of the future. \n\nSecond, duplicate code, I think also that it is a problem. However, when you use a class named notebook socket for job communication in jobmanager, misleading, it was thought to be able to misleading developers.
