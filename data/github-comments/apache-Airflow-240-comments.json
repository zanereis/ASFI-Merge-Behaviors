To answer your questions:\r\n\r\n> * So each gunicorn worker going to launch a separate thread to parse DAGs asynchronously, and not a single background process going to do the DAG parsing for all the workers.\r\n\r\nYes. Each gunicorn worker now has a separate process to collect DAGs. A single background process is possible with more code change in airflow/www/views.py. We can discuss whether it is needed. \r\n\r\nOne drawback of using a process for each gunicorn worker is that the 'collect dags' process consumes most of memory. Usually users want to use async_dag_loader when they have many DAGs (>1,000), so the webserver is very memory intense. So we also suggest users to use [webserver] workers = 1.\r\n\r\n> * The pickled DAG object won't be stored into DB and just used for thread communication.\r\n\r\nNo. They are not stored in DB and just in memory now. We are working on storing them in DB (just like DagPickle in Airflow, but we store stringified DAGs instead), so UI does not need to run DAG code any more. Scheduler can also use stringified DAGs to accelerate scheduling actions (to be tested out).\r\n\r\n> * As of now each gunicorn worker might have diff copy of DAGs (due to changes) and cause confusion on UI, something which isn't going to solve with this change.\r\n\r\nYes. This PR does not change this inconsistency problem. The solution can be a future PR that:\r\n(1) as you mentioned, use a single DAG collecting process for all gunicorn workers;\r\nor (2) reading cached DAGs from DB in webserver\r\n\r\n> * How it going to behave if DAG parsing time for each thread is more than the configured `collect_dags_interval` time.\r\n\r\nIf the process takes longer than collect_dags_interval, it will immediately start the next round of collection. There is no sleep between two rounds of collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511901734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/511909913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5594#issuecomment-511909913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5594","id":511909913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTkwOTkxMw==","user":{"login":"coufon","id":11655397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU1Mzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11655397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon","html_url":"https://github.com/coufon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coufon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T17:25:04Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T17:45:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi Jarek, thanks for your comments. Here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\n> a starting point to implement part of DAG persistence\r\n\r\nWe are working on storing 'stringified DAG' into DB to be used by webserver and scheduler. We found it is straightforward now because 'stringified DAG' is always picklable. I will send out an AIP soon. This change (still use current DAG classes) is not as fundamental as:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-18+Persist+all+information+from+DAG+file+in+DB\r\n\r\n> maybe you can share your experiences with an actual \"production\" usage of this?\r\n\r\nWe implement async_dag_loader in Composer because we observe there are more and more users running a large amount of DAGs in one Airflow cluster. Webserver frequently goes down because 'collecting DAG time' > 'webserver gunicorn worker refreshing time'. So this feature is suggested for all users to run >= 1,000 DAGs.\r\n\r\nEven now we have async_dag_loader, there is still a memory issue. Composer runs Airflow webserver on a separate VM. Collecting thousands of DAGs is memory intense (DAG objects are not very memory consuming though). Therefore, users may still find webserver down due to OOM. Therefore we suggest users to have [webserver] workers=1. We are currently working on storing 'stringified DAGs' in DB  as the solution.\r\n\r\n> casting to BaseOperator for non-airflow modules\r\n\r\nThere may be errors in unpickling classes defined in non-airflow modules. These modules are imported in 'DAG collecting' processes, but not imported in webserver main process. Unpickling them would lead to 'module not found' errors. If we import these modules in webserver main processes, we have to process DAG files, it goes back to sync DAG loading again.\r\n\r\nHere is an example: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/example_dags/example_skip_dag.py\r\n\r\nIn this Airflow test DAG, these is a non-airflow operator \"class DummySkipOperator\" (not defined in airflow/operators or airflow/contrib/operators). The DAG containing that operator can not be unpickled unless we replace that with BaseOperator.\r\n\r\nThe scheduler has a similar story. DAG collecting processes import these custom modules (classes), but they only send SimpleDAG back to scheduler job's main process (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/utils/dag_processing.py#L51).

Correction. I actually think this is a UI bug. When you click a task, the \"Downstream\" and \"Recursive\" options are enabled for the Clear option. But in 10.1.3, these options are (also? only?) tied to the Mark Failed option. So when I try to mark a single task as failed, all downstream tasks are mark as failed. Deselecting the \"Downstream\" and \"Recursive\" options then selecting Mark Failed will now only mark as failed the selected task, not all downstream tasks.\r\n\r\nIGNORE:\r\nI'm noticing some change in behavior in 1.10.3 that might be related to this. Forgive me if I'm totally off here. In 1.10.2, when you set a task to failed in the UI, all dependent downstream tasks would get skipped. Now, they all insta-fail, and even tasks which have all_done triggers are not running and are marked as failed, whereas in 1.10.2 they would execute. Bug? Feature? Or should I direct my observations elsewhere.\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/512564946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/512566436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5602#issuecomment-512566436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5602","id":512566436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjU2NjQzNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T20:59:26Z","updated_at":"2019-09-08T23:38:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

The comments are helpful. Using stringified DAG does lose information on UI, I would like to iterate more on how to minimize this loss. To your questions:\r\n\r\n> This limitation needs to be addressed, it would make dags using custom operators apperar wrong in the UI wouldn't it?\r\n\r\nYes. I agree we should improve this. We don't have this in the first version because we think UI down is a bigger issue. But we should consider this.\r\n\r\nMy initial idea to support this is to collect a list of module file paths in the DAG collecting subprocess. A module path is added if it detects a non-Airflow module. On the webserver main process, it firstly loads all modules in the list, then unpickled DAGs.\r\n\r\nThis maybe abused if the user defines Operators in each DAG file: it goes back to the case that webserver process has to load all DAGs files. But as long as the user defined Operator in shared modules. It would be a small overhead. How does it sound?\r\n\r\n> Additionally I would like to see more detail about what the stringified form is - I don't see any explicit tests covering this.\r\n\r\nThe stringified form is that all fields that can not be pickled or unpickled are replaced.

I know I can work around this by adding a short circuit operator and running the dag everyday, but then I have to add an extra operator to every dag that I want to behave this way and if I'm looking at dag run times, I'll have artificially lower numbers on the weekends.\r\n\r\nYou have DayOfWeekSensor\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/512641474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/512704867","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4938#issuecomment-512704867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4938","id":512704867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjcwNDg2Nw==","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T07:46:23Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T07:46:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"WOW great job @potiuk !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/512704867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/512713251","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4633#issuecomment-512713251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4633","id":512713251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjcxMzI1MQ==","user":{"login":"chaimt","id":4221415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjE0MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4221415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt","html_url":"https://github.com/chaimt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaimt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T08:12:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T08:12:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RosterIn -

I am not familiar with that part of the code but I took a quick look and I have a few comments. Possibly I do not understand all consequences but let me do some thought experiment:\r\n\r\n1) I assume the Dag loaded via DagBag is mainly used to load it as python object for structural analysis and later render the UI graphs/charts/tabs etc.\r\n2) To display the code in UI we use the original source code rather than stringified version (so no impact of stringification here) - at least that looks like from the code :)\r\n3) The \"BaseOperator\" problem will show up in the UI where we look for DagRuns, Gant Charts and other places where the DAG object structure is used.\r\n4) When you get to \"Rendered template\" screen you get an error in case of lambda functions etc.\r\n5) Custom fields are replaced in stringified form with <main.A object at 0x7f4121780828> - but it should not (?) have impact on anything displayed in the UI.\r\n\r\nSo maybe those simple hacks will work:\r\n1) That's already solved by stringified form that provides the structure\r\n2) Here we have no problem as source code is used directly\r\n3) Why don't we inject \"airflow_class_name = 'ClassName'\" field in the stringified BaseOperator while we stringify it and use it as the name displayed in the UI (and everywhere where needed)? I think that might be really simple solution. No problems with loading the external modules (cause there is no need - we only need name from what I understand)\r\n4) Why don't we load the \"real\" DAG just to display the templated fields - when they are actually clicked ? That will surely cause delays when displaying the tab, but maybe it's better than error. It should be rather easy - you can create a separate DagBag with just the single Dag as \"folder\" and from what I know, it should load that DAG (and then you could figure out and load needed modules before you display it). Maybe that's a solution (but also maybe it's not that necessary to fix this particular tab in this - really - edge case.\r\n5) I believe it's not a problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/513080601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/513088104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4821#issuecomment-513088104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4821","id":513088104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzA4ODEwNA==","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T04:42:56Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T04:42:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Conflicts resolved @ashb.

@ashb. I think this one is important for 1.10.4.\r\n\r\nI believe we are going to have another RC for 1.10.4 (I guess?) - then it's worth that this one is merged (possibly after my proposal with <> 0 works for @pemontto and he can double-check this with their MySql DB).\r\n\r\nIt seems like airflow 1.10.3 and previous ones with Kubernetes will not cleanly install on the latest Mysql 8.0.16 because of this BOOL Check constraint. If we have not yet made decision about 1.10.4 RC - this might be quite important issue to be added to 1.10.4 - so that people will have a stable Airflow version that they can use with latest MySQL.
