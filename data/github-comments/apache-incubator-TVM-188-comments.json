For re-formatting, I didn't intentionally reformat the unit test file. VSCode by default auto-formats the file once I paste some code. I was even considering to revert auto-formatting due to the reason you pointed out. However, I checked the re-formatting and it is mostly just blank and too-long lines, so I think it should be fine for this small feature PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635637903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635640183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5689#issuecomment-635640183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5689","id":635640183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTY0MDE4Mw==","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T22:23:48Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T22:23:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\n%2 = fn (%input: Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 3), uint8], Composite=\"qnn_conv2d\") -> Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), uint8] {\r\n    %0 = qnn.conv2d(%input, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(3, 3, 3, 64), uint8] */ /* ty=Tensor[(3, 3, 3, 64), uint8] */, 115 /* ty=int32 */, 134 /* ty=int32 */, 1f /* ty=float32 */, 0.00503911f /* ty=float32 */, padding=[1, 1, 1, 1], channels=64, kernel_size=[3, 3], data_layout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWIO\", out_dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), int32] */;\r\n    %1 = nn.bias_add(%0, meta[relay.Constant][1] /* ty=Tensor[(64), int32] */ /* ty=Tensor[(64), int32] */, axis=3) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), int32] */;\r\n    qnn.requantize(%1, 0.00503911f /* ty=float32 */, 0 /* ty=int32 */, 3.26957f /* ty=float32 */, 0 /* ty=int32 */, out_dtype=\"uint8\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 224, 224, 64), uint8] */\r\n  };\r\n```\r\nWould be an example of the composite function I'd expect if I matched the weight of the conv as a constant (this is the old merge composite behaviour for that case).\r\n\r\nI think the most logical behaviour is for constants to remain embedded where they are explicitly part of the pattern and to lift them where they are not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635640183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635643165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5617#issuecomment-635643165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5617","id":635643165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTY0MzE2NQ==","user":{"login":"deepakbabel23","id":59532278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTMyMjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59532278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23","html_url":"https://github.com/deepakbabel23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakbabel23/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T22:32:34Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T22:32:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srkreddy1238,\r\nI have incorporated all your review comments.

If the visitor is called only twice, we shouldn't have had such issues at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635658618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635663626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5689#issuecomment-635663626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5689","id":635663626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTY2MzYyNg==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T23:09:38Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T23:11:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK I can finally reproduce this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn (%x: Tensor[(1, 3, 224, 224), float32], %b: Tensor[(3), float32]) -> Tensor[(1, 3, 222, 222), float32] {\r\n  %1 = fn (%x1: Tensor[(1, 3, 224, 224), float32], %b1: Tensor[(3), float32], Composite=\"pat\") -> Tensor[(1, 3, 222, 222), float32] {\r\n    %0 = nn.conv2d(%x1, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(3, 3, 3, 3), float64] */ /* ty=Tensor[(3, 3, 3, 3), float64] */, padding=[0, 0, 0, 0]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 3, 222, 222), float32] */;\r\n    nn.bias_add(%0, %b1) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 3, 222, 222), float32] */\r\n  };\r\n  %1(%x, %b) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 3, 222, 222), float32] */\r\n}\r\n// meta data omitted. you can use show_meta_data=True to include meta data\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nCombining wih the previous example, we know that old `MergeComposite` preserves constant node when the pattern is also a constant; otherwise it will lift constant nodes.

Maybe we should develop an improved `StmtExprMutator`, which can track the updates to the nodes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635739066/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635742328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5650#issuecomment-635742328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5650","id":635742328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTc0MjMyOA==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-29T03:51:37Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T03:51:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One potential problem is that it may break downstream deployment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635742328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/635744914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5650#issuecomment-635744914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5650","id":635744914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTc0NDkxNA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-29T04:02:31Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T04:02:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We could mark build_config as deprecation, and remove that API in the next release cycle.
