On reading your README and the code further, it seems like in Pure RPC mode, it's just the standard TVM RPC server. Does that match your understanding? Apologies, I thought there was something I didn't understand in the iOS project configuration depending on gRPC.\r\n> \r\n> I've also read through your README more thoroughly now and added a couple of suggestions for readability.\r\n\r\nYou are right. In Pure RPC we mean just the standard RPC server. We name it Pure in the code and documentation only because it doesn't have any additional logic like connecting to tracker or proxy. If you are confused about the name, we could rename it. \r\n\r\nThank you for your comments about README. I updated almost all your comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/922750354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/922805387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9047#issuecomment-922805387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9047","id":922805387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43AOSL","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T10:33:20Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T10:33:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Got

In my mind, the introduction of AOTExecutor (and actually also VMExecutor) means that this is moving one level up. Here is why:\r\n- previously, the maximum effective call depth of a TIR function was 1, meaning that codegen could decide *then and there* that it made sense to move a particular local `tir.allocate` node onto the stack.\r\n- with the introduction of AOT and control flow VMExecutor, such `tir.allocate` may now live while another TIR function is being invoked e.g. with `tir.call_packed`.\r\n\r\nNow that this is the case, it doesn't make sense to make stack-allocation of `tir.allocate` a codegen-level optimization. It must be done prior to codegen using graph-level memory analysis e.g. USMP.\r\n\r\nThen question then is how to model this in the program. I think using `storage_scope` does make sense. The definition I've been working with of a `storage_scope` is:\r\n> A contiguous region of memory, potentially with a maximum size, which can be used by operator implementations on a set of `tvm.Device`.\r\n\r\nUnder this definition, a special `<context>.stack` `storage_scope` could be created with a target-specific bound on the amount of memory available. I do not think we should create a default `global` scope anywhere, as it's unlikely a global scope is truly ever global except in the case of single-CPU homogenous model execution. We just haven't modeled this yet in TVM, as we don't have an explicit mapping indicating which storage_scope are accessible by which device. The closest thing to a global scope I can think of would be something like `executor` scope, which could be used to place `DLTensor` used by the AOT executor for intermediate tensors.\r\n\r\nSomething we still have yet to address is how to configure the `storage_scope` made available for a particular Target. I think the Target-specific attributes may not quite cut it, as `llvm` obviously would have different amounts of stack RAM available based on the selected CPU. And, the user will need to be able to override this as well, since sometimes linking with different software libraries reduces the stack RAM available (e.g. some libraries require more global memory and therefore take away from that RAM available for stack usage; or other times, some libraries require massive interrupt stacks and a larger budget must be reserved to mitigate the risk of overwriting global memory due to an interrupt).\r\n\r\nIt's likely that a scalable solution in micro-land is to have the Project API server able to provide a boilerplate set of `storage_scope` in an e.g. `server_info_query` call; and then it's likely we will need to have a way for users to override this.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to the `<context>` prefix mentioned above: there are many cases when multiple stacks exist on a device:\r\n- multi-core execution\r\n- parallel thread execution (e.g. stack viewed as a sort of thread-local storage)\r\n\r\nin the former case, it's likely that `<context>` should be replaced with the `name` given to the TargetDevice e.g. in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8892. For example `dsp.stack` or `always-on-cpu.stack`.\r\n\r\nin the latter case, we probably additionally need a thread identifier e.g. `dsp.thread0.stack`.\r\n\r\nUntil we have USMP, my thoughts are that the short-term solution should be to stick with a codegen-level optimization and add an attribute which can be used to disable the stack-allocation optimization. What do you think @tqchen @manupa-arm

There are certain memories (e.g. stack) that could be 'owned' by a TargetDevice -- in which case we could do \\<TargetDevice\\>.stack.  In a way, stack is special as it does not create an opaque call to get hold of the memory, so that LLVM (or any other post-TVM compiler) could do optimizations. Hence, my emphasis on treating it especially with 'local' storage_scope. However, I think it would be too big of a change given the historical precedence of TVM, as @tqchen points out.\r\n\r\nHowever, in shared memory SoCs, the ownership of memories to TargetDevice will not scale very well. For e.g., if we have a SRAM that is accessed by  CPU, DSP, and NPU in the same SoC, what should be the prefix? The current approach we are taking (and discussed in the RFC) of USMP is to use the storage_scope: global.<pool_name> where pool_name points to PoolInfo that describes which TargetDevice have access to it. Therefore, I believe we could make an Arena that is pinned to the memories in the runtime layer to serve each Pool via TVMBAWs. If USMP is invoked, the static-sized allocations will be translated to fixed offsets within a static buffer pinned to the same memories. I guess my point is the provision of Arenas/buffers should be lifted out of the codegen to the application/runtime layer and interfaced by generated codes via TVMBAWs (for non-static sized allocates) or offset (for static-sized allocates).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/923686813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/923699688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9036#issuecomment-923699688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9036","id":923699688,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43Dono","user":{"login":"PhilippvK","id":7712605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTI2MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7712605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK","html_url":"https://github.com/PhilippvK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PhilippvK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-21T07:06:05Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T07:08:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@areusch Thanks for looking into this.

It should also be reproducible for other models by increasing the length of model name passed to the `build` function by some amount. As the limit of 120 characters for a function name is hardcoded, an the model name prefix can be arbitrary there is no general solution for this. But the `default` model name should not lead to any issues in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/924330265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/924331320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9046#issuecomment-924331320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9046","id":924331320,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43GC04","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-21T19:48:21Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T19:48:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Echo @areusch.
