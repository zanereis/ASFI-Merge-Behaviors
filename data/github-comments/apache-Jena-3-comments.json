this PR to cover #60, #61, #62, #63)\n\nOverall - it helps me to have the codebase be warning-free so it is easy to spot when new warnings arise. If there are already some, then it is much less clear when new ones appear.  By marking code \"suppress warnings\" it shows that some one has checked the warning and okay'ed it.\n\n_Unthrown checked exceptions_: many (not all but most in my sampling) of these are where the interface declaration has an exception but the code implementation does not throw it currently.\n\nAutogenerated code from Eclipse for an interface will include the exception declaration and it is a right to have a later change and then throw the exception. This will have an effect if the app code is using the implementing class, so when an interface is part, not all, of a classes contract.\n\nIf they are from an interface, I'd prefer to keep them; if they are just stray out of date stuff, they should go.  If the tool can't tell the difference, keep for now as they seem to be the vast majority.\n\n_Unnecessary superinterface declarations_: this is style - if inheriting from a base class. it can be clearer to keep the \"implement interface\". I don't see a need to remove them.\n\n<insert many general debates about interface and implementation inheritance here>.\n\nThe interface may be part of the whole classes contract so clearly stating it just seems like clarity to me.\n\n_Needless typecasts_: probably a left-over from converting to generics and should be cleared.  Or int/long conversion which also can be cleared up.\n\n_Unused imports_: my personal preference is no unused imports - this is the \"no warnings\" principle.\n\n_Unused variables_: almost always should go IMO\n\n_Unused fields_: almost always should go, occasional they are internal trackers like stats.\n\n_Unused private methods_: less clear to me - classes can have general capabilities that are not currently used but it's a shame to loose the capabilities.

It's just a case of a newbie showing up to an open source project who has to spend some time getting to know the rhythm before joining the dance.\n\nIt definitely sounds like some effort at \"codification\" (in the lightest and gentlest sense) would better repay than more wrangling on the code itself. It might benefit other latecomers, and if it seems to be getting bogged down in minutia or dogmatism, we can just cut it short and take forward whatever _was_ learnt.\n\nI'll shoot something to dev@ today. Here is a strawman:\n\nIt would be nice to have some rough code standards that would help newcomers without inhibiting anyone from contributing. Possible simple policies include:\n- Don't throw checked exceptions that aren't really ever thrown unless an API supertype specs it.\n- Don't leave unused imports in. Any IDE can solve that problem for you with one keystroke.\n- If a type declares a supertype that isn't a required declaration, consider whether that clarifies or confuses the intent. The former is okay, the latter not so good.\n- Minimize the compiler warnings your code throws up. If you use `@SuppressWarnings` to hide them, please add a comment explaining the situation or a TODO with a potential future fix that would allow removing the suppression.\n- Please remove unused local variables or fields or uninteresting private methods. If it's debugging detritus, consider adding formal logging code for future use, if it seems likely to be useful.\n- If there is valuable code in some unused private method, add a `@SuppressWarnings` with an explanation of when it might become useful. If there is valuable but \"dead\" code inside a \"live\" method, consider breaking it out into a private method and adding `@SuppressWarnings` and explanation.\n\nAfter discussion on the list and assuming that goes well, I'll take it to the CMS and to a ticket to start getting some feedback from Checkstyles from actual processing of the code.

As I've said before, I think a single index is preferable to multiple indexes. It should require less book-keeping overall.\n\nI have to say I don't like the current division of labor between TextIndexLucene and TextIndexLuceneMultilingual, with the latter having an isMultilingual() method that returns true, and all the actual multilingual support in TextIndexLucene.\n\nI think that ideally, TextIndexLucene should not be in any way aware of the multilingual aspects and should merely provide hooks or extension/override points that can then be used by TextIndexLuceneMultilingual to provide multilingual functionality.\n\nAs an example, instead of this (in TextIndexLucene around line 230):\n\n``` java\n            Analyzer analyzer = null;\n            if (isMultilingual())\n                analyzer = LuceneUtil.getLocalizedAnalyzer(entity.getLanguage());\n\n            if (analyzer != null)\n                indexWriter.addDocument(doc, analyzer) ;\n            else //use the default one\n                indexWriter.addDocument(doc) ;\n```\n\nyou could have something like this:\n\n``` java\n/* at the end of TextIndexLucene.addEntity() */\n      addDocument(entity);\n  }\n\n  /* extension point; can be overridden if necessary */\n  protected void addDocument(Entity entity) {\n       Document doc = doc(entity);\n       indexWriter.addDocument(doc);\n  }\n\n/* in TextIndexLuceneMultilingual */\n\n  @Override\n  protected void addDocument(Entity entity) {\n       Document doc = doc(entity);\n       Analyzer analyzer = LuceneUtil.getLocalizedAnalyzer(entity.getLanguage());\n       indexWriter.addDocument(doc, analyzer);\n  }\n```\n\nI understand that compromises sometimes have to be made, but putting all the multilingual support code in the TextIndexLucene class is, I think, pushing it too far. It also makes it hard to extend TextIndexLucene for other purposes.\n\nAnother thing: I don't quite understand the need to handle 3 letter language tags. AFAIU the relevant standards (RDF 1.0, XML 1.0, RDF 1.1) all specify that language tags should be formatted according to BCP 47 / RFC 4646 which, I think, states that when a 2 letter ISO 639-1 language tag exists, it should be used instead of the equivalent 3-letter ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 codes. So you should never see a literal such as \"book\"@eng in well-formed RDF data.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/101780700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/101808418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/64#issuecomment-101808418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/64","id":101808418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTgwODQxOA==","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-13T20:41:39Z","updated_at":"2015-05-13T21:50:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, I will separate it to have a distinct behavior. \n\n> So you should never see a literal such as \"book\"@eng in well-formed RDF data.\n\nYes unfortunaltely.

I don't have a need for language-specific analyzers (LowerCaseKeywordAnalyzer works better for the application, in all languages), but it could be useful to be able to target searches based on language - this way I could avoid some false hits from the text index and thus get faster queries overall. So I wonder if it would be possible to separate these two aspects:\n1. Store language tags of literals in the Lucene index and be able to restrict the query to a specific language with a query parameter\n2. Use different analyzers for different languages\n\nRight now your code does both, but it's not possible to do only 1. Obviously 2 depends on 1.\n\nHow about adding a new option \"langField\", similar to \"graphField\", that can be configured via the assembler (or as a constructor parameter, just like graphField).

I think decoupling these would be a good thing for other purposes too. For example, I have some plans to propose storing (optionally) the full literal values in the Lucene index, so that they can be used in SPARQL queries, and having the language tags in the index would help a bit with that.\n\nStill a couple more proposals:\n1. Your new LuceneUtil class appears to only contain (static) methods related to the multilingual analyzer. I propose moving those methods to TextIndexLuceneMultilingual and removing the LuceneUtil class, if there is no other use for it.\n2. The TextDatasetFactory methods for creating indexes are getting more and more convoluted as new parameters and variations are added. (I'm also guilty of this - when I added graphField support, I just made new versions of the methods with more parameters, but left in the old ones too for compatibility.) I think that it would make sense to introduce a new class TextIndexConfiguration which could be used to set only those parameters that are relevant to the use, something like this:\n\n``` java\nTextIndexConfiguration conf = new TextIndexConfiguration(entDef);\nconf.setAnalyzer(analyzer);\nconf.setGraphField(\"graph\");\nconf.setLanguageField(\"lang\");\nDataset dsLucene = TextDatasetFactory.createLucene(dsBase, \"textdir\", conf);\n```\n\nUsing a multilingual index could perhaps be a boolean flag (since it's not just a standard analyzer), like this:\n\n``` java\nconf.setMultilingualAnalyzer(true);\n```\n\nThis way, I think we could avoid blowing up the number of createLucene and createLuceneIndex methods further. There would only be one more variant of each method in TextDatasetFactory, taking a TextIndexConfiguration parameter. When new features are added (such as langField and multilingual indexing), these can be added to TextIndexConfiguration but there is no need for further createLucene-style methods. createLuceneIndexMultilingual could be dropped.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/102297487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/102398852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/64#issuecomment-102398852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/64","id":102398852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjM5ODg1Mg==","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T13:35:34Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T13:35:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes completely agree with that, otherwise TextDatasetFactory will be difficult to maintain.\nAnd no more need of TextIndexLuceneMultilingualAssembler also.\n\nTextIndexConfiguration should be about : analyzer, queryAnalyzer, multilingual,.. and graphField, langField concern EntityDefinition no ?\nMoreover, to avoid the same growing constructors, EntityDefinition should be configurable with setters/getters.\n\nJust a question about the usual worflow, who decides to integrate, or not, a proposed code ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/102398852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/102406631","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/64#issuecomment-102406631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/64","id":102406631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjQwNjYzMQ==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-15T14:00:24Z","updated_at":"2015-05-15T14:00:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> TextIndexConfiguration should be about : analyzer, queryAnalyzer, multilingual,.. and graphField, langField concern EntityDefinition no ?\n> Moreover, to avoid the same growing constructors, EntityDefinition should be configurable with setters/getters.\n\nOh yes, sorry, I was a bit confused about TextIndexFactory methods vs. EntityDefinition.

can now be stored in the index by providing a langField param to EntityDefinition (assembler and java code). So you can use a TexIndexLucene with your own analyzer and target language of localized literals.\n\n3 cases on Sparql clauses : \n`?s text:query (rdfs:label 'word' 'lang:en' )` will target english literals\n`?s text:query (rdfs:label 'word' 'lang:none')` will target unlocalized literals\n`?s text:query (rdfs:label 'word')` will ignore language\nNOTE: in Sparql queries, `lang` is a predefined keyword and the Lucene query will be mapped with the right langField name.  \n\nMoreover, TextIndexConfig class has been introduced and EntityDefinition refactored to simplify TextDatasetFactory as desired.\n\nLuceneUtil has moved as Util class in analyzer package. It still used with the LocalizedAnalyzerAssembler\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/103635153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/103646019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/64#issuecomment-103646019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/64","id":103646019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzY0NjAxOQ==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T19:33:41Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T19:33:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Excellent work! Looks almost ready for merging.\n\nA couple of comments:\n\n1.You say that \"?s text:query (rdfs:label 'word' 'lang:none') will target unlocalized literals\". But the code does this:\n\n``` java\n                String qs2 = !\"none\".equals(langArg)?\n                        field + \":\" + langArg : \"-\" + field + \":*\";\n```\n\nIn my understanding, this will do a wildcard search on the language field if the query argument is \"lang:none\". So it wouldn't be possible to search for non-language-tagged literals. Unless I'm missing something, I'd replace the above expression with simply this line:\n\n``` java\n                 String qs2 = field + \":\" + langArg;\n```\n\n2.You have now removed some of the old constructors from EntityDefinition and the create\\* methods from TextDatasetFactory (and had to change the example code and some unit tests accordingly). While this leads to cleaner code, it also breaks the API so old code has to be changed. This might actually be a good moment to do it, as Jena has just bumped the version number to 3 and other APIs are also being changed, but I think we need opinions on that. If it turns out to be too disruptive, then compatibility methods could be added back.\n\nCould you write a message to the dev@ list and explain your contribution? I could then join in with comments in favor of merging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/103646019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/103661706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/64#issuecomment-103661706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/64","id":103661706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzY2MTcwNg==","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-19T20:38:26Z","updated_at":"2015-05-19T20:40:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1) Not exactly, let's suppose that langField is used with name \"language\".\nIf lang arg == \"none\" in the Sparql query, then the query extension for Lucene will be :\n\n```\nString qs2 = \"-language:*\"\n```\n\nwith a minus before to exclude filled values\n\n2) Ok I will submit it to the dev list. \nIs there a required formatting on the message ?\nps: I will also mention the refactoring to obtain their advices on it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/103661706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/103778663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/64#issuecomment-103778663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/64","id":103778663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzc3ODY2Mw==","user":{"login":"osma","id":1132830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1132830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma","html_url":"https://github.com/osma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/osma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-20T06:34:57Z","updated_at":"2015-05-20T06:34:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> with a minus before to exclude filled values\n\nAh, I see.

Obviously there are now some merge conflicts that need to be resolved, but other than that, do you think it's ready for merging? I for one would like to see (a version of) this merged, because it would help a lot in making efficient text index queries if you could rely on the index not containing stale entries.\n\nLooking at the diffs, I see there are some changes to jena-arq that don't seem related to the main purpose of this code. Some of that is just cosmetic changes like adjusting whitespace. Then there is some QueryVisitor code, and some changes to ARQ tests. I doubt these patches are related to jena-text?\n\nA couple of notes on the jena-text part:\n1. You seem to always use the \"uid\" field to store the SHA-1 checksum. However, all other field names in jena-text, including entityField to store the URI, have so far been configurable using the assembler or EntityDefinition. Should this field name be made configurable as well? Not having it set could then mean \"backwards compatible mode\" where checksums are not stored and old entries are thus not deleted.\n2. You are using DigestUtils.shaHex() to calculate the checksum, but this seems to be a deprecated method nowadays. I suggest using sha1Hex() or one of the other more explicit variants instead.\n3. I'm not sure TextQueryFuncs.getLiteralLanguage is a very useful method (at least in its current form, with no error handling for null values etc), as one could just do node.getLiteral().getLanguage() directly. But this is a minor style issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/106801397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/106848124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/53#issuecomment-106848124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/53","id":106848124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNjg0ODEyNA==","user":{"login":"amiara514","id":5551714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5551714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514","html_url":"https://github.com/amiara514","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amiara514/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-29T15:33:18Z","updated_at":"2015-05-29T15:34:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@osma The status is still pending.

a lot Andy for your review!

Maybe @amiara514 would have a comment as I understood he is using jena-text via Java code?
