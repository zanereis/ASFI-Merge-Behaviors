I got couple of remarks/questions on the way it handle the logs and the ingress, the current implementation is opinionated for ngnix (for spark ui) and lokki, while both are widely adopted, how can someone with another ingress controller use their own (withouth modifying your code)? I understand the log might be a bit more challenging to provide the native UI integration, in that case maybe offer the possibility to use a sidecar for log shipping?\r\n\r\nFor livy there is a block that look up for the `hostname`, this does not play well with containers/k8s world. Would it be possible to make it more k8s native to work with a service, this would mean we might need to pass a `svc` as ENV variable.
