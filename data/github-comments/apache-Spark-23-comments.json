your more general remarks @srowen:\n\nI think those are valid concerns, here is my reasoning for doing it this way:\nThe predict function returns the label, but I need the predicted \"score\" or predicted probability (in case of LR) of the test samples in order to sort them.\n\nAlso, in more generality, this seems like a useful function to have. I do not want to change the predict function, since that is what is probably most used and wanted, and it would be annoying to change the score into a label by hand, and only in the binary classification setting.\n\nHowever, this score function only makes sense in the binary classification setting, and so does ROC AUC. Later I hope to add the PR AUC as well, and that can be added to the same class, but first things first.\n\nThe alternative is to define this function for both LR and SVM separately, but I don't like that either.\n\nHowever, I do agree it is not the most clean code, so your suggestions are very welcome.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38003806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38005375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/165#issuecomment-38005375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/165","id":38005375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDA1Mzc1","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-19T00:21:37Z","updated_at":"2014-03-19T00:21:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me too.
