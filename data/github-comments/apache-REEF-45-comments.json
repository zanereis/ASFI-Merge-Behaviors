Its configuration is inherited from `reef-project`'s pom file. Just try to violate some check from standard set of checks, for example, add a line over 120 characters long to one of the files in Wake, and it will dutifully fail build due to checkstyle violation. `maven-checkstyle-plugin` is present in subprojects which are using `checkstyle-strict.xml` configuration instead of standard one, but it contains `DiamondOperatorForVariableDefinition`. However, there might be some weird configuration issue related to use of check which is not part of standard checks set.\n\nI don't really like cloning checkstyle settings for each combination of issues we've fixed, as this makes adding new checks harder.

As far as I understand, the intent is to expose the current status of a Driver to the client. This Driver may still be running or already shut down, which complicates matters. \n\nA straight forward way to do this to me is this:\n- Change `SubmitAndGetDriverUrl` to `SubmitAndGetJobStatus` which returns an `IDriverHandle`\n- Add `IDriverHandle GetDriverHandle(string appId)` to `IREEFClient`.\n\nThe `IDriverHandle` represents the running or completed Driver. It has the following structure:\n\n```\npublic interface IDriverHandle{\n  // Can return `null` when the Driver is no longer running.\n  Uri DriverUri(get;);\n  string AppId{get;}\n  state State{get;}\n}\n```\n\nThat way, we can unify the APIs for when the job is running with the APIs for when it is done. In the latter case, a user can call `IREEFClient.GetDriverHandle` to get the status of the job.\n\nAlso, this might get us closer to the API @anupam128 is working on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/153127240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/153145760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/594#issuecomment-153145760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/594","id":153145760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzE0NTc2MA==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-02T20:21:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T20:21:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree the name change, make them readable: \nChange SubmitAndGetDriverUrl to SubmitAndGetJobStatus\nchange IDriverHttpEndpoint to IDriverHandle\nSubmitAndGetJobStatus returns IDriverHandle just like SubmitAndGetDriverUrl  returns IDriverHttpEndpoint \n\nInside IDriverHandle, DriverUri and AppId are unchanged once the Job is submitted.

Is it possible use one `JOB_SUBMISSION_DIRECTORY` for both classes? Otherwise, we should make another `YARN_JOB_SUMBISSION_DIRECTORY` and change all the code with `.set(YarnDriverConfiguration.JOB_SUBMISSION_DIRECTORY, jobSubmissionFolder)`\n\n```\npublic class YarnDriverConfiguration extends ConfigurationModuleBuilder {\n  public static final ConfigurationModule CONF = new YarnDriverConfiguration()\n    .bindNamedParameter(org.apache.reef.driver.parameters.JobSubmissionDirectory.class, JOB_SUBMISSION_DIRECTORY)\n     .bindNamedParameter(org.apache.reef.runtime.yarn.driver.parameters.JobSubmissionDirectory.class, JOB_SUBMISSION_DIRECTORY)\n```\n- Second, in Tang injection, we can not declare two different injectors distinguished by `@Parameter` annotation. How can we handle this in Tang world elegantly? Could you give some advice for this kind of transition?\n\n```\n/**\n * @deprecated in 0.14\n */\n@Inject\nUploaderToJobFolder(@Parameter(org.apache.reef.driver.parameters.JobSubmissionDirectory.class) final String jobSubmissionDirectory,\n                    final YarnConfiguration yarnConfiguration) throws IOException {\n  this.jobSubmissionDirectory = jobSubmissionDirectory;\n  this.fileSystem = FileSystem.get(yarnConfiguration);\n}\n\n@Inject\nUploaderToJobFolder(@Parameter(org.apache.reef.runtime.yarn.driver.parameters.JobSubmissionDirectory.class) final String jobSubmissionDirectory,\n                      final YarnConfiguration yarnConfiguration) throws IOException {\n  this.jobSubmissionDirectory = jobSubmissionDirectory;\n  this.fileSystem = FileSystem.get(yarnConfiguration);\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/153205261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/153207896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/582#issuecomment-153207896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/582","id":153207896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzIwNzg5Ng==","user":{"login":"jwang98052","id":5666504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5666504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052","html_url":"https://github.com/jwang98052","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwang98052/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T00:58:04Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T00:58:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will test and merge if there is not objection.
