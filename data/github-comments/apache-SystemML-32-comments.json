`systemml-spark-submit.py` and `systemml-standalone.py`. (Common functions like `get_env`, `default_jars`, `find_script_file` etc...)\r\nb) Change `systemml-standalone.py` to point `jars` instead of `classes`.\r\n\r\nI have tested `systemml-spark-submit.py`

we should definitely merge this functionality.  Is everyone okay with the updated names of `DRIVER` instead of `SINGLE_NODE`, and `DRIVER_AND_SPARK` instead of `HYBRID_SPARK`?  To me they are clearer, but it does introduce inconsistencies.  cc @nakul02","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/315852777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/315852880","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/499#issuecomment-315852880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/499","id":315852880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTg1Mjg4MA==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T19:12:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T19:12:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can this be updated now?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/315852880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/315856803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/497#issuecomment-315856803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/497","id":315856803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTg1NjgwMw==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-17T19:28:10Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T19:28:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW the MLContext API naming differences vs the 'internal' global rtplatform in DMLScript are:\r\nDMLScript.RUNTIME_PLATFORM.SINGLE_NODE -> ExecutionType.DRIVER\r\nDMLScript.RUNTIME_PLATFORM.SPARK -> ExecutionType.SPARK\r\nDMLScript.RUNTIME_PLATFORM.HADOOP -> ExecutionType.HADOOP\r\nDMLScript.RUNTIME_PLATFORM.HYBRID_SPARK -> ExecutionType.DRIVER_AND_SPARK\r\nDMLScript.RUNTIME_PLATFORM.HYBRID -> ExecutionType.DRIVER_AND_HADOOP\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for this:\r\nSINGLE_NODE is confusing since SystemML can run in CP on a single node, Spark can run on a single node, and Hadoop can run on a single node.\r\nHYBRID is CP+Hadoop, whereas HYBRID_SPARK is CP+Spark.

original intent of these modes was to specify what kind of runtime instructions can be generated. It was primarily internally. Later with different SystemML deployment modes, the same “flag” was used for the user to be able to specify the deployment mode.\r\n\r\nFrom user’s perspective, there are 2 or 3 modes depending on how you count: no use of a data parallel platform, i.e. single node, or use of data parallel platform, i.e. MR, or Spark. Yes, you can run MR and Spark on single node, but from SystemML perspective it is still using a data parallel platform.\r\n\r\nIf people don’t like to use “CP”, or “DRIVER”, or “SINGLE_NODE”, may be “LOCAL” is a better choice. I think using “HYBRID …” is very descriptive and important for SystemML.\r\n\r\nThere should be 3 modes exposed to the user:\r\n(1) LOCAL\r\n(2) HYBRID_MR\r\n(3) HYBRID_SPARK\r\n\r\nInternally, we should not get rid of SPARK and MR modes as they are being used for experimentation, debugging, and developing forcing all ops to SPARPK or MR. But they are useless to the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316291863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/316305847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/581#issuecomment-316305847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/581","id":316305847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjMwNTg0Nw==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-19T08:07:29Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T08:07:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer
