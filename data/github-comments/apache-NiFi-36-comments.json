Just a couple general comments...\n\nI'm not sure we want to include all the System/Java version details in the about dialog. The `AboutDTO` which had these items added will be available for any user who has permissions to access the UI. I have concern allowing all users who can access the UI to know the server's OS/architecture/version and what vendor/version of Java is running. Including these items in the System Diagnostics is good IMO as users need to be granted explicit permission for viewing system level details.\n\nLeaving the build details in the About Dialog is good IMO. I would suggest that we use the `DateTimeAdapter` on the build timestamp field to be consistent with other timestamps rendered throughout the UI. Since these only add a couple rows, it may make sense to remove the toggle and make the dialog a little bit taller.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255138567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255146348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1087#issuecomment-255146348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1087","id":255146348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTE0NjM0OA==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T15:50:11Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T15:50:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255146348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255160191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1073#issuecomment-255160191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1073","id":255160191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTE2MDE5MQ==","user":{"login":"paulgibeault","id":21108543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTA4NTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21108543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault","html_url":"https://github.com/paulgibeault","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgibeault/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T16:39:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T16:39:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I accidentally polluted this branch.

I have seen it couple of times, that Java developers tend to set the charset (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/31644153). It is mainly because Java writers let those methods like String.getBytes() to behave not statically -> said in documentation it will return always UTF-8 transformation to bytes, but these argless functions behave 'system-dependent' way - Java tries to figure out the Locale on the system it is running... you know. It causes o lot of headaches, mainly for Java newbies.\nBut if NiFi is coded properly, and every such function call is used only in argument-aware version, default charset is not even used inside JVM at runtime, nobody simply ask for it by calling Charset.defaultCharset or String.getBytes or other Java gotchas String>byte manipulation function.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255204314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255222937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/961#issuecomment-255222937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/961","id":255222937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTIyMjkzNw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T20:45:07Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T20:45:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

After some discussions with Alluxio folks, it seems that there are some limitations at the moment (v1.3.0) and I've made some modifications to take into account those limitations.\n\n### System properties\n\nAt the moment, it seems it is not possible to initialize the Alluxio client inside NiFi without using system properties. And in any case, multi Alluxio clusters handling is not supported at the moment.\n\n### Initialization\n\nOnce the client is initialized, it cannot be unchanged unless NiFi is restarted. Even if provided IP/port are incorrect, the client initialization will not do any check. To avoid mistakes, I've added a simple check to ensure that something is listening at IP/port before initializing the client.\n_Improvement on Alluxio's side is tracked here: https://alluxio.atlassian.net/browse/ALLUXIO-2120_\n\nI've updated processors description to note it as **experimental** and let the users know what are the current limitations. Hopefully, this won't be a show stopper to get this first version into NiFi and get feedbacks from the community.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255706525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255739837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1150#issuecomment-255739837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1150","id":255739837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTczOTgzNw==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-24T13:27:08Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T13:27:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255739837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/255754090","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1018#issuecomment-255754090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1018","id":255754090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTc1NDA5MA==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-24T14:21:03Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T14:21:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, great addition here, thanks!

For me, what is odd is the fact that the initial preview is not an accurate view of the current state of the processor. I feel like an initial color should not be selected and either the preview is empty or it shows the default processor. The preview would change once the user selects a color. Overall it's a trivial concern and could be addressed later; I don't think the current interaction will confuse anyone.\n\nI like the color change of the label value text, but the label preview is using a gradient and the border color changes as well. To be accurate I would suggest using the solid color and keep the border gray (`rgba(0,0,0,0.25`). I'd also suggest updating the text in the label preview to say \"Label Value\" instead of only \"Label.\" This aligns with the wording seen when you _configure_ the label to enter text.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/256331037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/256353139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1016#issuecomment-256353139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1016","id":256353139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjM1MzEzOQ==","user":{"login":"brianburnett","id":22099886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDk5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22099886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett","html_url":"https://github.com/brianburnett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianburnett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T13:50:11Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T13:50:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think that the commit is now amended correctly - possible to verify?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/256353139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/256355434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1016#issuecomment-256355434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1016","id":256355434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjM1NTQzNA==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-26T13:57:46Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T13:57:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems fixed.

I had a chance to check out the update. Everything looks good but I do have one other comment that I probably should have noticed before. Given the build details ultimately come from `nifi.properties` I don't think we can rely on their presence. Often times, folks upgrade by retaining their consisting `conf` directory so we typically try to ensure things still work when the properties do not exist. In the System Diagnostics, it probably makes sense to simply populate the fields with a message indicating that the value isn't set. Additionally, you can style the elements with `unset`. In the About dialog is probably makes sense to just not render anything under the version.

We just released version 1.0.0 so we don't have another major release scheduled in the immediate future. We could certainly look to update the endpoints to return these new values in addition to the existing ones (which could then be marked as deprecated). Or we could investigate a means for versioning the API so that existing clients wouldn't break and new clients could utilize the new endpoints. Though it may make sense to do this work when we add i18n support throughout the application which will likely require either a major NiFi version change or supporting multiple versions of the REST API concurrently.\n\nRegardless what additional work we identify here, I believe the work that was discussed with @simplesteph needs to happen as the documentation is currently misreporting the actual data type of these fields.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/256915078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257133099","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1136#issuecomment-257133099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1136","id":257133099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzEzMzA5OQ==","user":{"login":"simplesteph","id":20851561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUxNTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20851561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph","html_url":"https://github.com/simplesteph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplesteph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-30T05:30:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-30T05:30:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry I haven't had the time to work on it just yet...

What I am trying to say is the fact that property values can be changed multiple times per single instance of the component and while it's ok for most properties, changing values for things like additional classpath will most likely result in unpredictable type resolution exceptions.\nFor example; If a JAR provided as property value is changed after a component already had a chance to run and certain classes were already loaded from the previous JAR while new versions (compatible or not) of the same classes are coming with the new JAR.\n\nAlternatively, we can take a slightly different approach and address it similarly to the way it is addressed in SpringContextProcessor where additional classpath has no relation to the instance of the component and only exists while component is in active state (e.g., CS-enabled, Proc-started, etc.)\n\nTo summarize; we either have to document the limitations and side-effects of the per-instance approach or change it to per-activation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257873730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257911107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1166#issuecomment-257911107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1166","id":257911107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzkxMTEwNw==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T16:03:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T16:03:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing. . .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257911107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257914602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1163#issuecomment-257914602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1163","id":257914602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzkxNDYwMg==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T16:14:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T16:14:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257914602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257915300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1047#issuecomment-257915300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1047","id":257915300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzkxNTMwMA==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T16:17:01Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T16:17:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@trixpan please make sure that commit log entries indicate/start with the JIRA.\n\nThis would be in this case\n\nNIFI-2812 This closes #1047.
