I'm having trouble with the deactivate/activate commands, as the Tmaster is behind a firewall and it seems like that command has to talk directly with Tmaster (I think?). I got a docker image for the tools package built so I got the Tracker API and the Heron UI up and running on DC/OS correctly. I'm working on bundling that into a legit DC/OS universe package where DCOS users can just do `dcos package install heron`. So, things I have outstanding here are:\r\n - Fix remaining failing test\r\n - Make changes that were suggested on the reviews above (small code changes, verify the 'HOST' variable)\r\n - Add my Dockerfiles for the executor to the project\r\n - Add Dockerfiles used for API tracker and Heron UI deployment\r\n - Figure out where to put DC/OS package information\r\n - Add a configuration in the marathon scheduler for Auth token (most clusters use JWT-based authentication)\r\n - Figure out how to get around activate/deactivate command issues behind a firewall\r\n - Add some documentation for getting marathon scheduler running against a dc/os scheduler\r\n\r\nThis is what I think I have left to do.

This situation becomes more common when you don't close your ZooKeeper session explicitly when you shut down your service, so you're relying on the ZooKeeper server quorum itself to expire ephemeral nodes.
