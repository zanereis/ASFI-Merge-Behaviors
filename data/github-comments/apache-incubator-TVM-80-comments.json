I'll take another pass later this week to iron out those TODOs in the PR body.\r\n\r\n> Ichange runtime packed function representation to the optimum one.\r\n\r\nJust pushed a fix to that (https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2616/commits/3d10c6bd21f3dd5c7eb7c0c8bab7f2393843cfb6). Note that the fat pointer is required if you want to make a `PackedFunc` out of a closure. Otherwise, it's probably sufficient to `from_raw` a C function pointer so to prevent allocation. It shouldn't matter w.r.t. the UI since `Box<T>` is `Deref<T>`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/465675334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/465683718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2609#issuecomment-465683718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2609","id":465683718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTY4MzcxOA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T17:47:17Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T17:47:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, @yidawang @zhiics @eqy @yzhliu .
