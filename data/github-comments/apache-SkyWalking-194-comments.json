Whether all implementations of MQTT would be traced if we have this plugin?\r\n> \r\n> Also, note, there are MQs like ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ, which we have plugins already. What will happen we have both plugins in the runtime?\r\n\r\n1. The goal of the plug-in is to provide the corresponding tracking for the implementers who are using the mqtt protocol. If we have this plug-in, the plug-ins that communicate with the mqtt broker through eclipse PAHO will be tracked. For example, eclipse PAHO client publish message to broker and client consumer message, and then process the user's business logic can be traced, as shown in the following figure:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11907624/96988039-64f3c480-1556-11eb-97fe-17bd49954723.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11907624/96988249-ab492380-1556-11eb-9bab-d371cb33282b.png)\r\n\r\n2. If we have other MQ plug-ins and add mqtt plug-ins to run at the same time, there will be no problem. They are independent of each other, as shown in the following

Sorry, I am far from understanding what mqtt did.\r\n\r\nRabbitmq itself also supports the mqtt protocol, but it needs to be introduced as a plug-in, which is relatively complex. At present, we have independently deployed the mqtt broker for link tracking. In the IOT business scenario, this deployment method is more common. Of course, if rabbitmq installs the mqtt plug-in, it will not have the problem of tracking links now. Because our mqtt plugin enhances and tracks the mqtt client (eclipse PAHO) of Java, there is no coexistence problem.\r\n\r\nTest scenarios:\r\nIf mqtt broker is rabbitmq, mqtt client is eclipse PAHO, then the topology is as follows:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11907624/97149948-64eb0300-17a8-11eb-966f-caf925317a34.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11907624/97149671-09b91080-17a8-11eb-8875-116387c51972.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/716375827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/716394724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5694#issuecomment-716394724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5694","id":716394724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjM5NDcyNA==","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-26T08:30:27Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T08:30:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @kezhenxu94\r\n> I need some help, 'mqtt plugin' always fails in testing 'plugin test'. `expectedData.yaml`How to write it?
