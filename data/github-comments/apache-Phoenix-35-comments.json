Lack of a CBO framework in Phoenix, seems that it is sensible to be conservative, I think it is better to left whether or not select this strategy to user by user specifying the Index Hint just as the existing code.\r\n\r\n@comnetwork @lhofhansl, I have updated the PR such that the uncovered global indexes will be used only when the index hint is provided as @comnetwork suggested.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1023603041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1025375583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1377#issuecomment-1025375583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1377","id":1025375583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs49Hf1f","user":{"login":"stoty","id":304757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty","html_url":"https://github.com/stoty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stoty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-31T04:40:44Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T04:40:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We already have b4697afc3f23ca29ddd87c8708097cd68f91286d for the same issue on master/5.1 that includes tests changes as well.\r\nI think we'd better backport that one.

There is also a significant cost to seeking (even when done locally)\r\n> \r\n> In fact the only difference might be how we get the a table reference.\r\n\r\n@lhofhansl, we can definitely do this for local indexes. There are some differences. The first is as you pointed out table vs region. For local indexes, both data and index are accessed via the local region while the global index is accessed remotely so we need to get the table for the global index and then get connections to access the table. The concern of which connection pool to use is not applicable to the local index.  The second difference is that there is one table region to retrieve data rows for the local index. However, for the global index, there can be many. So we discover the table region boundaries and access them in parallel for the global indexes using a thread pool, which is not necessary for the local index. The last difference is handling the row key offset for local indexes, which is not necessary for the global indexes. So, I thought instead of lumping local and global index batching together, we should handle them separately. I suggest having a separate Jira and PR for the local index.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1059669953/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1067364369","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1402#issuecomment-1067364369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1402","id":1067364369,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs4_nrAR","user":{"login":"gokceni","id":47044859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDQ0ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47044859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni","html_url":"https://github.com/gokceni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-14T22:27:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T22:27:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1067364369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1069413287","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1397#issuecomment-1069413287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1397","id":1069413287,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs4_vfOn","user":{"login":"gokceni","id":47044859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDQ0ODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47044859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni","html_url":"https://github.com/gokceni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gokceni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-16T18:20:45Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T18:20:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1069413287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/1073067481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/1405#issuecomment-1073067481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/1405","id":1073067481,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAThmSs4_9bXZ","user":{"login":"lhofhansl","id":446130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjEzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/446130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl","html_url":"https://github.com/lhofhansl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhofhansl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-19T19:21:04Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T21:59:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems that I cannot look at the output of the test run...?\r\n\r\nUpdate: I can now.
