Is it possible?\r\n\r\nSounds cool to me. I think we may abstract a python kind task, so that all specific kinds of python related tasks could extend it, as well as all its approaches to manage python environments. Currently, the three approaches of python env management are experimental. I  suggest we only put them in jupyter task first and see what feedback we could get from users. If positive, we may take the next step and abstract the python kind task mentioned above.\r\n\r\nWDYT @zhongjiajie ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1172014440/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1172047803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10658#issuecomment-1172047803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10658","id":1172047803,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5F3Ae7","user":{"login":"EricGao888","id":34905992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTA1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34905992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888","html_url":"https://github.com/EricGao888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-01T07:49:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-01T07:49:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW, although I  stick to using `conda`, `venv` looks pretty light-weighted and do not need users to install `Anaconda` manually.
