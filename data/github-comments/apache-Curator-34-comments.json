The Compatibility class checks for a well-known 3.5 class and sets a static<br/>\n    that advertises whether the ZK lib is 3.4.x or 3.5.x. Then, the code \"ifs\" using this static. The major work was emulating<br/>\n    the kill session injection (that emulation is done using reflection) and testing. The curator-test-zk module runs<br/>\n    the framework and recipe tests but forces ZooKeeper 3.4.x and uses the Curator 2.x version of curator-test. This<br/>\n    requires a few tricks as the new code uses new methods/classes on the Curator 3.x version of curator-test. I'll write<br/>\n    a readme documenting how this is done.</p>\n\n<p>commit 242b7011a7b8344f772c1a4497aadf6de16d73f5<br/>\nAuthor: randgalt <randgalt@apache.org><br/>\nDate:   2017-07-20T07:14:10Z</p>\n\n<p>    Use the resource plugin to copy the compatibility files instead of adding the source directory.

Our DNS server was temporarily down and Curator stopped retrying to connect because ZooKepper threw a non-retryable exception: (<tt>UnknownHostException</tt>). In ZooKepper >= 3.4.11 it will throw an <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>. This behaviour has changed as a result of these:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1576\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1576</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2614\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2614</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>What we've ended up doing is to register a custom <tt>ZookeeperFactory</tt> with<br/>\n<tt>CuratorFrameworkFactory.builder()</tt>. That factory is responsible for creating new <tt>ZooKeeper</tt> instances when retrying. So we're just catching <tt>UnknownHostException</tt> and <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt> there and then throw a <tt>ConnectionLossException</tt>, which is retry-able as far as Curator is concerned.</p>\n\n<p>In case anyone's interested, here's the code, in Scala:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-style: solid;border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeHeader panelHeader\" style=\"border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-style: solid;\"><b>ZookeeperFactory.scala</b></div><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\"><span class=\"code-keyword\">import</span> java.net.UnknownHostException\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">import</span> com.typesafe.scalalogging.LazyLogging\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">import</span> org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.ConnectionLossException\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">import</span> org.apache.zookeeper.{Watcher, ZooKeeper}\n\n/** ZooKeeper client factory that's resilient to hostname lookup errors.\n  *\n  * The purpose of <span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span> wrapper is to handle hostname errors encountered\n  * <span class=\"code-keyword\">while</span> creating ZooKeeper client instances.

watcher implements.</p>\n\n<p>As result,  when session closed, EventThread maybe fall into retry infinite loop in custom watcher, and no any chance to give curator's watcher &#8212; `ConnectionState#process` to handleExpiredSession and make `ClientCnxn#state` alive again(which is needed to break infinite loop).</p>\n\n<p>This problem can be solve if  we don't modify zookeeper/curator:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>not use forever retry policy..and infinite loop for \"a while\" - -</li>\n\t<li>or like `PathCache` does, send task to another thread after receive WatchedEvent</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>but I think it seems a hole that user defined watcher may block framework watcher, but framework watcher  is vital to user's watcher finish work..</p>\n\n<p>Is any ideal curator can do to improve this problem ^ ^?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604744563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604761720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/950#issuecomment-2604761720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/950","id":2604761720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NjE3MjA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-24T20:56:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:37:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

While DNS outages might be rare in classical deployment scenarios, they are much more likely in Docker-based environments: Docker containers can be given DNS names, but this name is only resolvable once the containers is actually started. During startup of our stack, often not all Zookeeper containers of our cluster are started yet (because fixing a certain startup order is hard to do and an anti-pattern anyway), but some Zookeeper clients containing curator are already starting up, trying to connect to the ensemble, and failing due to UnknownHostException (which, as was already mentioned below, is not even thrown but a background exception, making it even more convoluted to do one's own retry loop).</p>\n\n<p>So (maybe optionally)= making a DNS lookup error (UnknownHostException) a retryable error (not only during curator startup, but also during failover situations when Curator/ZookeeperClient switches from one Zookeeper instance that failed to another of the zookeeper connect string) would be really helpful here.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604727611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604762947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/959#issuecomment-2604762947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/959","id":2604762947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NjI5NDc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-25T08:45:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:38:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kenco\">kenco</a>:</i>\n<p>From analysing the log files, it looks like the ConnectionState fluctuated between SUSPENDED and RECONNECTED a few times, and was LOST twice.

However, this can hurt performance terribly if background operations are queued, for example, prior to initial connection. This changes the behavior so that the sleeps are cleared when the connection is re-established. A separate queue of \"forced sleep\" operations are kept while the connection is down. This queue then gets its sleep cleared when the connection is re-established.</p>\n\n<p>    Reviewers - please verify this logic. I think I have it right. I'm only concerned that I might be leaking operations into `forcedSleepOperations` that never get cleared.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-443\" title=\"Sleep too long when connection to zookeeper has not been established yet after construction\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-443\"><del>CURATOR-443</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/242.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/242.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #242</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit bfdb790bc69022b0eef74558e9511e6ed2b665e9<br/>\nAuthor: randgalt <randgalt@apache.org><br/>\nDate:   2017-11-22T02:11:01Z</p>\n\n<p>    To avoid massive spinning, background operations are paused for 1 second when there is no connection. However, this can hurt performance terribly if background operations are queued, for example, prior to initial connection. This changes the behavior so that the sleeps are cleared when the connection is re-established. A separate queue of \"forced sleep\" operations are kept while the connection is down. This queue then gets its sleep cleared when the connection is re-established.</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604763500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/346225712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/242#issuecomment-346225712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/242","id":346225712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjIyNTcxMg==","user":{"login":"Randgalt","id":264818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDgxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/264818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt","html_url":"https://github.com/Randgalt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Randgalt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-22T02:36:43Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T02:36:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I added another change to remove slept operations from the DelayQueue and re-add to force a resort.
