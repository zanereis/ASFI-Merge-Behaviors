Would it better to have a separation within TaskModel instead of conflating SSPs into both inputs & side inputs? Doing so, will eliminate yet another hack addition to `TaskContextImpl` and potentially solve scenarios that require this divide information upstream. Checking if you have evaluated this option and what the initial thoughts are.\r\n\r\nI didn't really consider changing the `TaskModel`. My initial thoughts are that if we think it is useful for the general `TaskModel` API to separate out the side inputs (for use by actual applications), then that could help the implementation here. However, if this won't be helpful for the general API, then I don't think we should bloat/modify the API just to fix this issue (for backwards compat, we probably would need to add a new field and not modify the current one). I'm not currently convinced that this is useful enough for the general API, so I don't think that we should change the general API for this bug fix. What do you think?\r\nI think the root reason for why we need this `TaskContextImpl` hack is because we don't have a clean way to wire in internal components for the high-level implementation (e.g. we also need the `TaskContextImpl` hack to wire through `StreamMetadataCache` into high-level). I don't see a clean way to fix this root reason right now though.\r\n\r\n> 3. Looks like fix for SAMZA-2300 is going in as part of this PR. Why is that? Can we separate it into another PR to keep the scope of the PR to single issue?\r\n\r\nAnswering #3 first: In order to test the side inputs fix (i.e. `TestLocalTableWithSideInputsEndToEnd`), I needed to modify existing tests to use multiple partitions. The current tests (only single partition) don't rely on the end-of-stream propagation. This is why we didn't recognize this bug with the current tests. However, when I switch to using multiple partitions, then the bug in SAMZA-2300 gets triggered. So it was not ideal to split them up. I also don't think it is ideal to fix both tickets in the same commit (since it makes the single commit more complex), but I felt that the benefit towards having more complete tests for the side inputs fix (by merging into a single commit) was better. \r\n\r\n> 2. Can we separate out the tests into two categories (one that needs to belong as part of the fix vs one that isn't) and have a separate PR for the latter category of tests?\r\n\r\nI believe the only test changes that aren't as directly related to the side inputs fix is `TestLocalTableEndToEnd`. However, it does help add confidence that the SAMZA-2300 change is working as expected, so that is why I included the changes to `TestLocalTableEndToEnd` here. I do have another set of changes for migrating other tests which I did keep separate (I will post a PR for those when this one is done), but I wanted to at least have this one test in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/869951777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/869976157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1506#issuecomment-869976157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1506","id":869976157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTk3NjE1Nw==","user":{"login":"mynameborat","id":46942335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTQyMzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46942335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat","html_url":"https://github.com/mynameborat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameborat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-28T19:41:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T19:41:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> My initial thoughts are that if we think it is useful for the general TaskModel API to separate out the side inputs (for use by actual applications), then that could help the implementation here\r\n\r\nThat is one of the benefits of having the divide exposed in the TaskModel.

What do others think?\r\n\r\nThe state restore changes would indirectly benefit from having the sideinputs SSPs separated for the main SSPs in the task model since ContainerStorageManager would be simplified if that where the case. Currently CSM also does much of the config parsing to determine the store names/SSPs of the sideinputs. This would be a good step to simplify the overloaded CSM implementation. Adding it to the task model maybe help the specific impls of restore manager layer with multiple implementations to decide whether they want to restore for side input topics, but currently that is not used in Blob or changelog restore.\r\nNote that all of this for parsing and side input handlers initiation is happening in the CSM constructor, meaning that the TaskInstance is not yet created at the time and therefore the TaskContext is not instantiated either. CSM could only use that TaskModel currently. In general I think this side input info could live in task model as well from the perspective of simplifying CSM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/871746930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/comments/871754032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1506#issuecomment-871754032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1506","id":871754032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTc1NDAzMg==","user":{"login":"cameronlee314","id":37879374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODc5Mzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37879374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314","html_url":"https://github.com/cameronlee314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameronlee314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-30T21:58:22Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T21:58:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IMO, if we decide to add side inputs to `TaskModel`, it should primarily be because we think it is useful as a user API (and I think it does make sense to add to `TaskModel` because side inputs are external I/O as well).

Also, if there is an external caller of `ContainerLaunchUtil.run` (e.g. Beam), then any logs from that external caller which happen before `ContainerLaunchUtil.run` is called will be missed.

flow you mentioned above is only on the standalone path, and it isn't affected by this PR. Do you think I should also change `getJobCoordinationUtilsFactoryClassName` to check for `job.coordinator.factory` being the empty string?\r\n\r\nThis PR just covers `getOptionalJobCoordinatorFactoryClassName`, which is only used in `JobCoordinatorLaunchUtil` (which is only used by YARN). The challenge with having `getJobCoordinatorFactoryClassName` return `ClusterBasedJobCoordinator` is that we need to be returning a factory for the `ClusterBasedJobCoordinator` and `ClusterBasedJobCoordinator` doesn't implement `JobCoordinator`.
