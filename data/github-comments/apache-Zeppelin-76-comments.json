(In case some thing like this happens again). \n\nWhen I rebased, some version of ZeppelinClusterTest.java that had the [PySpark tests commented out](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/928/commits/d5963a9844ea9765ff2a34c5bcaf19f05a42d837#diff-64a9440e811c5fba6ac1b61157fa6912L121) got worked in, so of course it passed, the failing tests were skipped. \n\nHowever, I also happened to notice [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/928/commits/d5963a9844ea9765ff2a34c5bcaf19f05a42d837#diff-69b17249ac9d265091d730130d973f4aR493) that `org.apache.zeppelin.mahout.MahoutSparkInterpreter` was listed before `org.apache.zeppelin.spark.PySparkInterpreter` so I move the Mahout one down, and the tests seem to be passing now.  \n\n~~~This led me to believe, that is a very fragile test that should be looked into, but then I also realized I forgot to put a comma after the MahoutSparkInterpreter, so I'm going to do that now, and I'll bet what was happening, when it made the cluster: it didn't know how to make the pySpark or any of the other interpreters because of the missing comma, so mystery solved.~~~   I'm looking at it again, it seems there was a comma all along, so very strange.  Hard to say if it was the refactor or the reordering that did it. \n\nThanks for all of your help/sorry for wasting your time... I owe you both beers next time we're in the same spot. \n\n[Passing build after rearranging order of interpreters](https://travis-ci.org/apache/zeppelin/builds/148035751)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/235906635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/235908644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1239#issuecomment-235908644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1239","id":235908644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTkwODY0NA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-28T14:19:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-28T14:19:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the fix.
