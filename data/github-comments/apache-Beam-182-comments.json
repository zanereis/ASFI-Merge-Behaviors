(overhead of doing ``invoker.invoke_process()`` instead of ``process()``). To remove this overhead we'll have to remove modularity of invocation logic introduced by this CL. I don't think the amount of overhead observed in Robert's benchmark (0.1 sec per 10k invocations of process() method) justify totally removing modularity/structure of our DoFn invocation logic.

We can upgrade at our own pace and can always promise that beam head is stable.\r\n\r\n2. Having really strict version pinning makes it hard for users of Beam to always make sure they are using the same versions of the library. So if a user was already using a higher version than us for a library that made safe changes, it'll be annoying for them but I guess if we generally stay up to date with latest versions very few ppl will have that issue.\r\nMight be worthwhile exploring some sort of version-eye style system to make sure we're upgrading on time.
