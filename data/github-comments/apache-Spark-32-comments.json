what @CodingCat said, I think this solution has the same problem that I mentioned in response to your design posted in the JIRA (https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-1141).  Often, when the cluster is busy, resourceOffer() gets called with just one machine at a time (because all of the machines are busy, and then a single task finished, so resourceOffer() is called for the slot that the task just freed up).  With your solution, in that case, the serialization won't be asynchronous: one of the task set managers will accept the resource offer, and then the DAGScheduler will block waiting for the serialization to finish.  \n\nI think ideally what we'd like here is something similar to TaskResultGetter, which is also used by

One thing not noted here is that one of the APIs in\nthe hash maps, add(), has also been deprecated and is not available in\nnewer versions, and was being used to Spark, so it caused difficulties if\nnewer version of fastutil is used.  This might have been removed from Spark\ncode however.\n\n6.5.12\n- Removed some useless wrapper creation in a few methods of tree-based map\n  classes.\n- Fixed pathological maxFill computation for very small-sized big open\n  hash sets.\n\n6.5.11\n- A very old and subtle performance bug in hash-based data structures has\n  been fixed. Backing arrays were allocated using the number of expected\n  elements divided by the load factor. However, since the test for\n  rehashing was fired by equality with the table size multiplied by the\n  load factor, if the expected number of elements multiplied by the load\n  factor was an integer a useless rehash would happen for the very last\n  added element. The only effect was an useless increase in object\n  creation.\n\n6.5.10\n- Now iterators in object set constructors are of type Iterator, and not\n  anymore ObjectIterator. The kind of allowed iterators has been\n  rationalised and made uniform through all classes implementing Set.\n\n6.5.9\n- New methods to get a type-specific Iterable from binary or\n  text files.\n\n6.5.8\n- Fixed stupid bug in creation of array-based FIFO queues.\n\n6.5.7\n- Fixed a very subtle bug in hash-based data structures: addAll() to a\n  newly created structure could require a very long time due to\n  correlation between the positions in structures with different table\n  sizes.\n\n6.5.6\n- equals() method between arrays have been deprecated in favour of the\n  java.util.Arrays version, which is intrinsified in recent JVMs.\n- InspectableFileCachedInputStream.reopen() makes it possible to\n  read again from the start an instance on which close() was\n  invoked.\n\n6.5.5\n- The abstract implementation of equals() between (big) lists now uses\n  type-specific access methods (as the compareTo() method was already\n  doing) to avoid massive boxing/unboxing. Thanks to Adrien Grand for\n  suggesting this improvement.\n- FIFO array-based queues are now serializable.\n\n6.5.4\n- Further fixes related to NaNs in sorting.\n- Fixed very old bug in FastByteArrayOutputStream.write(int).\n  Thanks to Massimo Santini for reporting this bug.\n- We now use Arrays.MAX_ARRAY_SIZE, which is equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE\n  minus 8, to bound all array allocations. Previously, it might happen\n  that grow() and other array-related functions could try to allocate an\n  array of size Integer.MAX_VALUE, which is technically correct from the\n  JLS, but will not work on most JVMs. The maximum length we use now is\n  the same value as that used by java.util.ArrayList. Thanks to William\n  Harvey for suggesting this change.\n\n6.5.3\n- Corrected erroneous introduction of compare() methods on integral\n  classes (they appeared in Java 7).\n\n6.5.2\n- A few changes were necessary to make fastutil behave as Java on NaNs\n  when sorting. Double.compareTo() and Float.compareTo() treat Double.NaN\n  as greater than Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, and fastutil was not doing it.\n  As part of the change, now all comparisons between primitive types are\n  performed using the compare() method of the wrapper class\n  (microbenchmarks confirmed that there is no speed penalty for that,\n  probably due to inlining or even intrinsification). Thanks to Adam Klein\n  for reporting this bug.\n- All quickSort() implementations that do not involve a comparator are now\n  deprecated, as there are equivalent/better versions in java.util.Arrays.\n\n6.5.0 -> 6.5.1\n- Now FastBuffered{Input/Output}Stream has a constructor with an\n  explicitly given buffer.\n- Abandoned golden-ratio based expansion of arrays and lists in favour of\n  a (more standard) doubling approach.\n- Array-based FIFO queues now reduce their capacity automatically by\n  halving when the size becomes one fourth of the length.\n- The add() method for open hash maps has been deprecated and replaced by\n  addTo(), as the name choice proved to be a recipe for disaster.\n- New InspectableFileCachedInputStream for caching easily large byte\n  streams partially on file and partially in memory.\n- The front() method for semi-indirect heaps took no comparator, but\n  was used in queues in which you could support a comparator. There\n  is now a further version accepting a comparator.\n- Serial Version UIDs are now private.\n\n6.4.6 -> 6.5.0\n- Fixed type of array hash strategies.\n- Fixed use of equals() instead of compareTo() in\n  SemiIndirectHeaps.front(). Thanks to Matthew Hatem for reporting this\n  bug.\n- Now we generate custom hash maps for primite types, too (as we were\n  already doing for sets).\n\n6.4.5 -> 6.4.6\n- In array-based priority queues changed() would not invalidate\n  the cached index of the smallest element.\n\n6.4.4 -> 6.4.5\n- In some very rare circumstances, enumeration of hash sets or maps\n  combined with massive element removal (using the iterator remove()\n  method) could have led to inconsistent enumeration (duplicates and\n  missing elements). Thanks to Hamish Morgan for reporting this bug.\n\nOn Mon, Mar 24, 2014 at 11:19 AM, Aaron Davidson\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> What are the fixes to the OpenHashMaps?
