Although most of the implementation makes sense, it raises some questions about treating blanks strings as nulls. Although the `java.net.URI` has a number of constructors, it seems like this may provide more options than necessary. There is some value in simplicity, versus exposing all the possible options, which could also avoid potential confusion related to handling blank strings as nulls.\r\n> \r\n> The discussion on NIFI-10754 originated out of issues with the `urlEncode` function. If the implementation were to be scoped down to just something like `uriEncodePath`, for instance, would that provide the desired functionality?\r\n\r\n@exceptionfactory  If I understand you correctly that means there would have to be potentially at least 3 method calls when constructing a URI, one to urlEncodePath to encode the path, one to urlEncode to encode the parameters and one to concatenate all the strings necessary for creating the URI . I was actually intending to simplify that process of URI construction with one call which would take care of the encoding for both the path and the parameters and building the URI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1363956081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1364109162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6802#issuecomment-1364109162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6802","id":1364109162,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5RTqdq","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-23T16:46:47Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T16:46:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Why do we need to update nifi-resources.pom?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback @Lehel44.

It would take a bit more work, but it seems worth evaluating what it would take to support a literal `null` argument for `getUri`. It seems like it could be scoped to this function.\r\n\r\nFor `getUri` itself, there does not seem to be much value in the three-argument non-hierarchical option for `mailto` and similar links. This could be added later, but I think it makes more sense to focus on the hierarchical URI constructors unless you have a specific use case in mind for non-hierarchical URIs.\r\n\r\nFor hierarchical URIs, the four and five argument constructors appear to fall into the convenience category.

Although it is the most verbose, it provides the clearest implementation for documentation and usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1364267630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1364270877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6689#issuecomment-1364270877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6689","id":1364270877,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5RUR8d","user":{"login":"dan-s1","id":8440116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDAxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8440116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-s1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-s1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-23T19:40:31Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T19:40:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I am fine with only implementing the seven argument constructor.

This broke the contract of `LeaderElectionManager.getLeader()` which callers expected to return a `null` when there is no leader for the role requested. I updated `findLeader()` to return `Optional<String>`, and check the expiration of the Lease so that `findLeader` returns `Optional.empty()` when the Lease has expired. The expiration is determined based on `renewTime` plus `leaseDurationSeconds`, following the definition of those fields in the [Kubernetes LeaseSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/lease-v1/#LeaseSpec).\r\n\r\nTo make the implementation contract clearer, I also changed the return of `LeaderElectionManager.getLeader()` from `String` to `Optional<String>`. Although the method documentation noted that `null` indicates no leader is elected, changing the return to use `Optional` clarifies that detail without requiring too many adjustments. This seemed like a good time to make the change as part of promoting `LeaderElectionManager` to an extension component interface.\r\n\r\nFollowing those changes, shutting down all nodes, then starting up a single node that was not previously the Cluster Coordinator or Primary Node worked as expected. The single node was able to become the leader for those roles.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Lease objects continue to live in the Kubernetes namespace even if all nodes have been shutdown for an extended period. The `renewTime` indicates the last update, and the corrected logic will now update existing values as needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1373154084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1373204339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6416#issuecomment-1373204339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6416","id":1373204339,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5R2W9z","user":{"login":"lizhizhou","id":1780018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODAwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhizhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhizhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T06:41:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T06:41:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks for adding the `Time Field` property @lizhizhou.\r\n> \r\n> To simplify the final stages of the review, can you squash all changes into a single commit?

Do you anticipate any compatibility issues where a use case would work with Zookeeper but would not work with ConfigMaps?\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback @michael81877. The standard ZooKeeper node storage is also [limited to 1 MB](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.8.0/apidocs/zookeeper-server/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooKeeper.html#create-java.lang.String-byte:A-java.util.List-org.apache.zookeeper.CreateMode-), so the standard size limits of a Kubernetes ConfigMap align well with current behavior.\r\n\r\nWith that background and similar size limitations, I do not expect any compatibility issues based on size limitations. It is possible that other behavioral nuances could surface as a result of these alternative State Management and Leader Election implementations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1375670809/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1375740577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6831#issuecomment-1375740577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6831","id":1375740577,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5SACKh","user":{"login":"krisztina-zsihovszki","id":76993418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTkzNDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76993418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki","html_url":"https://github.com/krisztina-zsihovszki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krisztina-zsihovszki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-09T14:52:49Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T14:52:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"recheck","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1375740577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1375949842","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6581#issuecomment-1375949842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6581","id":1375949842,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5SA1QS","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-09T16:59:00Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T16:59:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Shoot I meant to do that but apparently forgot.

This would give me the option to potentially chain multiple instances together in a flow definition.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1397265977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1397446624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6770#issuecomment-1397446624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6770","id":1397446624,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5TS1fg","user":{"login":"NissimShiman","id":57680836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjgwODM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57680836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman","html_url":"https://github.com/NissimShiman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NissimShiman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-19T18:46:49Z","updated_at":"2023-01-19T18:46:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 Could you look at this and comment about whether there would be an issue if UpdateAttribute processor had an EL validator for non-stateful mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1397446624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1397536783","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6867#issuecomment-1397536783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6867","id":1397536783,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5TTLgP","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-19T20:09:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-19T20:09:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"very cool.
