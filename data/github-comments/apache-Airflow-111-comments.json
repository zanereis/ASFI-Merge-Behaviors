It looks like the the unnamed logger *must* use a console handler, or else the logging in DAG files are not preserved.\r\n\r\nfor example, this works:\r\n```\r\n        '': {\r\n            'handlers': ['console'],\r\n            'level': LOG_LEVEL,\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this doesn't:\r\n```\r\n        '': {\r\n            'handlers': ['file.task'],\r\n            'level': LOG_LEVEL,\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see how the console handler is working: the TaskRunner reads the stdout from the task thread and copy them to the 'airflow.task_runner' logger. \r\n\r\nWhen we configure the unnamed logger with  `airflow.task` FileTaskHandler, any logger created in the DAG file have not had their context set for the handler, therefore the underlying handler == None.\r\n\r\nThis comes across as a bit counter-intuitive to me, since the configurations do not directly reflect how the logs are handled.

But will all tasks in a DAG need to prepare the urls in advance? If yes, then it would be a problem, cause all operators might not have very simple logic as you have in the example. In the current form we are doing the same, but lazily. i.e. deciding how to make an url on the basis of which button was clicked.

The web server doesn’t need to do it for 100s of tasks, because it will only do it for the task/operator being displayed. That is just 1.\r\n\r\nI also think it doesn’t need to be a redirect, it can just be a link. @mistercrunch I’m not sure I understand your approach. If we launch a spark task we need to parse the output to get the right information to link directly to the relevant location. Thus there is a method involved in the operator that gives back dynamic information. And maybe stores this.\r\n\r\nWhat I am imagining is that the Operator stores some extra info in a Json field, we then use a static method from The Operator (derived from BaseOperator) that translates this information to a url and the web server can make that visible when it is matched a against a whitelist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/342801629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/342841509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2723#issuecomment-342841509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2723","id":342841509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Mjg0MTUwOQ==","user":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T14:54:18Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T14:54:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"-1 for the moment, I have encountered a bug when testing on our Kubernetes instance.

Airflow webserver prepares a json dump of the whole dag (i.e all tasks) and sends it to UI. When you click a node in UI, it just uses that json information to render the modal dialog.
