The new test fails without this fix. \n\nOverall there are quite a few changes to KafkaIOTest.java, much larger than I expected.\nWhile working on this I found an important problem with how I was using MockConsumer. When we seek() on a topic, it just changes topic metadata, but not what it serves. If we have 10 records, and we seek to the end, next `poll()` still returns those 10 records. It is our responsibility to feed the records correct based on partition position. Now fixed.\n\nBecause of this problem, existing checkpoint test was wrong (it passed by a fluke, the reader ignores records before the expected offset with a warning). This is also fixed now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/253149356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/253161440","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1073#issuecomment-253161440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1073","id":253161440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzE2MTQ0MA==","user":{"login":"amitsela","id":4245753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDU3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4245753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela","html_url":"https://github.com/amitsela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T09:16:03Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T09:16:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've used the `Aggregator` names from `PAssert`, but it doesn't seem like I can actually use any transformation there.\nI've also added an explicit flag for graceful stops, for most of the time tests should stop immediately or they will keep executing a couple of more micro-batches (streaming) and may fail when they shouldn't.\nFinally, I removed all calls to close() on batch tests because they weren't really needed -

This was mainly for the local runner (and to some extent Dataflow runner). There is quite a big ambiguity around 'How long should UnboundedSourceReader.advance()' wait. Ideally runner should work fine even if 'advance()' is always non-blocking.  There is minimal guidance from SDK on this.  E.g. originally I had both timeouts set to just 10 millis. It caused cpu thrashing on local runner (it kept churning through too many empty bundles, as start() often returned false). 5 seconds timeout for start() was mainly to address this problem. May be this is less of an issue now with DoFn reuse etc (cc @tgroh).\n\nI think 5 seconds is too long too. I am open making these configurable as work around. \nFrom spark runner perspective, how long should 'advance()' wait ideally when there is no input?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/253304606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/253308615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1083#issuecomment-253308615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1083","id":253308615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzMwODYxNQ==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-12T19:09:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T19:09:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have now updated the commits to further improve review and git performance.\n1.
