Placing the python/ruby/nodejs files in a JAR would require  npm install/pip install/gem install as part of the maven build and package the dynamic code with all of its dependnecies. It is too combersome. <br/>\nThe real solution IMO is to allow ShellBolts to override _codeDir and provide a path to the python/nodejs/code. We currently do that with reflection magic in our base classes.<br/>\nThat way the examples could specify where to find the dynamic code folder. and that's it.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612504203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/62295379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/286#issuecomment-62295379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/286","id":62295379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjk1Mzc5","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-09T07:59:40Z","updated_at":"2014-11-09T07:59:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@itaifrenkel
