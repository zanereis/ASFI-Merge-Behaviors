\r\nBut recently we also added another payload impl called DefaultHoodieRecordPayload. This payload will honor preCombine field while reconciling an incoming record with whats in storage using the preCombine field value(within combineAndGetUpdateValue()).\r\n\r\nI have a confusion on similar lines. Can you please clarify and correct my understanding.\r\n\r\nHow are following config differ in DefaultHoodieRecordPayload, which config will it choose to select record.\r\n\r\n1. hoodie.payload.ordering.field\r\n2. hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field\r\n\r\nWith the same payload class is there a possibility to disable precombine during deduplicating in same incremental batch but allow deciding whether or not to update existing record.\r\n\r\nI tried DefaultHoodiePayload class with\r\nhoodi.combine.before.insert=false and not providing precombine field but has payload.ordering.field.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario it thrower an error of missing precombine field column.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/926697926/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/926729084","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2948#issuecomment-926729084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2948","id":926729084,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43PMN8","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-24T15:43:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T15:43:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tandonraghav @veenaypatil Can you try this patch: #3203 \r\nI could not reproduce with it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/926729084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/926745203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3344#issuecomment-926745203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3344","id":926745203,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43PQJz","user":{"login":"ziudu","id":87431810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NDMxODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87431810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu","html_url":"https://github.com/ziudu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ziudu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-24T16:04:31Z","updated_at":"2021-09-25T03:21:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"sorry for the late reply. \r\n\r\nwe used 4-node Hadoop cluster for testing, each node is an ESXi virtual machine (8c@2.1GHz, 32GB, HDD virtual disk),\r\n\r\nWe tested several different ways for the initial load: \r\n\r\n1) The fastest way is to load the data in Hive format, and then convert them to Hudi format. We used DataX to extract data from DB and load it into Hadoop. The speed is 80K record per second, the conversion is slower, around 30K per second. But it is very easy to parallelize and easy to manage. We tested 2 DataX instances, the load speed is 150K per second(linear!).  I think the speed is limited only by the hardware configuration. Since the result is already satisfactory, we didn't test further.\r\n\r\n2) We tested streaming upsert with a scala application, the speed is 3K per second. This speed is largely enough for a micro service application's continuous ingestion process.\r\n\r\n3) We tested bulk insert, but it is even slower than upsert (1.5K per second). \r\n\r\nSo what we are doing now is :\r\nA. Write an application to scan database metadata and store them into Linkedin Datahub.\r\nB. Write an application to generate various configuration files for dataX, kafka, debezium etc from Linkedin Datahub and automatize the initial load and continuous ingestion process.\r\nC. Write a scala application which could subscribe to a range of topics and ingest data.\r\nD. We've chosen method 1 for initial load for the moment. It is not beautiful but it's fast.\r\n\r\nWe haven't tested the scala application's performance if there are lots of tables (e.g. > 1000) in a single DB.\r\nWe haven't tested Deltastreamer in Hudi 0.9 yet.
