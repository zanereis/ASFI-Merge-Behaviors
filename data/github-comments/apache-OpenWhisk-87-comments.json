Pass the key as the output of the action, rather than the raw data. This is a common pattern to pass large amounts of data between actions once you get above a certain size. \r\n\r\n- Use the Apache Kafka integration as a message queue for invoking actions from these messages. Push the individual items onto the queue and then connect the receiving functions as a trigger feed source. They will be invoked on demand. \r\n\r\n- Use a fan-out and wait approach rather than a sequence. Have the action which produces this JSON manually split up and invoke the actions using the client SDK. The parent action will fire off the worker requests and then return once they have all returned. The disadvantage of this style is that you'll pay twice for the execution time, as the parent action will have to block waiting on the responses. \r\n\r\n- Extend the Docker image to write the arguments to a file and then pass in the filename as the function call parameter. \r\n\r\nI would say that passing so much data directly between actions is not the usual approach. Most people use intermediary services like kafka to manage situations like this.

think the catalog should be installed like the alarm, cloudant, and Kafka feeds: from their own repos. I don't install the catalog from this repo because for day to day developelent it's not needed. And when I do need to, I don't run post deploy/catalog playbook and instead run out of the catalg repo (which then allows for controlled deployment like you're suggesting). \r\n\r\nI would package a post deploy playbook perhaps in an extras repository, and do the pinning there. My hestiation to pinning the catalog from this repo is we end up with lots of \"bump\" commits. \r\n\r\nIn general we are striving to have as few circular dependencies in this repo to dependent repos. So I would sever dependence on the catalog. With the exception of the swift tests, I think all tests in this repo are self contained.
