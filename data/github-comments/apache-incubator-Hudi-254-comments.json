In that sense BIMQ is just the way for us to balance b/w the speed of reading and the speed of writing -- if, say, reader is reading too fast and writing is not able to keep up, our memory buffers (filled by reader) might overflow leading to an OOM. BIMQ in that case will serve as a back-pressure mechanism slowing down the reader (with locks) until writer is able to catch up.\r\n\r\nAvoiding locks in that path will be able to reduce our compute footprint by about ~10%, but from what i've seen so far i don't think we'd be able to get more than that out of it

Also Glad to have more discussions :)\r\n\r\n1. Disruptor not only performs well in the multi-production multi-consumption model, but also has good performance in single production and consumption scenarios due to the lock-free design. Based on https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Performance-Results. And it is officially recommended to use a single-production model in the disruptor https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/user-guide/index.html#_introduction \r\n> One of the best ways to improve performance in concurrent systems is to adhere to the [Single Writer Principle](https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/09/single-writer-principle.html), this applies to the Disruptor. If you are in the situation where there will only ever be a single thread producing events into the Disruptor, then you can take advantage of this to gain additional performance.\r\n\r\n2. I am not sure why it may lead to a OOM `when reader is reading too fast and writing is not able to keep up`.  Based on my limited knowledge, when consumers consume data quickly and producers produce data relatively slowly, consumers will continue to wait, which affects the throughput of the application. What we want is to allow the producer's data to be delivered to the consumer side as soon as possible, thereby improving CPU usage and throughput. This is why we want to use the queue of Disruptor to improve the efficiency of data flow through a lock-free design.\r\n3. I also fully agree with your point that the disruptor cannot solve all problems, nor can it achieve satisfactory optimization results in all scenarios. This depends on where the performance bottleneck of the user's hudi ingestion is. For example, like the scenario simulated in the benchmark, if the user's schema is relatively simple, the downstream consumption is fast, and the bottleneck is production or a lot of time is spent waiting for the data to be ready, then the Disruptor may be able to play the greatest value in this scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for conclusion `avoiding locks in that path will be able to reduce our

Based on my limited knowledge, when consumers consume data quickly and producers produce data relatively slowly, consumers will continue to wait, which affects the throughput of the application. What we want is to allow the producer's data to be delivered to the consumer side as soon as possible, thereby improving CPU usage and throughput. This is why we want to use the queue of Disruptor to improve the efficiency of data flow through a lock-free design.\r\n\r\nThe scenario w/ OOM is the opposite of what you're describing: when producer is faster than the consumer -- in that case, w/o back-pressure mechanism producer will continue to produce filling in the in-memory buffers, with consumer not being able to catch up fast enough, which might eventually end up w/ OOM.\r\n\r\nSo i see some value in having the back-pressure mechanism but that frankly speaking doesn't require us to be grabbing locks in the hot-path -- it could be implemented even w/ Disruptor queue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1184818569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1184822319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6087#issuecomment-1184822319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6087","id":1184822319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5GnvQv","user":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-14T19:33:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T19:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Got it.

So, it appears that it does not affect users in a critical way. Keeping the default value consistent as Hive is important as Presto, Trino and Spark all use same default partition value.

@YannByron ,\r\n\r\nThanks for this PR and a well written [RFC-51](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/rfc/rfc-51/rfc-51.md).\r\nOverall I agree with the high level direction. I will do the code review soon. I have a question before that. \r\n\r\nShould we introduce a new concept (CDC) here on Hudi tables? I think this should be sub-mode of Incremental Query. \r\nFor illustration, Suppose we have something like the following modes for incremental query (change stream)\r\n- LATEST_STATE_INSERT_DELETE_KEYS (entire row state for all inserted keys and empty delete keys?)\r\n- LATEST_STATE_ONLY_INSERT_KEYS\r\n- MIN_STATE_CHANGE_INSERT_DELETE_KEYS (only columns changed and consolidate multiple inserts,deletes, or remove data inserted and deleted within the time range)\r\n- ALL_STATE_CHANGES_INSERT_DELETE_KEYS (include every single change made to the key)\r\n\r\nI think read-schema changes for the CDC style incremental queries could be a challenge. \r\n\r\nThe reason I think of converging the incremental queries with RFC-51 is because \r\n- Removes the limitation of tracking deletes accross compaction boundaries for incremental queries\r\n- I think it just makes sense for us to track the data we track when \"cdc.supplemental.logging=false\" by default for all Hudi tables. Having this data stored efficiently for point lookups will help with record merging as well I suppose?\r\n\r\n@YannByron What do you think? (cc @vinothchandar )\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nPrasanna\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186159978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186168771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6065#issuecomment-1186168771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6065","id":1186168771,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Gs3_D","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-16T12:13:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T12:13:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta

@prasannarajaperumal Thank you very much for reviewing this.\r\n\r\nCDC is not a new concept, is a common concept for database. So I think it's better to distinguish CDC and `Incremental Query`. Some reasons: \r\n- CDC is better known than incremental query. `incremental query` is just defined by hudi.\r\n- Different from `Incremental Query` and `Snapshot Query`, CDC has its own output format in which every record have `op`, `ts_ms`, `before` and `after` fields.\r\n- According to RFC-51, CDC has its own read and write logical. We have to persist some other information for CDC when data is written to hudi.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186545393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186610132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5630#issuecomment-1186610132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5630","id":1186610132,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5GujvU","user":{"login":"Neuw84","id":5920770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjA3NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5920770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84","html_url":"https://github.com/Neuw84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neuw84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-17T21:26:42Z","updated_at":"2022-07-17T21:26:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot run azure","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186610132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186639295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6125#issuecomment-1186639295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6125","id":1186639295,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Guq2_","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-18T00:17:43Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T00:17:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hey @vingov can you take a look please?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186639295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1186641237","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6104#issuecomment-1186641237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6104","id":1186641237,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5GurVV","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-18T00:23:46Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T00:23:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"it does make sense to have one.
