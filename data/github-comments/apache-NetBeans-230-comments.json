I have this problem, when the name is the same but I will investigate deeper. Maybe a problem with the new implementation from me?\r\n\r\nNot sure; this seems like a layer registration problem rather than an SVG icon loading related problem. The icon shown in your screenshot is the general one for XML files, as you already noticed.\r\n\r\n> Just a question, I also use the zoomIn/zoomOut icon from org/netbeans/modules/image/zoomOut.gif. Is this correct or should I copy them over to the new svg module?\r\n\r\nI'm not actually sure what the rules are for when a module can access the resource files from another module. I'd suspect you can reference existing icons in modules that your own module has a dependency on, so long as those icons are in a public package of the referenced module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2546606163/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2546616505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7938#issuecomment-2546616505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7938","id":2546616505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Xyki5","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-16T20:03:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-16T20:04:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Not sure; this seems like a layer registration problem rather than an SVG icon loading related problem.

Ok, I thought your problem was, that the rendering was\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> .rule,\r\n> .rule2\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> with only the first one visible. Then I suggest to indeed push this down into the css module as that is a general problem in the structure scanner there. As you can see in my screenshot, the same issue is present in the navigator view. Given the origin of the two trees is the same it is not to surprising.\r\n\r\nThe structure parser delivers the list of rules separated by a linefeed like in the editor view and the breadcrumb module simple removes this linefeed with no addition (displayed as HTML I suppose), hence no space between the rules in the list. The same problem is within the navigator view. \r\n\r\nI am not familiar with the structure scanner. So how should this rule list delivered so that all displaying parts still work. Now it's quite convenient because it's just a string.\r\n\r\nSo wouldn't it be the easiest way to simply do the same change in the node factory for a css file?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2558620770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2558679567","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8082#issuecomment-2558679567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8082","id":2558679567,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6YgloP","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-23T00:24:00Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T00:24:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tenzap
