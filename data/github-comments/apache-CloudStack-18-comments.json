@bhaisaab \n\nNo, it doesn't change pwd in the hosts. I will implement that in a separate story/issue.\n\nConcerning the squash, I won't do it. Why? The commits are atomic, which makes easier to review (e.g. one doesn't need t review commits that say \"formatting code...\"). I split code formatting from the fixes. Another point, if there is a change in a given commit, I will change just that commit and push it, which reduces the work for the person behind the fixes as well. On a third point, if we squash atomic commits, the reviewer will have the whole huge thing to look at, as everything has just be done together.\n\nIn short, squashing those atomic commits will bring no benefit at all.\n\nSquash would only help if someone messes up with the commits and have everything tangled, which is not the case with this PR.\n\nIf you look at the bullet point on the PR description, those are the most relevant commits to look at. I even took care of using the same commit title for the bullet points.\n\nI will start testing this evening.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/115289744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/115305839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/489#issuecomment-115305839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/489","id":115305839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTMwNTgzOQ==","user":{"login":"eriweb","id":6181934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODE5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6181934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb","html_url":"https://github.com/eriweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eriweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-25T16:08:33Z","updated_at":"2015-06-25T16:08:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Excellent,

Rohit,\n\nBoth username and passwords are needed, and we don't want to remove them and we would like to know what they are, however, it would be great if we can obfuscate the password leaving only first 2 characters visible and making it X chars long.\n\nFor example, if password is \"MySuperPass\", perhaps the output would be \"My******************************\"\n\nWe don't want to expose the actual passwords length, so if we can fill it with extra \"*\" that would help. I'm not certain what restrictions are there, perhaps 32 chars maybe enough.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/115915514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/116253463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/537#issuecomment-116253463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/537","id":116253463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjI1MzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-28T10:47:00Z","updated_at":"2015-06-28T10:47:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-requests

long as people make good commits, that are atomic, capture relevant changes together, and have descriptive messages, IMHO squashing only make things worse.\n\nIf you squash commits, all you get is less commits. Some people might say a cleaner master branch.\nI won't discuss aesthetics here. I will try to be objective.\n\nWith less commits you also get larger commits. That means that in a change set (e.g. a PR) where a large number of changes are made, these changes are all bundled together. That forces the reviewer to take all the context at once. \nWith more commits you get smaller commits. That allows the reviewer to take chunks of context at a time. And, in addition, if the reviewer wants/needs to get all the context at once, it is easy to make a diff between the first and the last commit in the change set (Github offers both per commit view and total diff view, just see the tabs on top of this PR).\n\nIf you will, this is comparable to reviewing a class will several small methods or reviewing a class with one big method.\n\nAnother interesting aspect that should be considered is reverting commits. As you may all know this can happen quite frequently. With smaller, atomic commits, it is easer to revert a change (e.g a bug introducing change) in a particular part of the code (while leaving the rest of the code untouched). It is easier because (1) the small commit isolates the change; (2) in the presence of conflicts these can be fixed iteratively, in small steps.\n\nFinally, I would like to point out that smaller commits allow the developer to convey more information about each change. If you squash a set of commits you loose the description of all the small changes.\nDo we really want to go towards less information about code changes? Or do we want to have the developers write a bullet list of the changes they made and assign them to parts of the code? There simply isn't any other way to preserve this information.\n\nOf course that, as I already said, all this only makes sense if:\n- commits are small;\n- atomic;\n- have good descriptions.\n\nAnd that is, simply put, entry-level development discipline.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117186219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117363496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/546#issuecomment-117363496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/546","id":117363496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzM2MzQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-30T22:37:06Z","updated_at":"2015-06-30T22:37:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Wilder Rodrigues  on dev@cloudstack.apache.org>\" <dev@cloudstack.apache.org replies:\nHey guys,\n\nAnyone willing to have a look at this PR?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n\nSent from my iPhone\nto decouple the execute of the commands, which was handled into several pri=\nvate methods in the class.\nng them with another class.

, \nBackground -\n1. When CS tries to live migrate a volume, it chooses a host endpoint to perform the migration by selecting any host that has the storage containing the volume mounted on it. Now when we attempt to migrate a volume that is on a zone wide storage, the endpoint could be any host in the zone because in case of zone wide storage, every host in the zone has the storage mounted on it. \n2. During migration, vCenter expects the target datastore/storage pool to be mounted on the source host because the VM obviously needs to be able to access the target datastore.\n\nNow in the mentioned issue, say a host that doesn't contain the VM is chosen as the endpoint. As mentioned above, it could happen because today CS chooses any host that has the source storage mounted on it. In that case migration will fail because this host cant see the target datastore. \n\nBy picking the host containing the volume's VM as endpoint we ensure that both the source and target storage pools are visible to the VM irrespective of the scope of the storage pool.\n\nPreviously, similar fixes have been made for other operations like volume deletion, snapshot creation because in these cases as well the underlying resource needs the VM of the volume to be visible to the host endpoint.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117515627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117517228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/531#issuecomment-117517228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/531","id":117517228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzUxNzIyOA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T07:59:34Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T07:59:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wilderrodrigues let's stick to that for now (I kind of did the last few findbugs thing to see what happened with them:)\n\nLGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117517228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117517309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/541#issuecomment-117517309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/541","id":117517309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzUxNzMwOQ==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T07:59:57Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T07:59:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @likitha \n\nI understood what the issue says, but what I really meant concerns what the code does.\n\nThe only practical change in the code was this:\n\nif (volume.getHypervisorType() == Hypervisor.HypervisorType.Hyperv || volume.getHypervisorType() == Hypervisor.HypervisorType.VMware) {\n...\n}\n\nWhich means that now it will also get in the IF when the Hypervisor is of HypervisorType.VMware type.\n\nSo, what you really want is: support volume migration from zone-wide to cluster-wide storage when hypervisor is VMware.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nIf you look further at the code, when CS will do DELETEVOLUME, it would take into account only VMware.

@likitha \n\nAnd what about DeleteVolume? It now supports only VMware, but the MigrateVolume supports both VMware and HyperV. It would be nice to keep it consistent.\n\nI have 2 suggestions:\n1. Edit the issue title to make sure that it complies with your fix. Something like this: Failed to migrate a volume from zone-wide to cluster-wide storage when using VMware.\n2. If you don't mind, create another issue to deal with the StorageAction.DELETEVOLUME and change it in a separate PR. I think it should be consistent.\n\nYou got my LGTM based on the explanations you gave.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117541379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/117559997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/541#issuecomment-117559997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/541","id":117559997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNzU1OTk5Nw==","user":{"login":"likitha","id":1097805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha","html_url":"https://github.com/likitha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-01T09:26:13Z","updated_at":"2015-07-01T09:26:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for taking the time to review @wilderrodrigues.\nI have updated the issue description.\nAs far as 'StorageAction.DELETEVOLUME' is concerned I am not entirely sure if the same logic applies to HyperV, In case of VMware since we can't access volume managed object, we reconfigure the VM managed object to detach the volume and further delete it.
