Its name would be \"headerA\" and its value would be \"headerAValue\". FlowFile attributes would not be sent as headers.\r\n- Else, the headers would be any FlowFile attribute that matches the \"Attributes to Send as Headers (Regex)\" property\r\n\r\nNow, as for the other...\r\n```\r\nif (Use Wrapper) {\r\n    Kafka Record:\r\n    Key = { \"type\": \"person\" }\r\n    Value = { \"name\": \"Mark\", \"number\": 49 }\r\n    Headers = A single header with name \"headerA\", value \"headerAValue\"\r\n} else {\r\n    Kafka Record:\r\n    Key = <Depends on the value of the 'Message Key Field' property>\r\n    Value = <The entire JSON payload. I.e.,:>\r\n    {\r\n                       \"key\": {\r\n                           \"type\": \"person\"\r\n                        },\r\n                       \"value\": {\r\n                            \"name\": \"Mark\",\r\n                            \"number\": 49\r\n                       },\r\n                       \"headers\": {\r\n                             \"headerA\": \"headerAValue\"\r\n                       }\r\n     }\r\n    Headers = <Whatever matches the 'Attributes to Send as Headers (Regex)' property>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, in short, if Use Wrapper, the incoming FlowFile must have 3 fields:\r\nKey. This becomes the kafka message key.\r\nValue. This becomes the contents of the kafka message.\r\nHeaders. This becomes the headers attached to the kafka message.\r\nAny other fields, such as metadata, would be ignored.\r\n\r\nIf NOT using wrapper, it would function as it always has. The entire contents of the Record go as the kafka message payload. The key and headers are determined based on the configured \"Message Key Field\" and \"Attributes to Send as Headers (Regex)\" properties.\r\n\r\nIn this way, if the wrapper is being used by both, we can have ConsumeKafkaRecord_2_6 -> PublishKafkaRecord_2_6 and this will pull kafka messages from 1 topic and push to another topic. Each message in the destination would have the same key, value, and headers as the original mressage.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Or have I confused things even worse?

Thanks for the contribution @krisztina-zsihovszki!\r\n> \r\n> Most of the implementation looks straightforward, I noted several documentation-related recommendations.\r\n> \r\n> One high-level question is handling credentials. Did you evaluate whether it is possible to use the standard `OAuth2AccessTokenProvider` Controller Service to get the token information? If it works, it would remove the need for the Dropbox Credentials Service, and it would also simplify the configuration, removing the need for the manual token request mentioned in the additional details.\r\n\r\n@exceptionfactory \r\nThank you for the review comments! \r\nRegarding the authentication: it has been checked whether OAuth2AccessTokenProvider can be used for Dropbox authentication, unfortunately Dropbox does not support the OAuth standard properly, it does not let us generate the access/refresh tokens.\r\n\r\nThe authentication goes via redirection in case of [Dropbox](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#:~:text=To%20update%20your%20access%20token,is%20easier%20with%20an%20SDK) , other services handles the authentication with the help of this redirection, e.g. https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/pingfederate-dropbox-connector/page/jre1563995006135.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1228444131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1228652118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6329#issuecomment-1228652118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6329","id":1228652118,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5JO75W","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-26T15:41:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T15:41:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vitalyzhakov The standard Maven build does not create the Docker images, so testing the changes would require running a build with the `-P docker` profile activated.\r\n\r\nUnless other contributors offer a different perspective, removing these volume declarations does not look like something that should be changed in light of other common examples.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1228652118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/1228734755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6291#issuecomment-1228734755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/6291","id":1228734755,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM5JPQEj","user":{"login":"UcanInfosec","id":107478475,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmf9yw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107478475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec","html_url":"https://github.com/UcanInfosec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UcanInfosec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-26T17:12:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T17:12:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory thanks.

The main downside is when trying to extend the image, but the current images for Apache NiFi are not optimized to be used as base images. Many other people in the community have come up with alternatives images for Apache NiFi that reuse some of the same Dockerfile commands, but do not inherit from apache/nifi.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm planning to devote some time this fall to refactoring our approach to Docker images for the project, including separating out the base image from the final image, and also change our approach to sourcing external configurations, which will likely require re-evaluating our use of volumes. If you would like to offer suggestions for changes you would like to see in the Apache NiFi Docker images, we are collecting them here:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/NiFi+Docker+Container+Improvements. \r\n\r\nYou can request write access to the wiki on our [developer mailing list](https://nifi.apache.org/mailing_lists.html) or reply here and I'll be happy to add them to the wiki (with attribution). \r\n\r\nThanks!

The use of `VOLUME` separates the data in the the configuration, state, and nifi repository directories from the rest of the container. This adds operational flexibility. For example, the volume can be mounted on another container for migration or making backups [1]. For example, someone might want to run this nightly:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run --rm --volumes-from <container-id> --volume ~/backup:/backup ubuntu bash -c \"cd <path/to/volume/data> && tar -cvf /backup/<volume-backup>.tar .\"\r\n```\r\nSource: https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/security/docker-backup/\r\n\r\nThat said, as stated above, we are currently reevaluating our current approach to Docker images for the project, and a major area for improvement is making it easier to use bind mounts or named volumes for configuration or writeable storage. So I'd expect some changes and improvements in this area in the near future, but for now I'd prefer to keep the use of VOLUME in these Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n[1]
