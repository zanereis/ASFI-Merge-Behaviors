Hiveserver2 is a better choice for ad-hoc query. For scheduling purpose, you may try hive CLI. You could do it with shell task if you are using an old version of DS. If you are planning to upgrade DS, there will be a new `Hive CLI` task in the future. see: https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11651","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1240172686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1240175555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11842#issuecomment-1240175555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11842","id":1240175555,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5J65PD","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T03:33:35Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T03:33:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your feedback, we have received your issue, Please wait patiently for a reply.\n* In order for us to understand your request as soon as possible, please provide detailed information、version or pictures.\n* If you haven't received a reply for a long time, you can [join our slack](https://s.apache.org/dolphinscheduler-slack) and send your question to channel `#troubleshooting`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1240175555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1240175902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10540#issuecomment-1240175902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10540","id":1240175902,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5J65Ue","user":{"login":"EricGao888","id":34905992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTA1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34905992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888","html_url":"https://github.com/EricGao888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EricGao888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T03:34:27Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T03:34:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"According to the comments from #10889, the problem seems not to be on the DS side.

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar feature requirement.\n\n\n### Description\n\nThe indicators on the home page should be instructive in the operation and maintenance operation.(首页的指标要在运维操作中有一定的指导性)\n\n### Use case\n\nThis part needs in-depth discussion and redesign. Different roles care about different dimension indicators.\r\n1. Number of projects, number of online workflows/number of offline workflows, number of tasks to be scheduled/number of tasks that have been successfully scheduled\r\n2. Count the number of task successes, failures, stops, and other statuses by hour (the statuses need to be combined into a design)\r\n3. Statistics of running failures (by workflow dimension, count the number of times the schedule fails to execute on the date)\r\n4. Running time statistics (according to the workflow dimension, the average duration of scheduled execution on a statistical date)\r\n5. CPU, memory, load, number of tasks executed by sub-workers, etc. that the operation and maintenance personnel care about\r\n\r\n这部分需要深入讨论和重新设计下，不同的角色关心不同的维度指标。\r\n1. 项目数、上线的工作流数/ 下线的工作流数、应调度任务数/已经成功调度任务数\r\n2. 分小时统计任务成功、失败、停止、和其他状态的数量（需要把状态做一个合并设计）\r\n3. 运行失败的统计 （按工作流维度，统计日期调度执行失败的次数）\r\n4. 运行时长统计（按工作流维度，统计日期调度执行的平均时长）\r\n5. 运维人员关心的cpu、内存、负载、分worker执行任务数等\n\n### Related
