Instance is up and down, with scaling. The name of instance could/should change from time to time, especially in today's k8s deployment. I can't see the point of set sampling for a single instance.\r\n> 2. About endpoint, a.k.a. your interface. This would be a huge number of sampling, and as this sampler has to keep the seed for every endpoint(URI), if URI is parameterized, your OAP will be OOM eventually.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there are some premises of this usage scenario about the tow arguments:\r\n\r\n- Maybe in our performance testing environment, it will be of great help to us in troubleshooting performance problems when doing full-link performance tests, that is also a good support  point for full-link monitoring to full-link pressure testing.And at the same time, we usually only configure  endpoint sampling rate for endpoints according to our needs .\r\n\r\n- Or it could be that some instance of our production environment has an exception at that point in time. Of course, in most scenarios, the priority is to fix the problem and keep one or two instances in exception for troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n- `URI is parameterized`,I  remember that if URI is parameterized, it will be a parameterized URI as the span's `enpointName` such as  : `{POST}/urlpath/{id}`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9264192/123912941-36b16900-d9b0-11eb-8ec7-3d9409fb1c5a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I think should pay more attention to usage scenarios.And I think this is a kind of ability we should provide, and how to use it depends on the user.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/871135518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/871149299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/7200#issuecomment-871149299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7200","id":871149299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTE0OTI5OQ==","user":{"login":"xuanyu66","id":17768378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY4Mzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17768378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyu66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyu66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-30T07:02:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T07:04:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7086\r\nThis PR has already fix it, remove the condition  if (stackDepth == 1) \r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n    public ExitSpan log(Throwable t) {\r\n        super.log(t);\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/871149299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/871177178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7209#issuecomment-871177178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7209","id":871177178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTE3NzE3OA==","user":{"login":"codecov[bot]","id":22429695,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjI0Mjk2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/codecov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-30T07:50:53Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T08:11:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/skywalking/pull/7209?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7209](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/skywalking/pull/7209?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (6b52296) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/skywalking/commit/98968122e9887b81b7074945948a732ae6815d7d?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (9896812) will **decrease** coverage by `1.61%`.\n> The diff coverage is `48.34%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head 6b52296 differs from pull request most recent head 841a2a1.

> Could you give more explanation about what these changes for? What are the benefits for the users?\r\n> > SkyWalking never does things according to other projects, such as you said `The main idea comes from \"opentelemetry-java-instrumentation\".`. We focus on the product and tech parts.\r\n> \r\n> Ok. I have an ambiguity,sorry.\r\n> \r\n> In our company, skywalking is a very new concept, so I want to minimize the cost of access.\r\n> I can now allow users to click a button to access apm. This is pretty cool, so I am not going to change this approach.\r\n> so the [log4j2&logback-automatic-agent] can do this. only one button. (To be precise, you also need to add %X(traceid), but this will not change the POM)\r\n> \r\n> As for opentelemetry-java-instrumentation, I just borrowed their cut points. (org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.ContextDataInjectorFactory.createInjector and ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger)\r\n> The framework and main logic are based on the definition of skywalking.\r\n\r\nOK, I can get your points now. But we are very careful to provide a plugin like this. Actually we discussed about this from the day at beginning of the toolkit you see right now.\r\nOnce we have an auto instrumentation log injection, we face a risk to break user's log analysis system, such as prod env's ELK. Because we inject something breaking the existing pattern, but users would not expect this, as our agent is out of box, people are new to the project.\r\nAlso, we will have to inject all the logs, rather than the necessary logs which cause unnecessary costs.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether these make sense to you, but those are the reasons we don't have this today.
