I had a look at the fix for the `CopyOnWriteStateTable`, I afraid it's still a partial fix, I just create a JIRA for it and will give a PR for it very soon. \r\n\r\nIn short, the another partial problem is that we reuse the `snaphotData` as the output array when partitioning the data, but the `snapshotData` is max length is `1 << 30`. So when the records in `CopyOnWriteStateTable` is more than `1 << 30` (e.g. 1 <<30 + 1), then the check `Preconditions.checkState(partitioningDestination.length >= numberOfElements);` could be failed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/397802465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/397803284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6174#issuecomment-397803284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6174","id":397803284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzgwMzI4NA==","user":{"login":"sihuazhou","id":7480427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7480427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sihuazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-16T10:26:29Z","updated_at":"2018-06-16T10:26:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CC

for the contribution. I think the general idea is good, but I think the implementation can be improved. How about changing `CopyOnWriteStateTable::snapshotTableArrays()` in such ways that the returned snapshot array is already created with a size of `max(whateverTheCurrentCodeDoes, size())`. This prevents that we ever have to create another array, in particular in this corner case where we are dealing with huge arrays. Then the remaining code should automagically work without further changes. Adding some nice comment might help that our optimized snapshotting algorithm assumes that the array can hold the flattened entries.

job name is useful, the uniq ID may not useful, because our metric data contains (`jm_id`, `tm_id`).\r\n\r\nso, for pushgateway, the jobName is used to distinguish different services.\r\nfor grafana, the prefix of jobName can use to distinguish different clusters, we also can just use JM/TM ID and ignore the jobName.\r\n\r\n`FLINK-9543` is useful and important.

It is not the responsibility of a `reporter` to introduce a `cluster_id` tag. Reporters are to faithfully report the metrics and their associated variables, not add more. Instead we may want to think about adding a configurable `cluster_id` value.\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way we have arrived at my previous question, random ID vs actual ID. That the `job_name` will be equal to `tm/jm_id` is precisely why i prefer this approach, it doesn't introduce additional noise in the tags.\r\n\r\nI've already started working on `FLINK-9543` so we can proceed with this PR; the issue must be extended to also expose an ID for Dispatchers and register the JVM metrics for each JM. as to your question, `ResourceID`s are exactly what we're looking for; this is also what we're using for `TaskExecutor`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/398348110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/398372271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6147#issuecomment-398372271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6147","id":398372271,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODM3MjI3MQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-19T11:53:08Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T11:53:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
