I'm going to take a look at this use case.  Is the INSERT_OVERWRITE the only write action, i.e., no other inserts, updates, deletes, bulk inserts, etc.?  This is not a table service action, though it generates the replacecommit, which is in the same format as clustering.  INSERT_OVERWRITE should also update the metadata table with delta commits, and there shouldn't be any reason that the compaction does not kick in the metadata table.  Do you have reproducible steps?\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind the constraint that prevents the archival of commits in the data table after the latest compaction commit of the metadata table is that the compaction of the metadata table is fenced by the condition that we trigger compaction only when there are no inflight requests in data table.  This ensures that all base files in the metadata table are always in sync with the data table (w/o any holes) and only there could be some extra invalid commits among delta log files in metadata table.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1254250370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1254251993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6711#issuecomment-1254251993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6711","id":1254251993,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Kwl3Z","user":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T21:35:18Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T21:35:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danny0405

The config naming of `partition_key` is confusing to new comers.  Here's what you need to do:\r\n(1) As @xushiyan already mentioned, you don't need to set the credentials in env variables if the instance or service is already granted access with the proper roles;\r\n(2) By default, `hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key` is set to the table name, so that multiple writers writing to the same table share the same lock.  If you customize the name, make sure it's the same for multiple writers;\r\n(3) Note that, what `hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key` specifies actually means the value to use for the column, and not the column name itself.  The column name is fixed to be `key` in DynamoDB table;\r\n(4) The DynamoDB table for locking purposes is automatically created from the Hudi code, so you don't have to create the table yourself.  If you do so, make sure that the `key` column is present in the table, not `lock` or the value specified by `hoodie.write.lock.dynamodb.partition_key`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this solves your problem.

When both docker containers run in the same host machine everything work well since the containers can connect to each other with docker bridge network(As the hudi docker demo is also one of this scenario). So i'm trying to find out how exactly hudi and spark connect to each other during this process. First i thought if the HoodieSparkEngineContext init successfully the connection part is over. Apparently there is something more. For example the timeline server and remoteFilySystemView also should be reachable because the application will be running in the spark worker node.
