I will wait for a few hours and merge if there are no other comments.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/155823471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/155833907","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/166#issuecomment-155833907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/166","id":155833907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTgzMzkwNw==","user":{"login":"sureshsubbiah","id":3596671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshsubbiah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-11T16:22:30Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T16:22:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Selva, do you have any objections to merging this change?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/155833907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/155834708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/169#issuecomment-155834708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/169","id":155834708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NTgzNDcwOA==","user":{"login":"sureshsubbiah","id":3596671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshsubbiah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-11T16:25:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-11T16:25:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Change looks good.
