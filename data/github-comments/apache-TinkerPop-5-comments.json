I'm fairly certain I am failing the case above (read graph only has 1 edge) while executing from gremlin.sh. This issue came up because I am converting a graph into a gson file for every vertex and for every edge, but self edges are consistently missing. I have been working off of tp31, but this still occurs in gremlin.sh of the master branch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/164073855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/164090219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/175#issuecomment-164090219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/175","id":164090219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDA5MDIxOQ==","user":{"login":"laxatives","id":16109646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTA5NjQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16109646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives","html_url":"https://github.com/laxatives","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laxatives/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T00:43:17Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T16:01:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"D'oh.

Maybe its better to include self edges in both edges(OUT) and edges(IN)? This would also ensure that every graph G has G.V().edgesOut().count() + G.V().edgesIn().count() == 2 \\* G.edges().count(), which is clearly not the case now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/164090219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/164090851","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/175#issuecomment-164090851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/175","id":164090851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDA5MDg1MQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-12T00:49:56Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T00:49:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sounds right, but I think we need to think through the wider implications this change would have.  `StarGraph` is central to a lot of stuff that happens in OLAP traversals.
