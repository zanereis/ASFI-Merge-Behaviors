There is missing values at the _beginning_ of the time-series.\r\n2. There is missing values at the _end_ of the time-series.\r\n3. There are missing values resulting in a single _siloed_ data point as well as _adjacent_ data points. \r\n\r\nFor context the data set is defined as:\r\n\r\n![sql-lab-preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312685-c3904880-4594-11e9-884a-3618038ec9ee.png)\r\n\r\nBellow are examples of the current and proposed charts. Additionally I tested other chart types which could have been potentially impacted by this change. \r\n\r\n**Line Chart (current)**\r\n\r\n![line-chart-current](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312343-f2f28580-4593-11e9-96be-5699875fa048.png)\r\n\r\n**Line Chart (proposed)**\r\n\r\n![line-chart-proposed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312344-f2f28580-4593-11e9-92cf-6eeeda46837f.png)\r\n\r\nNote that there is an issue with the NDV3 line chart where the siloed data point does not render other than when one hovers over it. This issue will be fixed with the `data-ui` toolkit.\r\n\r\n**Pie Chart (current)**\r\n\r\n![pie-chart-current](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312324-e706c380-4593-11e9-87b8-014517db40f4.png)\r\n\r\n**Pie Chart (proposed)**\r\n\r\n![pie-chart-proposed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312325-e706c380-4593-11e9-8b12-1d9ec8ecd158.png)\r\n\r\nNote there is no change here, though the code has been changed to ensure that the NULL values are not dropped in the pivot-table. Internally there was some debate whether this was the right approach, but I sense i) it ensures consistency with other charts, and ii) it accurately represents the underly result set, i.e., it informs the user that a dimension exists however the value is either zero of undefined.  \r\n\r\n**Bar Chart (current)**\r\n\r\n![bar-chart-current](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54313274-31893f80-4596-11e9-8ecc-f1b074e526be.png)\r\n\r\n**Bar Chart (proposed)**\r\n\r\n![bar-chart-proposed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54313275-3221d600-4596-11e9-9854-ffbb39b10b00.png)\r\n\r\nNote this remains unchanged like the Pie Chart and ensures consistency in terms of defining either zero or undefined values.\r\n\r\n**Pivot Table (current)**\r\n\r\n![pivot-table-current](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312326-e706c380-4593-11e9-9b22-6f6c362fa575.png)\r\n\r\n**Pivot Table (proposed)**\r\n\r\n![pivot-table-proposed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/54312380-11588100-4594-11e9-839a-dd2d9bf55c22.png)\r\n\r\nNote there seems to be an issue with any value other than an empty string being rendered as `NaN`. The current code uses an empty string as the `na_rep` for [`pandas.DataFrame.to_html`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.3/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_html.html) which is inconsistent with the Table visualization type. Additionally I explicitly made Pandas behave like SQL where the summation of only NULLs returns NULL.\r\n\r\nto: @kristw @michellethomas @mistercrunch @williaster

I suggest lengthening sort by a bit and then allowing search to fill in the rest of the gap. It would be great if it matched how we do this on the dashboard editor pane > charts section.\r\n- The need datasource notice in the middle of the canvas could use a little more visual hierarchy. Right now it looks slightly like a disabled button. Maybe something happens when you click on it? Focuses the user on section 1.\r\n- The hover state highlight will be a neutral color right? Right now it looks like a Lyft specific color?\r\n- Can we get rid of the \"-\" before untitled? Maybe say Untitled to promote human readable titles.\r\n- Love the thoughtful move to step 2 if coming from SQL Lab!\r\n- Under select a chat type could we add sort by and search? Sort by popularity. You're kind of doing this already with the order roughly I think?\r\n- In place of sort by add a dropdown for selecting the goal of the vis such as comparison and apply a different visual treatment to the types that aren't ideal for comparison. It wouldn't be too hard for us to all align on groupings of the visualizations.\r\n- For eyeball and beaker icons. The icons in Superset today are pretty bad. I would learn on textual buttons in place of icons when/if possible.\r\n- Between step 1 and 3 the styles look similar but appear to me as a little different. To reduce visual fragmentation can we leverage the existing styles as much as possible? Or plan on updating the step 3 styles to match?\r\n- I wonder if the brand green color would work better for the 1, 2, 3 step headers?

We should align on a single style for primary actions. In this context create new chart is certainly a primary action. Using the filled style will also help improve discoverability.\r\n- Love the rationale behind moving the panel to the left.\r\n- Re: the name of the dashboard on creation is there a way to make it more human readable? Remove underscore? Also the uppercase U here is at contrast with the lowercase chart placeholder title text.\r\n- I'm on board with removing the charts out of their own tab and bringing them to the forefront. A few things we should consider here is 1. Setting expectations about where the new chart will appear. This could be help text underneath the + Create New Chart button. \r\n- The way the existing panel improved discoverability of the different components the user could apply to their dashboard was by writing out the entire title. We dual encoded title with icon. To solve for this here would be to write the name of the component under the icon in small text and/or hover tips like you mentioned. It would be cool if we explained purpose of the component as well.\r\n- This structural cue as you called it works better than the button looking style on the create new chart flow. Could we align them?\r\n- Sort by and search/filter your charts looks better here than in create new chart. Seeing the outlined inputs for sort by and search makes me think the create new chart button should be filled to improve the hierarchy.\r\n- Love the thumbnails! Nice considerations for disable as optional.\r\n- Today when I edit a dashboard there is visual context for what charts have and have not been applied. How will this be handled?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/472665106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/472679987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7030#issuecomment-472679987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7030","id":472679987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjY3OTk4Nw==","user":{"login":"srggrs","id":34258464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjU4NDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34258464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs","html_url":"https://github.com/srggrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srggrs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-14T02:28:28Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T02:28:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@john-bodley okay I'll pull master over, test my changes and re-submit eventually.

@betodealmeida this is a big change that has the potential to impact many many users. If you're unable to provide numbers that indicate that this is strictly an improvement (or at a minimum no regressions), I'm a bit reluctant to introduce this additional complexity.\r\n\r\n> I think it's part of the expected work of a feature like this to demonstrate the effects with real-life examples. It seems like you should be able to use real Lyft dashboards, dashboards from the \"example datasets\", etc., and you can throttle network speed using dev tools.\r\n\r\nSure, I will give the numbers of the example dashboards and some of the Lyft dashboards. My point was that, considering that this is a strict improvement, defining a threshold to accept the changes seems arbitrary to me.\r\n\r\nOf course I agree that if this causes a regression or no significant improvement we should not do it. Maybe it's not clear, but with this PR the client will **always** issue a smaller number of requests, and a percentage of those requests will receive body-less responses. Combined with the fact that we move the server cache closer to the user, there shouldn't be any regressions with this PR, unless I'm doing something stupid (which I've done in the past).\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that this PR is against the `lyftga` branch, so we expect to test it in production before merging into `master`.\r\n\r\n> Another concern I have is the impact on the # of requests. We've needed to introduce domain sharding because of the large number of simultaneous requests made by larger dashboards, and this potential DOUBLES that number, so I would want to see perf numbers that demonstrate no regressions for that case as well.\r\n\r\nSorry, why do you think this would double the number of requests? The number of requests should be strictly equal or smaller: resources within the lifetime of the cache are no longer requested because the browser reads directly from its cache, and conditional requests are still a single request. The server will either return a normal response (`200 OK`) or a `304 Not Modified` without body. There's no pre-flight request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/473206698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/473218162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/6426#issuecomment-473218162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6426","id":473218162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzIxODE2Mg==","user":{"login":"smith01s","id":33288907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjg4OTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33288907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s","html_url":"https://github.com/smith01s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith01s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T09:33:26Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T10:20:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I am also having the same problem.
