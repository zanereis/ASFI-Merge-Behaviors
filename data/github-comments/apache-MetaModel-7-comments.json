yes you're right. That should give a good boost in performance in deed!\r\n\r\nFunctionally the code looks good to me. I am not 100% sure about what I think about the JoinHelper class. It's only made up of static methods which means that all it's methods could just as well be directly part of MetaModelHelper. And MetaModelHelper is IMO already a kind of a junkdrawer of static methods, so I don't think I want another :-) On the other hand, something that would maybe be nice is if you made the JoinHelper class non-static so that you would instantiate it like this:\r\n```\r\nDataSetJoiner joiner = new DataSetJoiner(fromItemWithJoin);\r\nDataSet dataSet = joiner.join(dataSets);\r\n```\r\n(or something quite similar to this)\r\n\r\nI think then we would have a class that's quite nicely built and scoped such that it cannot be used out of context (statically). So that would be my suggestion for a more pretty design :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/317227713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/317228640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/150#issuecomment-317228640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/150","id":317228640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzIyODY0MA==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-23T04:42:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-23T04:42:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Patched (but I moved the Guava dependency to the jdbc module).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/317228640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/317342614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/148#issuecomment-317342614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/148","id":317342614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzM0MjYxNA==","user":{"login":"LosD","id":1282832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD","html_url":"https://github.com/LosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-24T07:36:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T07:36:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My 2 cents regarding helpers (without having looked at the actual code): While any kind of utility or helper class is an anti pattern, if the JoinHelper centers around the same subject and MetaModelHelper does not, it's much preferable to keep them separate.

Essentially I feel that there is a pitfall which is that it makes it hard for people to contribute good code if their tool has very minor discrepancies with the code style. That said, I think a minimum set is very nice to have in place...\r\n\r\nOne of the things I notice here though is the import statement ordering. I believe that 99% of our codebase today is sorted using eclipse's standard settings. If we require some other ordering then my next question is: How do we explain to contributors (myself included) how to set up their IDE.

At least Eclipse and IntelliJ has that option.\r\n\r\nThe hard part is making them agree 100%... E.g. Eclipse and IDEA has rather different ways of formatting ternary operators, especially when there's also method chains involved. And Eclipse has this lame-o thing with grouping top-level domains (org, com, dk, etc.) in own sort groups (seemingly in reverse alphabetical order, just because), instead of just java and javax. IDEA doesn't have that option, so you need to specify those groups manually. Eclipse also has this (very nice) feature with separate line lengths for JavaDoc and code which IDEA doesn't have.\r\n\r\nWe ran into other things for DataCleaner, but those are the ones I remember best. We ended up with these two formatters:\r\nhttps://github.com/datacleaner/DataCleaner/blob/master/Formatter-Eclipse.xml\r\nhttps://github.com/datacleaner/DataCleaner/blob/master/Formatter-IDEA.xml\r\n\r\nThey're not perfect (and I don't think they can be, unless the Eclipse and IDEA folks sit together and decide to make the formatters compatible), but they're reasonable. Most files has no changes when formatted by one and then the other, and for those that does is usually only a line or two.\r\n\r\n(If we end up using this as a \"format everything\" commit, can we make sure to squash it, and make _very_ clear in the commit message that there's no functional changes in it (and of course make sure that's true.).

I would also argue that it's less important in many places, e.g. test code and such. For me it is a perfectly fine thing to just take on a code review basis.\r\n* Maximum argument count is an annoying type of check IMO. Especially when building immutable classes that often take a lot of constructor arguments. And I like immutability much more than checkstyle :-) So I would vote against such a check.\r\n* Method and class complexity rules I also dislike. I've seen too many cases where I felt that it made the code more complex to split it into tons of private methods and stuff like that.

Of course, we should still settle on sane defaults, so it doesn't really end the discussion, but apparently there's different needs and expectations. To me, the default should always be keeping the correct type. When we're getting the tools we need with METAMODEL-192/METAMODEL-193, we should try to uphold type consistency.
