Unfortunately Google's ImmutableMap doesn't support null for a value (which we use).

We are removing indexes that are duplicate to the primary key. In some tables there  are 2 such indexes.\n\n> > > > > > > > >  did you execute some evaluation to see which fields were being most used to create an index for them? \n> > > > > > > > >     For instance, why did you create an index for the field called \"type\" of table \"op_it_work\"\n\nYes we did. Our prod DB has 1 mil+ VMs and volumes and 20K+ accounts. We started seeing degradation in simple list calls. We reviewed and analyzed all MySQL slow queries to see if any of them use full table scans. So far we found 7 cases where extra index could help. Altogether these changes reduced the load on Mysql by 30% (it doesn't spend time any more constantly doing full table scans) and improved some API calls by up to 200%. \n\n> > > > > > > > >   This will remove from the projection the VMs already removed. Aren't they needed\n\nWe analyzed both the code and other DB tables. account_vmstats_view is only used in account_view and only in the join using these clauses\n        LEFT JOIN `account_vmstats_view` `runningvm` ON (((`account`.`id` = `runningvm`.`account_id`)\n            AND (`runningvm`.`state` = 'Running'))))\n        LEFT JOIN `account_vmstats_view` `stoppedvm` ON (((`account`.`id` = `stoppedvm`.`account_id`)  AND (`stoppedvm`.`state` = 'Stopped'))))\nSince only Running and Stopped VMs used there is no need to bring Expunged one into the vmstats view. This changes alone improve listAccounts call retrieval from 11 sec to 3 ( x4 improvement).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/208121230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/208159074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1410#issuecomment-208159074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1410","id":208159074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODE1OTA3NA==","user":{"login":"ustcweizhou","id":3204966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDQ5NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3204966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou","html_url":"https://github.com/ustcweizhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T04:23:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T04:23:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alexandrelimassantana volumeTO has setting of volume I/O throttling. it is different with volTO.\nplease have a look at storageMgr.setVolumeObjectTOThrottling.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/208159074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/208176655","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1331#issuecomment-208176655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1331","id":208176655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODE3NjY1NQ==","user":{"login":"syed","id":55854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed","html_url":"https://github.com/syed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-11T06:03:41Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T06:04:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner Updated the comment as a javadoc.\n\nFor the test.

It seems like filtering them at the time a `Map` is created would make things simpler overall (i.e. no need to check that every value retrieved is not `null`.  Using Guava, you can filter a map cleanly as follows:\n\n```\n   final ImmutableMap<String, Object> copy = ImmutableMap.of(Maps.filterValues(map, \n       new Predicate<Object>() {\n           apply(final Object input) {\n               return input != null;\n           }\n       })\n   );\n```\n\nThis type of operation seems like it would be useful across CloudStack.

my understand is there was a FindBugs issue originally.  In the process of fixing the issue, some logic was changed to introduce an issue.  This commit is to revert to the original code that had the FindBugs issue.  I guess it is a lesser of two evils.  If this goes in, I think we should do what @DaanHoogland suggested and up the number of findbugs to account for the known findbug issues in this commit.  This way we are not spammed with findbugs issues and if other commits have findbugs issues, we are correctly notified.
