But the problem is some companies use the current or old version of skywalking, and they active the authentication, but their oap cluster cannot receive log. To fix it, these comany only have to deploy additional oap node to receive the log.\r\n> \r\n> As I mentioned, we could accept PR to fix this issue, but in the right way. The codes you are showing are not. This thing should be done by shade or some standard mechanism, rather than using strange reflection.\r\n\r\nWell, I had tried to solve this issue in common way, but failed... like followed code\r\n\r\n```java\r\nGRPCLogReportServiceClient\r\n\r\nchannel = ManagedChannelBuilder\r\n            .forAddress(\r\n                ToolkitConfig.Plugin.Toolkit.Log.GRPC.Reporter.SERVER_HOST,\r\n                ToolkitConfig.Plugin.Toolkit.Log.GRPC.Reporter.SERVER_PORT\r\n            )\r\n            .usePlaintext()\r\n            .build();\r\n\r\n        // decorate the channel with authentication\r\n        AuthenticationDecorator authenticationDecorator = new AuthenticationDecorator();\r\n        Channel decoratedChannel = authenticationDecorator.build(channel);\r\n\r\n        asyncStub = LogReportServiceGrpc.newStub(decoratedChannel)\r\n                                        .withMaxOutboundMessageSize(\r\n                                            ToolkitConfig.Plugin.Toolkit.Log.GRPC.Reporter.MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt complied error. \"不兼容的类型: io.grpc.ManagedChannel无法转换为org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.grpc.Channel\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI checked the \"apm-toolkit-logging-common\" module and found it inherit \"apm-agent-core\" from it's parent module \"apm-toolkit-activation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason why complied error is that when complied \"GRPCLogReportServiceClient\", it used shaded \"apm-agent-core\" package, and \"AuthenticationDecorator\" build method parameter class have already been changend to  \"org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.grpc.Channel\" because of shade plugin. So when pass \"io.grpc.ManagedChannel\" to \"AuthenticationDecorator\" in \"GRPCLogReportServiceClient\", it complies error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I used the java reflection to cheat the compiler to complie success. And when maven shade worked on \"apm-toolkit-logging-common\" later on maven package lifecycle , the class import will be changed, so in the java runtime will not occure error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe we can merge \"apm-toolkit-activation\" module into \"apm-agent-core\" module, so that it will looks \"standard mechanism\" like you said. But it will break the module development traditional....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to \" by shade or some standard mechanism\" in a elegant way really  confuse me a lot, I'd appreciate a little direction from you.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/862164901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/862167505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6664#issuecomment-862167505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6664","id":862167505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MjE2NzUwNQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-16T08:34:52Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T08:35:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The easy answer is, you should make sure the dependency codes are shaded. `org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.grpc.Channel` should be used in the compiled reporter plugin.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/862167505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/862180093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6664#issuecomment-862180093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6664","id":862180093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MjE4MDA5Mw==","user":{"login":"zhyyu","id":22634485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjM0NDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22634485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhyyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhyyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-16T08:53:22Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T08:53:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The easy answer is, you should make sure the dependency codes are shaded. `org.apache.skywalking.apm.dependencies.io.grpc.Channel` should be used in the compiled reporter plugin.\r\n\r\nWhat's \"compiled reporter plugin\"?.
