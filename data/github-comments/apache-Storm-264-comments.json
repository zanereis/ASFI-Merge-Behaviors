Any comments/concern pls feel free to let us know. Btw, I just send the latest code to you via email.

I think that the best way to go about incorporating your changes is to create a JIRA with summary along the lines \"Kafka Spout Improvements/Fixes\", and in the description put the contents you pasted above. We can then create a pull request with the suggested changes, and after it is reviewed, merge it into master. \r\n\r\nIt may not be a non trivial merge because other users have already found and fixed some bugs on the code, so likely your suggested fix has a different base commit. Furthermore, one has to evaluate how to safely add your suggested fixes on top of other fixes, which apparently are currently working. There is also a [refactoring](https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1832) of the spout going on, which will also add more diffs, so we have to take everything into consideration.\r\n\r\n@jianbzhou I suggest the following: Can you please create the JIRA, or if you don't have the permissions to do so, please let me know, and I can do it. Then, you can either we can attach your patch to the JIRA, or create a pull request with commit header that matches the JIRA summary. That will link the pull request with the JIRA. If you decide to attach the patch, or even the file with the java source to the JIRA, I will create the pull request.\r\n\r\n@jianbzhou do you consider adopting a community version which may potentially include only part of your fixes, and have other fixes committed by other contributors. Or would you rather run in your production environment the version that you currently have ?\r\n\r\n@erikdw \"you\" would be \"me\" :).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270414976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270457134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1793#issuecomment-270457134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1793","id":270457134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQ1NzEzNA==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T19:05:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T19:05:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@harshach the issue is that when there are lots of supervisors the load placed on the KDC is a lot higher than it is for a similar number of Hadoop nodes.  Each new Login will contact the KDC and fetch a new TGT followed by a new service ticket.  If we can reuse the Subject then the TGT and the service tickets can be reused too reducing the load on the KDC.  The Login handles the life cycle of the Subject, creates it and destroys it, so we wanted to cache it at that level to avoid issues there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270457134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
