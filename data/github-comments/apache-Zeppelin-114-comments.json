Each paragraph downloads for about 70 MB of data and unpack it then. They might have finished by timeout. In this case you don't have the `/tmp/flights98.csv` file at all. A added a recomendation to the notebook to increase `shell.command.timeout.millisecs` setting. It helped in my case.\r\n* We can't store data sets in \"home\" folder because `%sh` and `%flink` may be run by different users. So they may have different home folders. The `/tmp/` folder is a common folder which normally can be accessed by each user. For the case of limited access I've added `chmod 666 /tmp/flights<YY>.csv` command for each *csv* set. Maybe there is a better solution for this issue. I will be glad to receive any suggestions :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267353502/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267354885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1769#issuecomment-267354885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1769","id":267354885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzM1NDg4NQ==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T15:25:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T15:25:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the contribution.\r\nCould you check CI build failure?

Later, T1 tries to obtain locks on paragraphs of other notes as part of status update. If scheduler starts running another note using a different thread,  this sequence will result in deadlock.\r\nT1 -> locks N1.paragraphs ,  needs to obtain N2.paragraphs as part of broadcastUpdateNotebookJobInfo\r\nT2-> locks N2.paragraphs ,  needs to obtain N1.paragraphs as part of broadcastUpdateNotebookJobInfo\r\nT1 is waiting for N2.paragraphs holding lock on N1.paragraphs.\r\nT2 is waiting for N1.paragraphs holding lock on N2.paragraphs\r\n\r\n## Explanation for FIx\r\n\r\nThe mutual exclusion for runAll is maintained by synchronizing the method instead of synchronizing on paragraph. \r\n\r\nThe paragraphs are obtained via getParagraphs()  which creates a copy of paragraphs in a synchronized block\r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n\r\nThe fix is tested manually.\r\nThe deadlock does not occur anymore.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267769503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/267769928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1769#issuecomment-267769928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1769","id":267769928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzc2OTkyOA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-17T15:53:03Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T15:53:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks
