Thanks for review.\r\n1. I have created [INFRA-17133](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-17133) ticket, but then I've noticed that INFRA can't allow write access for 3d party ([Apache Arrow + CircleCI](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-15964?focusedCommentId=16351422&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16351422)). So here are two ways:\r\n* merge it and CircleCI builds will work for Drill forks only.\r\n* try to help INFRA to solve this issue via configuring CircleCI webhooks [[link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-12197?focusedCommentId=15652850&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15652850)]\r\n\r\n   I think we can try the second way, but even just to merge .circleci to the Drill will be useful for the forks \r\n   of committers and contributors, like in the Apache Cassandra [[link](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/tree/trunk/.circleci)].\r\n   I will post this question to our community to decide.\r\n\r\n2. The status badge for README.md could be added once CirlceCI will be enabled for Drill.  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6789\r\n\r\n3. The ticket for caching already exists [DRILL-6780](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6780). There are also other future enhancements in [DRILL-6741](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6741), but even without them current Circle build runs faster with more tests than in Travis

Instead of computing values like is2ndPhase from the OperatorPhase object within HashAgg, we can make the values a property of the OperatorPhase itself.\r\n\r\nIt also helps reduce the number of variables present in HashAgg template from these three\r\n\r\n```\r\n  private boolean isTwoPhase = false;\r\n  private boolean is2ndPhase = false;\t\r\n  private boolean is1stPhase = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto just a single operatorPhase variable. \r\n\r\nThis is useful when we move the code in HashAggTemplate into separate HashAggPartition, PartitionEviction, and HashAggMemoryCalculator classes since it minimizes the number of variables that need to be passed to these classes. This change was done in preparation for that restructuring.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I could change the names from `operatorPhase.isSecondPhase()` to something like this `phase.is2nd()`. Similarly I could change the line you pointed out from `popConfig.getAggPhase().isSecondPhase()` to two separate lines like\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperatorPhase phase = popConfig.getAggPhase();\r\nphase.is2nd()\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know your

@oleg-zinovev, Is it make sence to move these two dependencies to the root pom?\r\n\r\n@vvysotskyi, it isn't make sence at all, so i remove this dependencies.\r\n\r\nI try to build Drill with fresh JDK 11 and fix new errors:\r\n1) JMockit 1.39 -> 1.43. JMockit had an issue with java 11 (https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1/issues/534), so I had to update this dependecy. Starting JMockit 1.42, \"-javaagent\" must be specified to run tests (http://jmockit.github.io/tutorial/Introduction.html#runningTests) and jmockit.integration.junit4.JMockit.class was removed. That's why i have to change this tests:\r\n- TestCastFunctions.java\r\n- TestConstantFolding.java\r\n- TestDateConversions.java\r\n- TestDateFunctions.java\r\n- TestExtendedTypes.java\r\n- TestUtf8SupportInQueryString.java\r\n- AvroFormatTest.java\r\n2) BoundsCheckingTest.java fails with IllegalAccessException. This was fixed by adding a call of setAccessible(true).\r\n3) JDKClassCompiler.java - Java 11 intoduces 'Nests' (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/181), and resulting byte-code, generated by javac 11 requires a \"Nests\" support from ASM visitors. Since Drill supports java 1.8+ i simply add a target and source version to javac call, to not have to change ASM visitors.\r\n4) hadoop 2.7.1 -> 2.7.4. Haboop org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell class in version 2.7.1 contains a Java version check:\r\n`System.getProperty(\"java.version\").substring(0, 3).compareTo(\"1.7\") >= 0;`\r\nBut, for jdk 11 (at least for OpenJDK Ubuntu package), System.getProperty(\"java.version\") return \"11\", and substring call fails. I had to update hadoop to minimal version, which not contains this call.\r\n5) TestImpersonationMetadata.java - in hadoop 2.7.4 error message was changed, so i slightly change a \"expected\" error to fit both new and old messages.\r\n6) maven-source-plugin fails to execute \"jar-no-fork\" on JDK 11, and i update it to the latest version. \r\n\r\nNow on java 11 fails:\r\n1) HBase tests\r\n2) Hive test\r\n\r\nI will try to update a HBase and revalidate drill on JDK 9 and JDK 10 to the end of the week.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am sorry for possible mistakes because of my bad English","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/432165721/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/432639139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1510#issuecomment-432639139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1510","id":432639139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjYzOTEzOQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-24T12:42:11Z","updated_at":"2018-10-24T12:42:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/432639139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/433153656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1511#issuecomment-433153656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1511","id":433153656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzE1MzY1Ng==","user":{"login":"kimbostrom","id":22601938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAxOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22601938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom","html_url":"https://github.com/kimbostrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimbostrom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T18:16:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T18:16:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Edit for Ashwin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/433153656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/433198635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1511#issuecomment-433198635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1511","id":433198635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzE5ODYzNQ==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-25T20:42:55Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T20:42:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kimbostrom  could you add a corresponding JIRA as a prefix in the title of the pull request?
