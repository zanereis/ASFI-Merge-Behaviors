The most visible improvement is the dropping of `permit.jdk9.builds` flag. Now we can compile with JDK8+ and always get the same result (except maybe few modules where we continue to use `bootclasspath` and the `--release 8` API isn't enforced).\r\n\r\n>  I noticed some changes to `build.xml` files, which add `release=\"8\" target=\"1.8\" ` - on JDK 9+ target is not necessary, as release substitutes it. I would expect target to default to 8 on JDK 8, so this feels like a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe `release` flag is ignored on JDK8, so I am specifying both `release` and `target`. It feels safer to be explicit than to rely on some defaults. Anyway the outcome is important - and that's what is verified by the commit validation  `ValidateClassFilesTest`.\r\n\r\n>  Why is `javac.default.target` overriden to `1.8`, instead of relying on the default behavior in `nbbuild/templates/common.xml` - there the default target is initialized to `javac.source`, which sounds sane to me?\r\n\r\n@lkishalmi  [decided we want our modules to use JDK8](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r134fbdcee2583ceffab545827a260a2a8983a77a00c3bcec06271a3c%40%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E) whenever there is a [clash between the `javac.target` and the used API](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r42038bdaa1f66e44f20bc4f22482e8a246e8e28e61b6f5c2e92b837c%40%3Cdev.netbeans.apache.org%3E). One option to achieve that is to set source and target explicitly to `1.8` in all such modules. The other option was to make sure the default for NetBeans is `1.8`. Laszlo wrote _\"let the past go\"_, so I decided to go with the second option. \r\n\r\n>  There are adjustments to `javac.target` but not `javac.source`. This I don't understand - is the intention here to allow javac to generate more modern code, that uses features only present on Java 8+, but not suffer from code incompatibilites by using old source parser/behavior?\r\n\r\nThe value of `javac.target` influences not just generated bytecode, but also the API one compiles against (via the `--release` flag).

And for me using JDK 11 and build with release 8 sounds like a valid idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/790963054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/791267713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2788#issuecomment-791267713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2788","id":791267713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTI2NzcxMw==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T08:51:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T08:51:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @dbalek it looks like #2766 is causing a [sigtest failure](https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/netbeans/jobs/487518703#L9412)\r\n\r\n```\r\nClass org.netbeans.modules.gsf.testrunner.ui.api.TestMethodController$TestMethod\r\n\r\n  \"E5.4 - Removing constructor\" : constructor public org.netbeans.modules.gsf.testrunner.ui.api.TestMethodController$TestMethod.init(org.netbeans.spi.project.SingleMethod,javax.swing.text.Position,javax.swing.text.Position)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Not sure how you want to handle?

Another reason was to avoid accidental dependencies on nb-javac enhancements. If we start to compile against JDK 15's javac, we will loose both parts of this verification. By itself it does not necessarily mean it will stop to work on e.g. JDK 11, but much less checks will be performed.\r\n\r\nFrankly, the more I think about this, the more I wonder if we don't want to simply drop running on JDK 15 (and then eventually 16) without nb-javac. The user experience running on JDK 11 without nb-javac leaves a lot to be desired, it is difficult to test, etc. Maybe just being transparent, and saying that we need a fairly up-to-date javac, either in JDK or using nb-javac would be better. And would help us avoid tons of reflective hacks. Not sure I agree this would cement a dependency on the GPLv2+CPE library (more) - we already depend on it pretty hard. Frankly, as is my long-standing opinion, I think it would be both technically better and better user experience to ship nb-javac (of some form) with NetBeans.
