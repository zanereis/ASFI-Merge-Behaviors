Also I was unhappy with the DirectoryFactory relationship with Directory... I couldn't simply delegate close because the API is rather custom.  Could be improved.  If we wanted to rate limit, this could be explored more.\r\n\r\nI briefly toyed with BackupRepository constructor & close having this mechanism.  But I don't see that we actually close BackupRespository ?!  Also there are simple use-cases like listing backups and deleting and other things that are not heavy and don't want to hold a permit.\r\n\r\nA colleague named Gilles expressed concern that a \"restore\" should not wait in line like a backup; it's relatively rare and done in emergencies.  I think this is a good point, but I'd still want a similar mechanism described here to limit it somehow.  Maybe we have separate permit calls (backup vs restore).  And maybe a simple default implementation in which we track that restores are in progress.  If a backup gets a permit but sees restores in progress, it gives it up immediately, waits, and then tries again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1609850426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1609909574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1321#issuecomment-1609909574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1321","id":1609909574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5f9UVG","user":{"login":"colvinco","id":51863265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODYzMjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51863265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco","html_url":"https://github.com/colvinco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-27T17:03:24Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T17:03:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Based

But I do get your point.  For a _very naive_ backup client that might choose to bombard Solr with backup requests, they would all be accepted and be using threads within Solr waiting for a very long time.  I suppose a way to wrestle with this decision is to consider what a backup invoking daemon  should do to do its job _well_ (not naively).  I imagine a cron/timer that loops over all collections to back them up.  One-at-a-time would take poor advantage of resources, but we could imagine a client that uses a Semaphore with permits equal to the number of nodes * a rough number simultaneous backups desired.  Backup of a collection would grab a number of permits equal to its shard count, limited by the maximum chosen for the Semaphore.  The POC here protects against what a backup client can't possibly protect against -- a collection with way more shards than there are nodes.  By the way -- that's really rare as far as Solr use-cases out there, so the POC is motivated by providing a simple solution to something rare.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to handle the naive/abuse case better though.  It wouldn't be hard to fail the backup if the number of waiters on the Semaphore in this POC is very large (> 100?). Yes it's possible for a partial backup to fail but that's okay.  Simple protection vs absolute efficiency / guarantee.\r\n\r\nI already provided an option for prioritizing restores over backups -- which doesn't seem to favor an \"early\" vs \"late\" design.

My understanding is all other operations at the collection API level will be on hold.\r\n\r\nI don't think throttling should be done at the cost of blocking most of the threads.

Thanks for starting us on this! I took a brief look at the scan output and notices some things that I'd like to make sure we're able to do before moving forward on the PR. I tried to look for answers in the docs, but didn't see how to make the appropriate configurations, so I'm coming back to you.\r\n\r\n1. We need to be able to exclude certain paths. For example, I don't think we're interested in the javascript scan results for `solr/webapp/web/libs/*` as that is all third party code that we don't intend to change.\r\n2. Is there a way to mark certain methods as returning sanitized inputs? There are some very long taint analysis chains provided by CodeQL which is awesome, but some of them seem to miss that a value becomes safe at some point.\r\n3. Is there a way to run this or similar analysis locally for developers? We have tried very hard in the past to avoid \"surprises\" in PRs where the developer runs into a failing check but has no way to verify that they've actually solved it other than to keep resubmitting their PR. It tends to lead to some bad experiences for contributors which we tend to care quite a bit about.\r\n4. Who will the report be visible to? Project members?

Is there a way to mark certain methods as returning sanitized inputs? There are some very long taint analysis chains provided by CodeQL which is awesome, but some of them seem to miss that a value becomes safe at some point.\r\n\r\nThat is what we call \"Sanitizers\". You are welcome to contribute to https://github.com/github/codeql or open a [False Positive Issue](https://github.com/github/codeql/issues/new?assignees=&labels=false-positive&projects=&template=ql--false-positive.md&title=False+positive) so we can take a look and improve the query!\r\n\r\n> 3. Is there a way to run this or similar analysis locally for developers? We have tried very hard in the past to avoid \"surprises\" in PRs where the developer runs into a failing check but has no way to verify that they've actually solved it other than to keep resubmitting their PR. It tends to lead to some bad experiences for contributors which we tend to care quite a bit about.\r\n\r\nThat would be technically possible, but not comfortable for the PR author IMO. The [pull request alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests#viewing-an-alert-on-your-pull-request) should be easily actionable so the author knows what to do, and when they succeeded fixing the alert.\r\n\r\n> 4. Who will the report be visible to? Project members? Everybody?\r\n\r\nThe alerts will be visible in the `Security` tab of the repository for those with at least `write` access to the repository and [security managers](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1614818391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1614825404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1738#issuecomment-1614825404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1738","id":1614825404,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5gQEe8","user":{"login":"gerlowskija","id":9030708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzA3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9030708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija","html_url":"https://github.com/gerlowskija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerlowskija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-30T15:32:36Z","updated_at":"2023-06-30T15:32:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I am so thankful you are a wizard with the Jersey stuff\r\n\r\nHaha, thanks - but I swear I'm just one or two frantic google-searches ahead of everyone else haha!\r\n\r\n> would it be possible to log the body of the request as well?\r\n\r\nI definitely want to log out the body of POST and PUT requests, but I'm still figuring out how to make that work.\r\n\r\nThe main hurdle is that Jersey filters have access to the request body as an InputStream, but since the logging filter in this PR is a \"response filter\" that runs _after_ the API method, that InputStream has already been consumed and is mostly useless.  The workaround for this is to have something cache whatever POJO the request body is deserialized into, so that it's accessible by the logging filter, but I haven't found a non-hacky way to do that yet.\r\n\r\nThat's the main issue, though there are a few others (e.g. do we want to try to extend `logParamsList` in some way to cover potentially nested request bodies?).

Both of those concerns seem to merit a bit more time in review IMO, so I'm going to keep it in a separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1622248285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1622262118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1754#issuecomment-1622262118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1754","id":1622262118,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5gscFm","user":{"login":"justinrsweeney","id":25032688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDMyNjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25032688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney","html_url":"https://github.com/justinrsweeney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinrsweeney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T18:24:33Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T18:24:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@patsonluk Can you include updates to CHANGES.txt for this Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16860 in the 9.3.0 section?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1622262118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1622291276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1754#issuecomment-1622291276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1754","id":1622291276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5gsjNM","user":{"login":"patsonluk","id":2895902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2895902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk","html_url":"https://github.com/patsonluk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patsonluk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T18:47:13Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T18:47:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @patsonluk Can you include updates to CHANGES.txt for this Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16860 in the 9.3.0 section?\r\n\r\nAh thank you for the reminder!
