and @ibuenros I found the issue.\n\nIt seems that in Typesafe's Config library the `.conf` files actually allow you to express the config in JSON format (according to the documentation on their Github page it actually uses a JSON superset called HOCON https://github.com/typesafehub/config#using-hocon-the-json-superset).\n\nHOCON provides multiple ways of writing valid JSON (check the documentation link for examples). One such way is using the dot-notation. So a config such as `my.test.config=30` will actually be converted to\n\n```\n{\n  \"my\" : {\n    \"test\" : {\n      \"config\" : \"30\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe reason that this is problematic is that if you have the following two lines in your config file:\n\n```\nmetrics.reporting.kafka.topic=MetricReport\nmetrics.reporting.kafka.topic.events=GobblinTrackingEvent\n```\n\nThen the resulting config is:\n\n```\n{\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"reporting\": {\n      \"kafka\": {\n        \"topic\": {\n          \"events\": \"GobblinTrackingEvent\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMy understanding is that you the first config sets a node in the JSON tree to `MetricReport`, but then the second config over-writes that node to `{\"events\" : \"GobblinTrackingEvent\"}`.\n\nThis is exactly the bug that I was hitting when testing this on Nertz. No metrics were being reported because the code could not find the name of the Kafka topic to report to. What happens is that `GobblinMetrics.startMetricsReporting` takes in a `Properties` object. So we have to use `YarnHelixUtils.configToProperties` to convert a `Config` object to a `Properties` object. The method uses `Config.entrySet` to get all the configs in the `Config` object. It seems as though `entrySet` will only return the leaf values of the JSON tree, so the resulting `Properties` object has nothing set for `metrics.reporting.kafka.topic`.\n\nIs this behavior expected? Do we know of a way around this? This seems very different from how `gobblin.configuration.State` works, so it seems we could easily hit this issue with other config keys?\n\nFor now I can unblock this PR, because it seems the `gobblin-metrics` uses 3 config keys for reporting data to Kafka `metrics.reporting.kafka.topic.metrics`, `metrics.reporting.kafka.topic.events`, and `metrics.reporting.kafka.topic`. The last value is used as the default if either of the other two are not set. So we can still get things to work, but I still think we should discuss this on Monday.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/164329421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/164517491","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/523#issuecomment-164517491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/523","id":164517491,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDUxNzQ5MQ==","user":{"login":"liyinan926","id":3709137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDkxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926","html_url":"https://github.com/liyinan926","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyinan926/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T18:25:17Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T18:25:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

updated based on comments and offline discussion\n- Created a new utility class called `ConfigUtils` with a method `propertiesToConfig` which transforms a `Properties` object to a `Config` object and checks that no two keys are prefixes of each other (turns out the typesafe library already has an easy way of doing the check)\n- Restored all usages of the `Config` object\n- Moved usage of `rateUnit` and `durationUnit` to `MetricReportReporter` which is where it is specified in the builder\n- The constructors for `KafkaReporter` and `OutputStreamReporter` now take in a `Builder` and `Config` object - I decided to leave the `Builder` parameter as removing it would require too much re-factoring and this PR is already
