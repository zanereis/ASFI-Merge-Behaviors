I am concerned about performance impact by grouping all splits in a single reader (essentially, not parallelizing at all).\r\nWondering if it is possible to do this way:\r\nDuring planning, in HiveScan,  if it is text file and has header/footer, get the number of rows to skip. Read the header/footer rows and based on that, adjust the first/last split and offset within them. The splits which have only header/footer rows can be removed from inputSplits. In HiveSubScan, change hiveReadEntry to be a list (one entry for each split). Add an entry in hiveReadEntry, numRowsToSkip (or offsetToStart) which can be passed to the recordReaders in getBatch for each subScan. This is fairly complicated and I am sure I might be missing some details :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/345606632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/345726337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1030#issuecomment-345726337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1030","id":345726337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTcyNjMzNw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-20T15:17:49Z","updated_at":"2017-11-20T15:17:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ppadma performance impact will be only on those tables that have skip header / footer functionality (one reader per file), for other tables processing will be the same (one reader per input). Currently for tables that have skip header / footer functionality and have multiple input splits, these rows are skipped for each input, thus leaving user with incorrect data set.\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggestion, as I have mentioned in my previous comment (please see links to the code there as well) we use hadoop reader for the data and don't have information about number of rows in input split (I wish we did, it would make life much easier). \r\n\r\nI have an idea how to parallelize readers when we have only header (though still all readers will be on the same node) but when we have footer we'll have to read one file per reader.  Also we can consider Drill text reader usage instead of hadoop one (as we do for parquet files).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I suggest we commit these changes and create new Jira for future improvement of skip header / footer performance.

Change the `src-min-noconflict` directory to reflect the name of the library, whose files it contains. e.g. `aceJs`\r\n3. Remove any non-mandatory files, e.g. `snippets` directory doesn't seems to be a requirement for the library. This would help in maintaining future updates to the library or debugging.

Let's think about this a bit.\r\n\r\nIn a production system, we do want the grace period; it is an essential part of the graceful shutdown procedure.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we are doing a non-graceful shutdown, the grace is unneeded.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the cluster contains only one node (as in most unit tests), there is nothing to wait for, so the grace period is not needed. The same is true in an embedded Drillbit for Sqlline.\r\n\r\nSo, can we provide a solution that handles these cases rather than simply turning off the grace period always?\r\n\r\nIf using the local cluster coordinator, say, then no grace is needed. If using ZK, but there is only one Drillbit, no grace is needed. (There is a race condition, but may be OK.)\r\n\r\nOr, if we detect we are embedded, no grace period.\r\n\r\nThen, also, if we are doing a graceful shutdown, we need the grace. But, if we are doing a \"classic\" shutdown, no grace is needed.\r\n\r\nThe result should be that the grace period is used only in production servers, only when doing a graceful shutdown.\r\n\r\nThere are probably some details to simplify, but I hope the above communicates the idea.

The copier is used in multiple locations, some of which include selection vectors. Sort uses a copier to merge rows coming from multiple sorted batches. The SVR compresses out SVs. A filter will produce an SV2 which the SVR removes. An in-memory sort produces an SV4. But, because of the ways plans are generated, the hash join will never see a batch with an SV. (An SVR will be inserted, if needed, to remove the SV.)\r\n\r\n2. We never write a batch using an SV. The SV is always a source indirection. Because we do indirection on the source side (and vectors are append only), there can be no SV on the destination side.\r\n\r\nNote also that the {{VectorContainer}} class, despite it's API, knows nothing about SVs. The SV is tacked on separately by the {{RecordBatch}}. (This is a less-than-ideal design, but it is how things work at present.) FWIW, the test-oriented {{RowSet}} abstractions came about as wrappers around both the {{VectorContainer}} and SV to provide a unified view.\r\n\r\nBecause of how we do SVs, you'll need three copy methods: one for no SV, one for an SV2 and another for an SV4.\r\n\r\nIn the fullness of time, the new \"column reader\" and \"column writer\" abstractions will hide all this stuff, but it will take time before those tools come online.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/348008225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/348031701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1024#issuecomment-348031701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1024","id":348031701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODAzMTcwMQ==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-29T23:28:53Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T23:28:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@laurentgo \r\nI've added server-triggered timeout tests and made other changes as well, but they require support for [DRILL-5973](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-5973) .

We discussed 3, but it felt like 4 was more appropriate since some methods didn't fit well in some of the contexts.\r\n\r\n- **ExecutorFragmentContext**: This is the highest level context that exposes access to everything. This is used by the FragmentExecutor and is also passed to the BatchCreators and RootCreators. \r\n- **RootFragmentContext**: This is exposed to the root executors. It has a few methods only needed by the root, but doesn't have access to everything like the ExecutorFragmentContext.\r\n- **ExchangeFragmentContext**: This contains the network functions, and is used by the senders and recievers.\r\n- **FragmentContext**: This is the barebones context which has no network functions and only exposes the bare minimum needed by operators.\r\n\r\nThese contexts are interfaces that inherit each other in the following way:\r\n\r\nExecutorFragmentContext <- RootFragmentContext <- ExchangeFragmentContext <- FragmentContext\r\n\r\nThere is only one implementation of the interfaces **FragmentContextImpl**.
