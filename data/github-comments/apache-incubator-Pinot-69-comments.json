@suvodeep-pyne, thanks again for your feedback! And sorry for the late response.\r\nFor each of your questions:\r\n\r\n> I assume that the online worker must be on when such an API request is issued? What is the behavior if that is not the case?\r\n\r\nYes. The online worker must be on. If that is not the case, the endpoint will timeout during the polling task status stage and then return a failed response back to users.\r\n\r\n> I wanted to understand the necessity of having 2 TaskDrivers. How is an online TaskDriver different in behavior than an offline task driver? Same question for online detection task vs offline detection task.\r\n\r\nThere are some unique states needed to be maintained by the online driver. Here are some main differences:\r\n* When task driver is acquiring a waiting task, an online task driver should not pick a task created by web app (Similar for the web app driver). Different task drivers will pick different tasks based on the task type (DETECTION or DETECTION_ONLINE).\r\n* Online task driver will not retrieve detection config from DB. Instead, it retrieves config from task info. Please check this [comment](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5769#discussion_r463312439) for the reason.\r\n* Online task driver will have two extra ThirdEye metrics: `duration counter` and `tasks counter`\r\n\r\n> Is this about prioritizing online tasks? If yes, have we considered having a priority attached to a task?\r\n\r\nCurrently, no priority is attached. But we do want to have that in the future. I guess providing dedicated priority algorithms is another topic and a little bit out of the scope of my current intern project given the limited time so I didn't support that now. But I think we should do that in the future.\r\n\r\nI will keep in mind about your suggestions on readability. They are really practical. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThanks again for your feedback!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/670657377/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/670664334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5818#issuecomment-670664334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5818","id":670664334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MDY2NDMzNA==","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-07T19:02:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T19:02:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm seeing this error in quickstart ci:\r\n```\r\n***** Launch data ingestion job to build index segment for baseballStats and push to controller *****\r\n##[error]Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to create IngestionJobRunner instance for class -

The preview tool's purpose is to show the user the anomalies it would have generated on historical data, so that the user can visualize the detection configuration and decide whether it behaves correctly for the user's specific use case (what is an anomaly to them?).  In the case of an existing alert, it shows the new anomalies as compared to those saved in the database (the actual anomalies that were generated by the alert in the past).  So the user can decide if the new detection configuration would perform better or worse than the alert's older detection configuration (i.e. Does it omit the false positives and/or detect the false negatives? Does the new detection still detect true positives?  Does it detect false positives that the old config didn't?).  \r\n\r\nThe Alert Overview's role is to show the detection as configured with the historical anomalies overlaid on it.

Why? Because the goal of Jersey Resource class is provide a binding from a url to a java method. So for example, `RootResource` implies `/`, `ThirdEyeResource` inside `RootResource` implies the path `/thirdeye`, etc. That way you have a clear hierarchy in the code as to how the urls are set up. There are still anomalies in the code like `DetectionAlertResource` which is hosted at `/groups` which is really difficult to correlate.\r\n\r\nGrouping business logic can be done in 2 ways.\r\n- Documentation level: Use Swagger tags to group a set of APIs together. We already do this.\r\n- Code Level: Have core logic classes which hold the business logic instead of the Resource classes. This resources can delegate calls to these core logic classes.\r\n\r\nI agree with your idea to have a way of grouping things into bins like detection, RCA, etc. We should do this in our business logic. However, keeping all the business logic in Jersey Resource classes is not the best approach as the codebase grows. Also, it gets messy when you need to share logic in one Resource with another.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/671486383/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/671498383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5832#issuecomment-671498383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5832","id":671498383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTQ5ODM4Mw==","user":{"login":"mayankshriv","id":12615885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjE1ODg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12615885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankshriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankshriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-10T17:53:08Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T17:53:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> can we chain the operations?\r\n> \r\n> `diff(union($1, $2), union($3, $4)) `\r\n\r\nYes, the PR should already support this. @bkuang88 could you add a test for this, if one doesn't already exist?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/671498383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/671551128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/5588#issuecomment-671551128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5588","id":671551128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTU1MTEyOA==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-10T19:43:51Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T19:43:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"More comments after using recent version:\r\n1.

I haven't made pinot build succeed from jdk 9, but runtime should be fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/672728402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/672845582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5818#issuecomment-672845582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5818","id":672845582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Mjg0NTU4Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T12:38:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T12:38:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for the fast turnaround and the help fixing the branch to make it work @fx19880617 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/672845582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/673003546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5438#issuecomment-673003546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5438","id":673003546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MzAwMzU0Ng==","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-12T17:16:53Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T17:16:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fx19880617 i've resolved the merge conflicts on this one. could you take a look again?\r\n@KKcorps i had to change the ScalarTransformFunctionWrapper constructor.
