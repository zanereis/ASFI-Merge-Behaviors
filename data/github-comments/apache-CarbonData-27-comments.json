: This problem will get reproduce in a multi node system where a single Load will create multiple carbon data file is by multiple tasks. I have tested the code changes in a multi node cluster with large data and output ic coming correctly. \r\nAnother problem observed while testing is choosing the correct cardinality of the new segment formed due to compaction. Previously we used to copy the last segment cardinality to the new compacted segment. But with IUD features updates can run on any segments and in case the updates happens on any intermediate segments then there is high probability that cardinality of that segment will be more than the last segment. So now instead of copying the cardinality from the last segment we calculate the highest cardinility values from all the segments.

Because here the data may not be sorted always, Only for the first column of dimensions is sorted naturally because of mdk order.\nAnd if the data is sorted explicitly(it means it has inverted index) then it goes to another method setFilterdIndexToBitSetWithColumnIndex. So here we need extra checks to do binary search in the method setFilterdIndexToBitSet , that is like whether the column is naturally sorted or not.This information we may need get from store.\nPlease use this Range binary search in 'setFilterdIndexToBitSetWithColumnIndex' as well.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/comments/284677569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/comments/284681509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/carbondata/pull/628#issuecomment-284681509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/628","id":284681509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDY4MTUwOQ==","user":{"login":"ravipesala","id":8134086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzQwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8134086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala","html_url":"https://github.com/ravipesala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravipesala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-07T10:23:50Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T10:23:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lionelcao Thank you for working on this,\r\nBut there are some differences in files from `CarbonFilters` of spark-common package and spark2 package.

those are the 2 cases we can do binary search on dimension.\r\n\r\nRegarding question1 , no it does not create inverted index if the data is already sorted(naturally sorted).\r\n\r\nRegarding question2, it is an issue pending from long time, it requires changes from data writer and as well as data reader to update the sort state.  \r\nThere are attributes like SortState and Encoders in DataChunk of format needs to updated properly while writing and get them back while reading to know the dimension has inverted_index or not, or it is naturally sorted or not. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is don't change the method of  `setFilterdIndexToBitSet` as the old logic is required for no_inverted index and non sorted columns. Update the the method `setFilterdIndexToBitSetWithColumnIndex` with your range search.  To know the dimension is naturally sorted or not we can add another PR to update the read/write logic.

I have few doubts.\r\nWhy primitive data types are supported as no-dictionary columns in this PR? It supposed to be direct dictionary.\r\nWhy date and timestamp are supported in no-dictionary, it already has direct dictionary support and it much efficient in terms of loading and query.\r\n\r\nI think the scope of this PR should be limited to following points.\r\n1. Support Sort_columns in DDL and metadata.\r\n2.  Already in old flow all columns with dictionary_include and dictionary_exclude will become sort_columns and remaining are measures . So now there would not be any measure concept now so we just make sort_columns should have sorted and rowid index, and remaining columns should not be sorted/ row index but it should have value/delta compression if it is number datatype.\r\n\r\nI feel it would have been better if we have some discussion in mailing list before starting the implementation to keep the people sync with you and it avoids unnecessary
