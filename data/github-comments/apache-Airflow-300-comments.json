The logic is still the same, but the code that does the branching evaluation has been moved into a new dependency rule inside ``ti_deps/deps/branch_dep.py``.\r\n\r\nWhen `BranchDep` is evaluated, it sets the state of a task to \"SKIPPED\" if it has a parent that decided to skip it.\r\n\r\nFor example, this comes from \"example_short_circuit_operatorschedule\":\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6637585/74024780-7eaba680-49dd-11ea-813f-09ca598e5f48.png)\r\n\r\nFor a DAG that looks like this, `condition_is_False` decided to skip `false_1`. Before this PR, the problem is if someone clears `false_1`, it'll execute. This is very counter-intuitive for users:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6637585/74024872-af8bdb80-49dd-11ea-9e53-19f4f7c844df.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6637585/74024927-caf6e680-49dd-11ea-84f6-5548e8954b1c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, when the scheduler evaluates the dependency rules for `false_1`, `BranchDep` will skip `false_1` because it knows that the parent task `condition_is_False` had already decided to skip `false_1`. In other words, this makes the \"skipped\" status \"sticky\".\r\n \r\nSo after this PR, the DAG will look like this after someone clears `false_1`. This is much more intuitive:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6637585/74024780-7eaba680-49dd-11ea-813f-09ca598e5f48.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/583347659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/583349147","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7375#issuecomment-583349147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7375","id":583349147,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzM0OTE0Nw==","user":{"login":"shcherbin","id":4647586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDc1ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4647586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin","html_url":"https://github.com/shcherbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shcherbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-07T11:21:38Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T11:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @feluelle, would you mind having another look at this PR?\r\nI admit I've initiated it a bit too early.

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the

They are copied straight from the master where the unit tests have been run and are green in CI. \r\n\r\nThere is basically no easy way - unless you want to rewrite manually all the tests - to run unit tests with back-ported operators/hooks/sensors from 2.0 in the context of Airlfow 1.10. I at least could not find any way to do it easily - but if you think you can do it easily, it would be great. I just think it is awfully lot of effort.\r\n\r\nMany of the unit tests use mocking for internal structure of packages and it would not work to convert those. \r\n\r\nAnd it would not make a lot of sense because we would just (again) test the same - behaviors of the operators - pretty much all the \"operators/hooks/sensors\" test are mocking out the communication to the external systems and test internal logic of the operators. We do not need to test it again - we know that this works. \r\n\r\nWhat we do not know if the operators are working with airflow-1.10 framework and whether the framework changes did not spoil anything. So we really need to test integration of the operators from 2.0 to 1.10 and the best we can do here is to run those (already unit-tested) operators in the context of 1.10 talking to the real system and see if they are still working there. We have a lot of such tests for GCP and we can fairly easiy test those 2.0 operators to run on top of airflow 1.10.x. Which is really what we want to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/583912240/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/583941659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7374#issuecomment-583941659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7374","id":583941659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Mzk0MTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"codenamelxl","id":9434559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzQ1NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9434559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl","html_url":"https://github.com/codenamelxl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenamelxl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T03:36:17Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T03:36:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Can you add a new test or update the ground_truth_dag with access_control\r\n\r\n\"access_control\" added to ground_truth_dag.

There seem to be two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It seems that when you do not create a Workgroup on AWS, the default name is called `primary` rather than `default`. This is what the [AWS Docs say](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-procedure.html):\r\n\r\n>  default, if you have not created any workgroups, all queries in your account run in the primary workgroup\r\n\r\n2. Even after setting the `workgroup` parameter to `primary`, the AWSAthenaOperator did not work for us and failed with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnknown parameter in input: \"Workgroup\", must be one of: QueryString, ClientRequestToken, QueryExecutionContext, ResultConfiguration, WorkGroup\r\n```\r\nIt turns out that the correct parameter to use is actually called `WorkGroup` as opposed to `Workgroup` which the code currently uses (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6871/files#diff-a5011c8e96e573b3c2a951d1450bd9eaR78).\r\n\r\nIf you think it may make sense, I'll be happy to send a PR that should fix both of these issues. Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nJust for the sake of completeness (and because I assume a few more people may run into this), we now use the following custom `AWSAthenaOperator`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.contrib.operators.aws_athena_operator import AWSAthenaOperator\r\nfrom airflow.contrib.hooks.aws_athena_hook import AWSAthenaHook\r\n\r\n\r\nclass CustomAWSAthenaOperator(AWSAthenaOperator):\r\n    # Monkey patch the workgroup because the default is 'primary' for us, not\r\n    # 'default' as Airflow uses\r\n    # https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6871\r\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        self.workgroup = 'primary'\r\n\r\n    def execute(self, context):\r\n        self.hook = self.get_hook()\r\n\r\n        self.query_execution_context['Database'] = self.database\r\n        self.result_configuration['OutputLocation'] = self.output_location\r\n\r\n        conn = self.hook.get_conn()\r\n\r\n        self.res = conn.start_query_execution(QueryString=self.query, # noqa\r\n                                              ClientRequestToken=self.client_request_token, # noqa\r\n                                              QueryExecutionContext=self.query_execution_context, # noqa\r\n                                              ResultConfiguration=self.result_configuration, # noqa\r\n                                              WorkGroup=self.workgroup) # noqa\r\n\r\n        self.query_execution_id = self.res['QueryExecutionId']\r\n        query_status = self.hook.poll_query_status(self.query_execution_id,\r\n                                                   self.max_tries)\r\n\r\n        if query_status in AWSAthenaHook.FAILURE_STATES:\r\n            error_message = self.hook.get_state_change_reason(self.query_execution_id) # noqa\r\n            raise Exception(\r\n                'Final state of Athena job is {}, query_execution_id is {}. Error: {}' # noqa\r\n                .format(query_status, self.query_execution_id, error_message))\r\n        elif not query_status or query_status in AWSAthenaHook.INTERMEDIATE_STATES:  # noqa\r\n            raise Exception(\r\n                'Final state of Athena job is {}. '\r\n                'Max tries of poll status exceeded, query_execution_id is {}.'\r\n                .format(query_status, self.query_execution_id))\r\n\r\n        return self.query_execution_id\r\n```\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n> I think for now its enough - once we have a basic framework for running the system tests (and some credits provided by Google Cloud/AWS/Azure) we might revisit that and add more tests for that.\r\n\r\n@potiuk I just wanted to second that this framework would be a great addition to the testing pipeline, as issues like the ones we've encountered here might get to surface much earlier. Is there any way I can help with that?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/584066252/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/584082902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7393#issuecomment-584082902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7393","id":584082902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDA4MjkwMg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T11:40:44Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T11:40:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We need to merge that quickly to stop people from failing their prs","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/584082902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/584093459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7393#issuecomment-584093459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7393","id":584093459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDA5MzQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-10T12:11:53Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T12:11:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Wouldn't it be better to add this to the .travis.yml directly?\r\n> \r\n> `before_install` for example?\r\n> \r\n> Because locally it does not occur, right?

As far as I can see, you're right about the problems with the default workgroup name and the \"WorkGroup\" parameter.

on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community! If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/docs/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/584409286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/584488896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7396#issuecomment-584488896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/7396","id":584488896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDQ4ODg5Ng==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-11T06:00:30Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T06:00:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#7396](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/commit/1e00243014382d4cb7152ca7c5011b97cbd733b0?src=pr&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `0.14%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #7396      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n- Coverage    86.6%   86.46%   -0.15%     \n==========================================\n  Files         873      873              \n  Lines       40725    40725              \n==========================================\n- Hits        35271    35213      -58     \n- Misses       5454     5512      +58\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/executors/celery\\_executor.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9leGVjdXRvcnMvY2VsZXJ5X2V4ZWN1dG9yLnB5) | `50.67% <0%> (-37.84%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| [airflow/executors/base\\_executor.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9leGVjdXRvcnMvYmFzZV9leGVjdXRvci5weQ==) | `93.58% <0%> (-2.57%)` | :arrow_down: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/airflow/pull/7396?src=pr&el=footer).
