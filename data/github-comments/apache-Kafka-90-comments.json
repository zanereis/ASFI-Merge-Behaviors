Then users can interpret these differentiated cases themselves, for example:\n1. return with the previously read value: for example, for a monitoring UI, you'd prefer `stale` values than a red-flagged `N/A`.\n2. block-and-retry: this is when `stale` value is not acceptable, and users would rather wait than reporting an old value.\n3. etc.\n\nIn Kafka Consumer, we are actually NOT differentiating these two cases but introduce a wait timeout on `poll` / etc functions. However, for Kafka Streams, since rebalance can take long time and since the library is, in fact, exposing the rebalances throw hosted tasks anyways I feel it is actually not the right path to follow. Instead, could we still differentiate these two cases but in a slightly different manner:\n1. Introduce a sentinel `StreamsMetadata` indicating \"information not available\" instead of throwing `StreamsException` and `InvalidStateStoreException`; and users getting this value should handle themselves following the above possible options.\n2. Still throw `InvalidStateStoreException` in `getXXX` calls in `readableStoreYYY`, but with a different exception message indicating that \"the state store may have migrated to another instance\", instead of \"it is not (re)-initialized yet\"; and users should handle this by going back to step 1) in order to re-discover the instance hosting the store.\n\nNote that this is small change compared with using exceptions in step 1) to differentiate \"information not available\" from \"it is null\", but I feel it is easier for users to interpret. If you agree, we can proceed and make the changes in this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/246521133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/246527042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1845#issuecomment-246527042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1845","id":246527042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjUyNzA0Mg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T23:25:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T23:25:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also

It's certainly possible (from the protocol level) to join the group with an empty subscription, but it's difficult to see the value of it since it ensures that no partitions will be assigned and we'll block in poll() until the timeout elapses. It seems more likely that an empty subscription/assignment indicates an error, so raising is probably the appropriate action. Use cases where a subscription can become empty are probably rare and it would be easy to restructure the code to avoid the poll() in that case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/246583172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/246600461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1707#issuecomment-246600461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1707","id":246600461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjYwMDQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"kawamuray","id":2255161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2255161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray","html_url":"https://github.com/kawamuray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kawamuray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-13T07:38:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T07:38:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Updated PR based on your suggestion.\n9c24e2d is a commit which implements your idea but let me explain about this new patch a bit as I had to make an unexpected modification 64ec2ec to accomplish the purpose.\n\nI modified the test code like this: https://gist.github.com/kawamuray/fdfcfec85f179417c3a2d4866f055df5 and ran against 9c24e2d then the result was look like below:\n\n```\n./bin/kafka-run-class.sh -Dlog4j.configuration=file:./log4j.properties -Dretry.backoff.ms=5000 KafkaProducerMetadataUpdateDurationTest\n...\n[2016-09-13 16:07:53,676] INFO Kafka version : 0.10.1.0-SNAPSHOT (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser)\n[2016-09-13 16:07:53,676] INFO Kafka commitId : 9c24e2d4025e5170 (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser)\n[2016-09-13 16:07:53,679] DEBUG Initialize connection to node -1 for sending metadata request (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)\n[2016-09-13 16:07:53,679] DEBUG Initiating connection to node -1 at HOST-1:9022.

NetworkClient initiates connection to all brokers before sending the first metadata request.\n\nI digged into DefaultMetadataUpdater and found that [timeToNextReconnectAttempt](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/NetworkClient.java#L542) is causing this.\n\nThe cause of problem 1 is that DefaultMetadataUpdater updates `lastNoNodeAvailableMs` even when a connection is being established to a broker, which leads `retry.backoff.ms` interval among each `maybeUpdate()`.\nThe cause of problem 2 is that DefaultMetadataUpdater is not waiting a connection being established to a broker in the previous loop. By changing `maybeUpdate()` to wait a connection being established properly, maybeUpdate() is no longar riskly to call in tight loop so we can let each loop of maybeUpdate() to try checking connection availability for sending metadata request.\n\nAfter appling 64ec2ec, the experiment result look like this:\n\n```\n./bin/kafka-run-class.sh -Dlog4j.configuration=file:./log4j.properties -Dretry.backoff.ms=5000 KafkaProducerMetadataUpdateDurationTest\n...\n[2016-09-13 16:25:18,526] INFO Kafka version : 0.10.1.0-SNAPSHOT (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser)\n[2016-09-13 16:25:18,526] INFO Kafka commitId : 8cd55d2a465e3b0a (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser)\n[2016-09-13 16:25:18,528] DEBUG Initialize connection to node -1 for sending metadata request (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)\n[2016-09-13 16:25:18,528] DEBUG Initiating connection to node -1 at HOST-1:9022.

Will you able to take a look?\n\nSome context on the patch. The current expiration mechanism is based on the muted partitions in the `RecordAccumulator`, if a batch has sit in the accumulator for some time and there is no in flight batch for that partition, we will expire the batch. This behavior is introduced in KAFKA-3388( #1056 ). The issue is that when metadata update happens, we will not send any other request in that send loop, so no partition will be muted and thus are exposed to expiration in that send loop even though they can still make progress. This caused our mirror maker to shutdown from time to time. The fix is to let the expiration check base on the metadata freshness. If the metadata is fresh and the leader is known, we don't expire a batch. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/246864591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/246867386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1852#issuecomment-246867386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1852","id":246867386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Njg2NzM4Ng==","user":{"login":"becketqin","id":5778611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5778611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin","html_url":"https://github.com/becketqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-14T00:16:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T00:16:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrao @hachikuji @ijuma Would you able to take a look?
