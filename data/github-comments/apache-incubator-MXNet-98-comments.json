\nI was going to look into modifying embedding-inl.h Let me know if you are doing something similar along this line. \n\nWell here's the issue, currently the mx.sym.Embedding layer does not account for PAD symbols. So when a, out-of-range index is given to the mx.sym.Embedding layer, it returns a non-initialized vector. What is needed is for the Embedding layer to return an all zero vector, and for the backpropagation to ignore training on the LSTMs when there's a PAD from the embedding layer.\n\nWe can use ignore_label for the softmaxoutputs, but there's currently nothing for the inputs...\n\nThe current bucketing tutorial from @pluskid uses zeros. But the embedding layer treats that zero as any other symbol, and will include backpropagating the gradient to the embedding vector representing the zero or PAD.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237321640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/237323717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/2909#issuecomment-237323717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2909","id":237323717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzMyMzcxNw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T18:20:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T00:38:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Somehow the commit history is messed up.
