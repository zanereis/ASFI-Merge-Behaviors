If so I might be able to help out. Writing embedded RabbitMQ tests can be quite tricky, but there might be a couple of workarounds:\r\n\r\n1. Use apache qpid embedded broker and make sure that it's configured to use AMQP 0.9.x. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41552549/398441) stackoverflow answer.\r\n1. Use something like [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to start RabbitMQ as a Docker container. This requires that Docker is installed on the build server though and I have no insight into this? Also the test suite will be slower since the Docker image needs to be pulled.\r\n1. Use [embedded rabbitmq](https://github.com/AlejandroRivera/embedded-rabbitmq) which downloads an entire RabbitMQ installation when starting the test case. If Docker is not available on the build server this might be a better alternative but it'll also slow down the test significantly (at least when building from scratch) due do downloading of RabbitMQ. \r\n\r\nWDYT?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/341972660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/341991139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1729#issuecomment-341991139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1729","id":341991139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTk5MTEzOQ==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-05T17:44:10Z","updated_at":"2017-11-05T17:44:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I still don't understand why a `RabbitMqIO` is necessary in general, as opposed to using `AmqpIO` pointed at the RabbitMQ endpoint?
