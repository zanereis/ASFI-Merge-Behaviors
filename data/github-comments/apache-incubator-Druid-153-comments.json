I will also ask other Druid members to share their thought on `Granularity` dimension b/c  its an important metric for our use-case but might not be true for everyone.\r\nI also realized some of the dimension e.g `dimensionCardinality`, `addProcessedRows` are not emitted by default and could be emitted using custom extensions. My proposal is to control what to include/exclude via config rather than creating custom extensions. \r\n\r\nConfig based approach could be:\r\n1. Emit everything by default and a have blacklist config to determine dimensions to exclude.\r\n2. Emit legacy metrics/dims by default and have a allowedList config  to determine new metric/dimensions to include. Release a list of new dimensions/metrics in the release note so that people can include new query metrics if they want to.\r\n\r\nConfig based approach has some advantages:\r\n1.

I considered \"config\" approach from the very beginning _instead of QueryMetrics_. In fact it was already questioned in the original PR, see https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3954#issuecomment-288829851, And I chosen `QueryMetrics` (call it \"interface\" approach) because \"config\" approach is not agile enough:\r\n\r\n - with \"config\" it's not possible to support the variety dimension and metric forms you may want to emit, e. g. different time resolution for time metrics (default now is milliseconds, and we in fact switched to nanoseconds).\r\n - you cannot skip computations, that are needed to produce some metrics and/or dimensions, that might be significant. See https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3954#issuecomment-288829851, `QueryMetrics.makeBitmapResultFactory()`\r\n - Dimensions and metrics are not independent, some may want to emit different set to dimensions for different metrics -- would be very cumbersome to setup a system allowing to config all possible combinations via properties.\r\n\r\nSo the complexity of the configs needed is very high, it's much harder to refactor them than code, while this system is still fundamentally much more restricted than \"interface\" approach.\r\n\r\n> Users don't have to develop/maintain custom extensions to emit metrics but they can still control what metrics they want.\r\n\r\nI understand that you don't want to do this but it's just what you need to do, if you want custom metrics and/or dimensions. It was clear when `QueryMetrics` was added and it's the foundation of it's mechanism, that I mentioned in this thread already: notification about changes via API change => your extension build breakage.\r\n\r\n> Adding/removing query metrics will be easier.\r\n\r\nHow this statement is supported?\r\n\r\n1. (config) Add a configuration, add documentation for it, add parsing of this configuration, add if-else or other ad-hoc logic to check this configuration throughout the code.\r\n\r\n2. (interface) Add a method to QueryMetrics, add empty implementation in DefaultQueryMetrics, use the new method in already set up locations with a QueryMetrics object in hand (the entire point of #4184 and successors)\r\n\r\nWhy the first is easier?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/318515748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/318515862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4433#issuecomment-318515862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4433","id":318515862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODUxNTg2Mg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T23:38:04Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T23:38:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @gianm is Task interface not marked as extension point consciously or just missed ? I know at least one user who have written their own task.\r\n\r\nI consciously didn't add Task because it's not listed on http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/modules.html.

In addition, Lookup APIs are explicitly described as \"experimental\" in the docs, so I think they shouldn't be annotated as stable.

One of the major problems for using BufferArrayGrouper for merge is the cardinality of the grouping key across segments cannot be acquired. One possible solution is computing the cardinality additionally while doing aggregation. It means, when performing per-segment query execution, hash values of the grouping key are collected using HyperLogLogCollector in the responseContext. When historicals or brokers merge partial aggregation results, they can use the collector to estimate the approximate cardinality. Even though there are some challenges like additional overhead for cardinality estimation (about additional 15% overhead in the benchmark) and approximate cardinality may cause buffer overflow if the actual cardinality is greater than the approximate one.\r\n\r\nWe could collect statistics like this ahead of time, and then there's minimal overhead during the queries. For example, we can collect HLLCs for string columns and min/max values for int columns. These could even be stored in the segments themselves.\r\n\r\n> If this solution or any better idea is acceptable, BufferArrayGrouper should have the KeyType parameter to be used by SpillingGrouper or ConcurrentGrouper without huge code duplication.

caveat, we do *not* have queries quite like this in production, so this is speculation)\r\n\r\nCouple of things to note:\r\n\r\nYour first name + last name is not really an identifier. You have some underlying information you are hiding (unique identifier) whose property is a first name and last name. Unless you really are trying to sum the purchase amounts of all people who have a first and a last name (and no other name of record) which happens to equal the tuple `(\"james\", \"smith\")`, you might want to consider finding a way to store the underlying data with the events, and consider things like first and last name as metadata about the \"real\" event data (unique id) that needs to be handled either at ingestion time through ETL, or query time with QTL.\r\n\r\nLets look at the case where there's really a unique ID underneath, and you want information related to the unique ID.\r\n\r\nFor the total purchase amount, it becomes pretty straight forward. You simply sum the total purchase amount by the unique ID. This becomes more complex if you have something like \"was on premium plan\" or similar. In such a case the state of the \"plan\" is also related to the purchase item, and becomes much more complex to analyze. You should be able to look at a particular user ID, and look at the different plans each user ID was on, and do the purchase amounts that way if such a calculation is needed (or look at the different plans and look at the user IDs per plan).\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a state accumulation, you are going to have a very odd time in Druid due to the eventual consistency nature of the data store. But let's say for the sake of argument that its OK and you have some time to make sure the state is consistent. In such a scenario it should be possible to process a \"sign_up\" event as a 1 and a \"deactivate\" as a 4, then if you add them together by unique ID you should get 5. If you do not get 5 hopefully you get 1. If you don't get a 5 or a 1 then you hopefully have a 0 (never seen) or else have a problem (duplicate or error events). If you allow for repeat signups you can either have new user IDs or come up with something more complex.\r\n\r\nState transitions (unknown --> signup --> inactive) are something that have been asked about before, but I don't know of any particular group that has attempted to solve it in Druid.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319263667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319305172","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4619#issuecomment-319305172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4619","id":319305172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTMwNTE3Mg==","user":{"login":"dclim","id":11050882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDUwODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11050882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim","html_url":"https://github.com/dclim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dclim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T08:32:48Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T08:32:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Committed a revision with somewhat more invasive behavioral changes to the following:\r\n- Change the blacklist period to begin from when a task failure triggers the blacklisting and not after the last task on the worker completes\r\n- If there are tasks running on a worker when it is blacklisted, if any of those tasks complete with SUCCESS the worker is removed from the blacklist\r\n- A worker removed from the blacklist will have its consecutive failure counter reset and will not immediately be re-blacklisted on the next failure\r\n- If a worker is removed from the cluster and this causes the number of blacklisted workers to exceed the max blacklist percentage, workers will be removed from the blacklist to bring us back below the maximum\r\n- Overlord console now reports a `blacklistedUntil` timestamp for workers\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319305172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319315964","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4617#issuecomment-319315964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4617","id":319315964,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTMxNTk2NA==","user":{"login":"DaimonPl","id":9693936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2OTM5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9693936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl","html_url":"https://github.com/DaimonPl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaimonPl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T09:16:35Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T09:16:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm maybe you have some ideas about this one?

wonder if we should change the direction of the conversation.  One sad thing that we ran into and only just found out is that we've always wanted to have metrics emitted that represent the number of rows scanned.  In looking into this, it looks like that has actually been implemented because there is a metric method added for that, but the actual code implementation isn't anywhere to be seen so we're not able to take advantage of the work someone else has already done.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe we need to discuss when we think a metric or dimension should be in the default, core set and when it shouldn't.  If we have that conversation, then the question becomes whether or not \"granularity\" should be a dimension included on all query metrics that have a granularity.\r\n\r\nI tend to think that including granularity isn't a big deal (you will get a lot more cardinality from the id or the segment ids) and it provides a nice level of drill down that can help when trying to understand the performance profile.  What are your concerns with adding it to the core set of dimensions?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319438996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319439244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4605#issuecomment-319439244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4605","id":319439244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTQzOTI0NA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T17:26:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T17:26:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"defaulting to DOUBLE means various UI clients that depend on segment metadata query would need to be upgraded before druid upgrades.\r\ne.g. our ui sends segmentMetadata queries and suddenly started getting `DOUBLE` columns that it couldn't understand and started failing.\r\n\r\nso, for 0.11.0, i would also agree for defaulting doubleXXX aggregators to old behavior of storing `FLOAT` columns and provide a way to opt-in to get them to store `DOUBLE` column.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319439244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/319453467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4480#issuecomment-319453467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4480","id":319453467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTQ1MzQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T18:17:57Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T18:17:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@a2l007 https://github.com/metamx/server-metrics/pull/33 can you peek at that one?

question.\r\n\r\nWhat did the btree implementation look like? Was it hooked into Druid at all or did you do it as a separate thing? Was it reading from mmapped something into java.lang.Strings, like Druid would?\r\n\r\nWhat I remember from looking at profiles is that when reading dimension data, a big chunk of the time is spent decoding UTF8 into java.lang.String. It could be cached but is not by default (see `druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes`).\r\n\r\nI was also considering that for some cases (like the Scan or Select queries) we could improve throughput by doing these operations in chunks. So we could read 1000 rows from a dimension column and then go and lookup all the names later. CPU cache behavior should be better, and also we may save some UTF-8 decodes if the 1000 rows have fewer than 1000 unique values. This can work even if the column-cache from `druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes` is disabled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320059328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320059555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4641#issuecomment-320059555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4641","id":320059555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDA1OTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-03T18:57:11Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T18:57:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think adding another (optional) section to Druid string columns is good if it's going to give a benefit.

In which situations would segments be merged? Only in a Merge Task or any hadoop index task or only in re-indexing tasks? Is it correct to assume that \"indexing\" is something that only happens during the ingestion of data, so it is not happening on broker/historical, right? To my understanding, \"indexing\" is the creation of an index which would happen only during the ingestion of data, but then again, in the query phase, segments get scanned and segments contain indexes and they get merged and there are merge buffers, so I was wondering whether \"segment merging during indexing\" only refers to the index creation in the ingestion phase or also something that happens during query processing? I think its the first but I'm insecure...\r\n- \"fuzzy parameter meant to account for the decompression and dictionary merging buffers\"\r\nPrior to this phrase, the documentation mentions \"merge buffers\" but I got the feeling that \"dictionary merge buffers\" are yet something else. If so, it would be great to get a brief explanation of what they are and where they come into play (historicals? / brokers? etc) \r\n- \"Indexing workers and historical\"\r\nI've been working with Druid for 18 months now but I'm still insecure about the use of the term \"Indexing\" as the documentation as a whole _explains_ terms like overlord/middlemanager/peons/realtime nodes but then _uses_ terms like \"indexing service\" or \"indexing workers\" and I don't know what exactly how these notions connect. What exactly is meant by \"Indexing workers\" in this case? Does it mean Peons/Middlemanagers? Other documentation also sometimes talks of \"indexing service\" in which case I'm not sure if \"indexing service\" is the short form of \"Kafka Indexing service\" or if \"indexing-service\" == overlord+middlemanagers+peons or if Indexing service == realtime nodes... I do feel that I understand all concepts and moving parts of Druid, it's just the terminology itself that throws me. A reoccuring pattern is that I read about similar terms and don't know if they are synonymous or not. \r\n- Below the newly added documentation, there is a section that says\r\n\"Larger values allow for more aggregations in a single pass over the data while smaller values can require more passes depending on the query that is being executed\"\r\nHow can I tell whether Druid is needing several passes over the data? To my understanding, in order to achieve top performance, Druid should be doing only a single pass over the data. Therefore, I would like to make the processsing buffers sufficiently large such that for all query scenarios that can occur on my particular cluster, all query processing would be done in a single-pass fashion. So how can I tell whether that is actually happening? Lets say I have a testsuite covering all query scenarios over my particular dataset. How can I measure how many passes Druid ends up taking given my current memory settings? There is a segment scan time metric and if it is too high, that might indicate several passes, but thats just a fuzzy measure. Is there a way to read off how many passes were taken? Is this being logged or emitted as a metric?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320125585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320138125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4641#issuecomment-320138125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4641","id":320138125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDEzODEyNQ==","user":{"login":"weijietong","id":728692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODY5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong","html_url":"https://github.com/weijietong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weijietong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T02:15:00Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T05:40:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gianm thanks for response.\r\n\r\n Actually I have done the profile and tuned the codes with the methods what you mentioned before. Yes, the profile shows that string decode and GenericIndex.get is the hot bottleneck. I ever fetched the dictionary string bytes directly out from the mapped ByteBuffer without decoding.This will send the pure bytes to the front end console.But no noticeable performance gains. Chunk operations also been tried. I first cached a batch of (row number --> dictionary idÔºâpairs,then batch looked up the dictionary values. The performance gains was also not noticeable.\r\n\r\nI think the reason is that batched dictionary ids may cross different cpu cache blocks. To a high cardinality dimension column , looking up the dictionary value is a randomized seeking operation not sequential reading(I think sequential reading is the key point why metric columns perform so good , it will leverage the CPU prefetched data ,no cache switch ). The parquet project also adopts the dictionary encoding.But it divides the rows  into separate row groups --> chunks--> pages ,each page's column data size is CPU cache friendly by using dictionary encoding. But this method may not apply to Druid ,as Druid needs a global dictionary to a segment to do the filter operation(Of cause ,maybe we can have some other tricks to solve it .welcome to discuss that).\r\n\r\nI do the exercises out of the Druid by using the jdbm3 project. One column a btree, using the mmap too . Once we got the filtered bitmap(meaning selected row numbers),we just need to browse the matched btree leaf nodes(notice that browse method,not get) . The underneath operation is sequential reading linked dimension values. If we add this additional storage format ,the option strategy is indeed need, as user will pay for the additional disk storage space.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320138125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320167668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4648#issuecomment-320167668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4648","id":320167668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDE2NzY2OA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T06:29:04Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T06:29:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please fix the build failure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320167668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/320229703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4631#issuecomment-320229703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4631","id":320229703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDIyOTcwMw==","user":{"login":"kaijianding","id":8663725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjM3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8663725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding","html_url":"https://github.com/kaijianding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaijianding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T11:50:38Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T11:50:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leventov Maybe it's not the best place to raise my question on processing threads configuration, but it's kind of related.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the number of processing threads are tied to the usage of directly memory.

The number of processing thread is limited due to the memory ls limited (like 16g or 32g per jvm).\r\nIn my druid cluster, most queries are timeseries and groupby v2 query, the cpu usage is very low but sometimes the scan pending is high which means there aren't enough processing threads and queries have to wait.

for the report @erikdubbelboer!\r\n\r\nThis is related to the LoadQueuePeon changes from https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3736.\r\n\r\nThese logs would be generated every 50ms for each historical node that's currently loading segments.\r\n\r\nI'm moving this issue to 0.11.0 since the related changes were introduced in 0.10.0 and the excessive logs, while troublesome, aren't a
