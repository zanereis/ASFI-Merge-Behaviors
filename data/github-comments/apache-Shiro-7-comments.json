Otherwise, they can \"see\" a previous one.\r\n\r\nAnd that's exactly what happens in our tests. We set initially a security manager, then we destroy it and set another one for the rest of the time. A few minutes later, a thread does `new Subject.Builder().sessionCreationEnabled(false).sessionId(shiroSessionId).buildSubject()` which blows up with a

I don't think there is anything here that can/needs to be improved.\r\n\r\nThere is however a pain point that I see also [others have hit before](http://shiro-user.582556.n2.nabble.com/Inheritance-of-Security-Context-causes-problems-in-EJB-container-td7579859.html) - using an `InheritableThreadLocal` instead of a \"normal\" `ThreadLocal`. In addition to what the people in that thread explain as problems, another thing to note is that once such a threadpool thread stores the SecurityManager in its thread local storage, it will be such forever - even if the global static SecurityManager is changed, the threadpool threads are bound forever to the old one which could lead to nasty situations. I believe this has to be revisited and perhaps an option to be added for Shiro to use \"normal\" ThreadLocal's instead of inheritable-ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/622083516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/622088034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/57#issuecomment-622088034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/57","id":622088034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjA4ODAzNA==","user":{"login":"mookkiah","id":8975264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NzUyNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8975264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah","html_url":"https://github.com/mookkiah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mookkiah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-30T20:20:31Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T20:20:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@fpapon Created new PR #219 after resolving merge conflict.\r\n@col-panic I agree that we can block IP using infrastructure solution like nginx.
