Also, I think we can provide a stronger user experience as an S3-specific field, helping users either ignore the field or pick an appropriate Signer class without Googling for it.  Specifically,\n- Provide the currently supported class names as examples in the description text, or\n- Present the options in a drop-down list of the S3 signers.  Something similar came up in another PR with respect to server-side encryption and enforcing signature v4, and I think a list like \"Default Signature\", \"Signature v4\", \"Signature v2\", would be nice.  No, this isn't required, but it seems like a nice extra for usability (via extra work for you, I admit it's feature

yup, it's complaining because when you \"rebase\" you are re-writing history.

Change of default behavior\n\nI'm worrying about the effect of existing data-flows. Since there's no guarantee that nobody has taken advantage of the original behavior intentionally, I would prefer to add a new Processor property to enable this feature, such as 'Enable Repeating Capture Groups: true/false', in order to keep current configuation intact.\n\n### 2. Processor documentation\n\nThe commit doesn't update the processor description, but there's a sentence which goes\n\n> If the Regular Expression matches more than once, only the first match will be used.\n\nThis should be updated at least.\n\n### 3. Test case to clarify behavior\n\nI was wondering what if multiple capturing groups are specified, and that regex can be repeated.  Are you interested in adding following test-case? Perhaps, additional documentation on how the repeated capture groups are stored with indexed attribute names would be helpful, too.\n\n``` Java\n    @Test\n    public void testFindAllPair() throws Exception {\n        final TestRunner testRunner = TestRunners.newTestRunner(new ExtractText());\n        final String attributeKey = \"regex.result\";\n        testRunner.setProperty(attributeKey, \"(\\\\w+)=(\\\\d+)\");\n        testRunner.enqueue(\"a=1,b=10,c=100\".getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n        testRunner.run();\n        testRunner.assertAllFlowFilesTransferred(ExtractText.REL_MATCH, 1);\n        final MockFlowFile out = testRunner.getFlowFilesForRelationship(ExtractText.REL_MATCH).get(0);\n        // Ensure the zero capture group is in the resultant attributes\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".0\");\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".1\");\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".2\");\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".3\");\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".4\");\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".5\");\n        out.assertAttributeExists(attributeKey + \".6\");\n        out.assertAttributeNotExists(attributeKey + \".7\"); // Ensure there's no more attributes\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey, \"a\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".0\", \"a=1\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".1\", \"a\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".2\", \"1\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".3\", \"b\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".4\", \"10\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".5\", \"c\");\n        out.assertAttributeEquals(attributeKey + \".6\", \"100\");\n
