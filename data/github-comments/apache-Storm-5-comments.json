The rule we're using on Apache Storm is patches can be merged with at least 2 +1's from committers (who didn't post the patch) and no -1's from committers. Of course, sufficient time needs to be allowed for committers to give their +1 or -1's. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612456405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612437848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/3962#issuecomment-2612437848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3962","id":2612437848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0Mzc4NDg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-02T00:21:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:39:27Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=plucas\">plucas</a>:</i>\n<p>Regarding the NullPointerException, it seems that a null tuple is being enqueued for transmission by Disruptor in this function, but I'm not familiar with the Storm code going up to have an intuition of where it might be coming from:</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<div class=\"error\"><span class=\"error\">Unable to find source-code formatter for language: clojure.</span> Available languages are: actionscript, ada, applescript, bash, c, c#, c++, cpp, css, erlang, go, groovy, haskell, html, java, javascript, js, json, lua, none, nyan, objc, perl, php, python, r, rainbow, ruby, scala, sh, sql, swift, visualbasic, xml, yaml</div><pre>(defn mk-transfer-fn [worker]\n  (let [local-tasks (-> worker :task-ids set)\nlocal-transfer (:transfer-local-fn worker)\n^DisruptorQueue transfer-queue (:transfer-queue worker)]\n    (fn [^KryoTupleSerializer serializer tuple-batch]\n      (let [local (ArrayList.)\n    remote (ArrayList.)]\n(fast-list-iter [[task tuple :as pair] tuple-batch]\n  (<span class=\"code-keyword\">if</span> (local-tasks task)\n    (.add local pair)\n    (.add remote pair)\n    ))\n(local-transfer local)\n;;
