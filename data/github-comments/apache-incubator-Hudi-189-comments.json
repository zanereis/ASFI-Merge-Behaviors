We see same data file being cleaned up by multiple clean instants. we need to understand how this could be possible. Only reason I can see this happening, if a new clean is scheduled even before previously clean is completed and hence the scheduling of new clean adds the same file to be cleaned up that previously scheduled clean will also be attempting to clean. \r\n2. We inspected the active timeline, yet to inspect the archive timeline. but from active timeline, could not decipher much except the repeated clean reported in (1). but that also does not answer why duplicates could occur. \r\n3. Do you happened to know why rollbacks are kicking in? It could happen only if there are partial write failures and the next writer will try to rollback the old failed write before starting the new write. \r\n\r\nHere are the reasons why duplicates could occur. \r\n1. If any of your writer used bulk_insert instead of upsert. \r\n2. Was there any multi writer involved at any point in time. Inserts from multiple concurrent writers could result in duplicates. \r\n3. https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#hoodiecombinebeforeupsert is set to false during \"UPSERT\" operation. Or \"INSERT\" was used which does not do de-dup by default. So, if incoming batch has duplicates, it could result in storage having duplicates as well. your 3rd use-case might fall into this likely. (where duplicates have same commit time, but diff file names)\r\n\r\nI see you are using SIMPLE index. Can you try using BLOOM index. Very unlikely index lookup has issues. just to rule that out. \r\n\r\nJust something to try out if feasible. Can you read this table and upsert to a new table and see how that pans out? Atleast after initial bootstrap, you should not see duplicates. but if you tee your incremental ingestion to both tables, does the new table result in duplicates? \r\n\r\n@prashantwason : Can you help us triage this issue please.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1004101626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1004110981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3975#issuecomment-1004110981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3975","id":1004110981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM472YSF","user":{"login":"dmenin","id":8372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzI5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin","html_url":"https://github.com/dmenin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmenin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-03T14:00:25Z","updated_at":"2022-01-03T14:00:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> \r\n\r\nHi @nsivabalan \r\n\r\n\"How is your updates/deletes spread in general? \"\r\n\r\nI have the data partitioned by year/month/day, and deal with time related data, the vast majority of the updates happen on the same partition, however, a percentage happens on different partitions (yesterday's and the days before). \r\nThis percentage gets smaller towards the end of the day. \r\n\r\nSince I get a batch of data from the source system containing \"everything that changed in the last X amount of hours (X can vary between 24 - 72 hours) at 00:10, there are a lot of updates because most of the things will refer to yesterday's partition. At 23:00 however, I would be mainly accessing the data at today's partition.\r\n\r\n\r\nregarding Indexes, first of all, none of the GLOBAL indexes perform due to the amount of data and partitions (we have data for more than 3 years - it takes a VERY long time to build the index), so I HAVE to use SIMPLE - and, by the way, this is the reason why I do a delete and upsert . -if I dont delete some records I'd end up with duplicates.\r\nI have tried with BLOOM simple but it didnt affect the performance, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n\"Disabling small files\" also didnt help - and I dont understand the logic behind changing that setting when we are just deleting data - could you elaborate on why you think that would help?\r\n\r\nregarding the MOR exploration, I found a problem where timestamp columns are not supported on the \"_rt\" tables - works fine on the \"_ro\", but on hte \"_rt\" I get a \"GENERIC_INTERNAL_ERROR: org.apache.hadoop.io.LongWritable cannot be cast to org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.TimestampWritable\" error - I am working with AWS support to fix this, they were able to reproduce the problem and have a ETA to fix in in the end of January.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I'll just take this opportunity to suggest a HUDI feature - the ability to have a \"GLOBAL\" index on a pre determined list of partitions. \r\nFor example, considering that today is the 3rd of January 2022, If I could run my upset and, in one of the parameters sauy, create the index on partitions:\r\nyear=2021/month=12/day=31\r\nyear=2022/month=1/day=1\r\nyear=2022/month=1/day=2\r\nyear=2022/month=1/day=3\r\nthat would solve my problem.

The solution is to shade and relocate aws dependencies introduced in hudi-aws:\r\n> \r\n> > For our internal hudi version, we shade aws dependencies, you can add new relocation and build a new bundle package:\r\n> > For example, to shade aws dependencies in spark, add following codes in **packaging/hudi-spark-bundle/pom.xml**\r\n> > ```\r\n> > <!-- line 185-->\r\n> > <relocation>\r\n> >  <pattern>com.amazonaws.</pattern>\r\n> >  <shadedPattern>${spark.bundle.spark.shade.prefix}com.amazonaws.</shadedPattern>\r\n> > </relocation>\r\n> > ```\r\n> \r\n> @xushiyan should this relocation be added to the official hudi release to avoid such conflicts?\r\n\r\n@kazdy Thank you! This should work.\r\n\r\nBut shall we shade all aws deps in Spark? I'm worrying about the side effict, but let me have a try before replying in #4474 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1004486507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1004507464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4474#issuecomment-1004507464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4474","id":1004507464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4735FI","user":{"login":"boneanxs","id":10115332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTE1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10115332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs","html_url":"https://github.com/boneanxs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-04T03:44:32Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T03:44:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xushiyan @zhedoubushishi , Looks this is a common case for many users, does shading this have other side effects or not?

Can you please let us know what exactly you are looking for. I am not an expert in structured streaming, but if you are looking to read from one stream and write to diff hudi tables based on some condition, here is one hacky way which I can think of.\r\n> \r\n> https://gist.github.com/nsivabalan/f7ee7fa611cfc864db7506c016a73787\r\n> \r\n> This intercepts each mirco batch from source stream and writes to hudi table. You can build upon this to have different switch cases and write to different hudi tables. But this would mean your writes are going through spark datasource write and not as streaming write.\r\n\r\n@nsivabalan ,Thanks for your reply. I want read from multiple streams and write to diff hudi tables.\r\nSuch as writing hudi from multiple Kafka sources.\r\nI know it can be done with DeltaStreamer.But I wonder if Spark Streaming can do the same.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1005488249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1005489938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4212#issuecomment-1005489938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4212","id":1005489938,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM477o8S","user":{"login":"prashantwason","id":58448203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDQ4MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58448203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason","html_url":"https://github.com/prashantwason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-05T08:47:26Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T08:47:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Responded to the comment above.
