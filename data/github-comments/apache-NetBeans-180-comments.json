I saw it at work (using Windows @work, never on Linux @home), but I still can not come up with the connecting element. Looking at the code in `NbClipboard` I see this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/f3bbe321592be090fe3c0a4ebf9a6107a3f69fcd/platform/o.n.bootstrap/src/org/netbeans/NbClipboard.java#L416-L443\r\n\r\nLine 440/441 is a hard violation of the rule \"Never catch an exception you are not prepared to handle\". \r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6428 / https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6428/commits/19816a38da2b9f03adbfbc60184f730e7e8a259e I can get this stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [org.netbeans.NbClipboard]: systemClipboard not available (2)\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: cannot open system clipboard\r\n\tat java.desktop/sun.awt.windows.WClipboard.openClipboard(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.desktop/sun.awt.datatransfer.ClipboardTransferable.<init>(ClipboardTransferable.java:77)\r\n\tat java.desktop/sun.awt.datatransfer.SunClipboard.getContents(SunClipboard.java:138)\r\n[catch] at org.netbeans.NbClipboard$GetContents.run(NbClipboard.java:427)\r\n\tat org.openide.util.RequestProcessor$Task.run(RequestProcessor.java:1420)\r\n\tat org.netbeans.modules.openide.util.GlobalLookup.execute(GlobalLookup.java:45)\r\n\tat org.openide.util.lookup.Lookups.executeWith(Lookups.java:287)\r\n\tat org.openide.util.RequestProcessor$Processor.run(RequestProcessor.java:2035)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks like a source of the problem. To make this reproducible, I'm using this JNA code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TestClipboard {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n\tSystem.out.println(User32Ex.INSTANCE.OpenClipboard(null));\r\n\ttry {\r\n\t    Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);\r\n\t} finally {\r\n\t    User32Ex.INSTANCE.CloseClipboard();\r\n\t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public static interface User32Ex extends User32 {\r\n\tUser32Ex INSTANCE = Native.load(\"user32\", User32Ex.class, W32APIOptions.DEFAULT_OPTIONS);\r\n\t\r\n\tboolean OpenClipboard(HWND hwndNewOwner);\r\n\t\r\n\tboolean CloseClipboard();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBetween the `OpenClipboard` and `CloseClipboard` calls no other application can access the windows clipboard.\r\n\r\nIt was already established, that this might be a race condition and I suspect that in the cases users can reproduce the issue some other programm does something similar as NetBeans and blocks access to the

Have added a screenshot of this to the description.\r\n\r\n> (what confused me initially was that `xev -event button | grep button` uses different button numbers than java does, so either the linux distribution or java must map them somehow)\r\n\r\nConfused me for a while with `xev` too.  I realised that X11 is mapping the mouse wheel up/down as buttons 4 & 5, so these are skipped in Java's button numbering.\r\n\r\nThink it's explained by the code at https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.desktop/unix/classes/sun/awt/X11/XWindow.java#L731  As is why we need to use the mouse pressed rather than mouse clicked events (not generated for higher numbered buttons).\r\n \r\n> btw what is the forward/back action?\r\n\r\nAn editor action, also in the editor toolbar.  Try `CTRL-click` on a method to open another method in the same or a different file.  Now try the back button (or in NB19 `ALT-LEFT`).  It's a multi-level navigation history - very useful when exploring code across multiple files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1715252021/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1715557424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4673#issuecomment-1715557424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4673","id":1715557424,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5mQVQw","user":{"login":"vindic","id":9977733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Nzc3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9977733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic","html_url":"https://github.com/vindic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vindic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-12T11:36:26Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T11:36:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"To complete the answers of this issue, in my case it was the Antivirus (Trend Micro Apex).\r\n\r\nUnloading it, and Netbeans 19 with Windows 11 is working like a charm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1715557424/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1715584192","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6428#issuecomment-1715584192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6428","id":1715584192,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5mQbzA","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-12T11:56:03Z","updated_at":"2023-09-12T11:56:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I ran my IDE with a version of this patch for 24 hours now.

That might already fix cases and maybe we are looking at an artificial problem here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1717218028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1717236604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1717236604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1717236604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5mWvN8","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-13T09:04:34Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T09:04:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> For your questions: the \"Last record repeated again\" message is an optimization from netbeans (not sure whether I agree with this):\r\n\r\nIt should be configurable though - https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/platform/core.startup/src/org/netbeans/core/startup/logging/MessagesHandler.java#L68\r\n\r\nNot tested, but I assume `-J-Dorg.netbeans.log.disableRepeatingMessagesFilter=true` will work to stop it and get accurate timestamps if any use.\r\n\r\nHowever, yes, no smoking guns in the log(s) by the look of it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1717236604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1717353827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-1717353827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":1717353827,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5mXL1j","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-13T10:19:55Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T10:19:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @eirikbakke indicates, that he hit the error path, which is fixed by the retry I inserted.\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing I still saw one instance of not being able to paste something from an external application.
