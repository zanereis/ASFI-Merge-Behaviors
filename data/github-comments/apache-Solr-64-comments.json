As expected, single connection throughput increased significantly with HTTP/2. HTTP/2 with 256 concurrent streams gave a throughput of 115 000 requests per seconds compared to 6 500 for HTTP/1.1. Increasing the number of connections from 1 to 128 increased throughput to 115 000 for HTTP/1.1, while HTTP/2 gave 125 000 with the same setup (without request multiplexing). HTTP/2 was also more efficient, with lower CPU utilization—a consequence of its compact protocol representation and header compression. **The highest throughput for HTTP/2 was observed with 4 clients and 256 concurrent streams.** This configuration resulted in 225 000 requests per seconds—roughly double the best case for HTTP/1 (128 connections). The h2load tool was CPU constrained for the single connection benchmark as it could only utilize a single CPU core per connection. Having 4 connections removed the CPU bottleneck. Increasing beyond 4 connections resulted in gradually more overhead and degraded throughput.\r\n\r\nFor them 4 clients and 256 concurrent streams gives highest throughput.\r\n\r\nWe should try to test it with different configuration and try to find the right configuration that works for us. Also, I believe, most of the Recovery code in main branch is now using HTTP2 and we can start with testing that part. \r\n\r\nNOTE :- maxConcurrentStreams is a server level

It's true that the current implementation is such that this feature has never been relevant. But it's been documented for some time, and I can see why it would be desirable. Ordinarily I'd say that removing a relatively long-standing public-facing feature would not be done lightly. This surely an unusual case though, in the sense that it has never worked as advertised.\r\n\r\nWe should definitely consider as a factor in the decision whether the feature is expected to be useful. I may not be the best advocate for the feature -- perhaps @atris or @stillalex might have opinions?\r\n\r\nThe main though I have is actually _against_ the feature -- or at least, against it as currently implemented. Basically, in most cases I suspect one would want a hard limit per type (since different request types have different performance impacts and functional impacts). So allowing slot borrowing to be only configured on the type being borrowed _from_ would allow all other requests to borrow any slot, limited only by the overall max number of borrowable requests, which is a global limit. This doesn't seem that useful to me 🤷.\r\n\r\nIf we want to enable more complex configurations, it would be more flexible (and in some ways, simpler) to support multiple `Solr-Request-Type` buckets per request, all of which must be acquired for the request to proceed. Though this could lead to some pathological configurations where a request could acquire a slot in one bucket (blocking other requests) only to be blocked themselves upon trying to acquire a slot in another bucket.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to configure a \"borrowing pool\", limiting the scope of which request types may borrow from each other. This approach would avoid the pathological configuration of the \"multiple `Solr-Request-Type`\" approach, and also avoid the \"global borrowing pool\" problem that would make the current implementation (IMO) unuseful.

I suggested a limit based on the query parser. This suggestion isn't limited to edismax; it'd include some others that users are likely to use.\r\n\r\nDid you have particular parsers in mind @dsmiley ?  Or is there somewhere else that the project relied on this \"end-user\" vs \"admin\" parser distinction, that I could get a list from?\r\n\r\nI'm on board with expanding the set of parsers that will enforce this limit, but I don't have a great sense what you or others would consider \"end-user\" parsers.  If you have a concrete subset in mind, then I'm happy to run with that.\r\n\r\n> Another angle is to employ this limit only on a TextField, which generally should be used for keyword search and thus user queries.\r\n\r\nI think I agree that \"field-type\" is a better predictor of \"user query or not\" than the query-parser would be.\r\n\r\nMaybe my experience is idiosyncratic, but prefix queries on TextField aren't the common case from what I've seen.  Anecdotally, prefix queries are much much more common on StrField.\r\n\r\nWe could apply the limit only on TextField, but if that only covers (e.g.) 20% of the prefix queries that'll hit the index - is it providing stability?  I guess it still could, if the terms dictionary was large enough.  But still, leaving the majority prefix-query use-case uncovered doesn't feel great...

I tried this PR locally using the \"techproducts\" example. I thing I noticed is that the metrics filtering appears to not work, which is a big problem. A test should be added for this, and it should work.\r\n> \r\n> http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?category=solr.jetty&wt=prometheus\r\n\r\nFiltering does work I think the parameter you are looking for is `group`. Try `localhost:8983/solr/admin/metrics?group=jvm&wt=prometheus` and you can change it with `jetty` `node` `core` for the corresponding registries\r\n\r\nBut still you are correct, I should have a test for this. Will add one in. \r\n\r\nThe only other thing I remember now about this is that `regex`, `key`, `expr` parameters for filtering will not work with this prometheus `wt`. I did that on purpose because those 3 parameters are for filtering based on the name of the metric while the others are kind of more generic such as registry or type filtering. I didn't think it made sense because prometheus naming is different from the dropwizard naming after exporting. For example: `solr\\.core\\..*:QUERY\\..*\\.requestTimes:max_ms` is not an output of prometheus but to allow `expr` filtering around that felt odd.\r\n\r\nEven then if you need extensive filtering or trying to get some specific metric, maybe the Prometheus Exporter process with a custom config might be the better solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2197554232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2197729131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2405#issuecomment-2197729131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2405","id":2197729131,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6C_q9r","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-28T22:23:58Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T22:23:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oops; maybe I was hurried.
