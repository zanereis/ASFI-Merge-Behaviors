It also now fully implements the behavior in the docs, namely sorting the data if you pass an Ordering, etc.\n\nIt looks like Aaron found a problem with the size-tracking code -- will try to fix that in ExternalAppendOnlyMap as well. Once this class is in though it could replace ExternalAppendOnlyMap in most use cases, though its one downside is that it creates another object for each key of the in-memory collection (since we have `((Int, K), C)` pairs to allow sorting by partition). Might still be worth it long-term though. On the flip side, I think the hash based merging code here is more efficient, avoiding a bunch of `ArrayBuffer.remove` calls.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49565532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49565536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1499#issuecomment-49565536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1499","id":49565536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTY1NTM2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-21T01:08:09Z","updated_at":"2014-07-21T01:08:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1499.

The application might run totally remotely, for instance, so why should the user expect that a -D set on the submission site gets packaged up and sent to the remote launcher. Also confusing is that we'd only really triage -D options that are spark properties, not other ones, so the semantics would differ depending on whether the user happened to set a java property that started with `spark`. For these reasons I feel it's better to just have an explicit config-related flag.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49570062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49570096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1292#issuecomment-49570096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1292","id":49570096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTcwMDk2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-21T03:48:11Z","updated_at":"2014-07-21T03:48:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1292.
