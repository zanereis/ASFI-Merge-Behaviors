PR is only for the public interface and there is no real implementations yet (all marked as TODOs), the Jenkins job will expect to fail so do not worry about that. Ping @jkreps @nehanarkhede @junrao @gwenshap @miguno @ewencp @ijuma @ymatsuda for reviews.\n\nA brief summary of the design:\n- We add a KWindowedTable as a third citizen in addition to KStream and KTable, which can be generated either from windowed stream-stream join or stream aggregations (which must be windowed as well). The main reasons for adding this interface are the following:\n\na. Windowed tables generated from a windowing definition cannot be directly written back to a Kafka topic: users have to decide either encode the window id into the key or value.\n\nb. We want to support a specific left join for windowed tables that allow shifting windows when joining two windowed tables, e.g. comparing the current aggregate results with history windowed aggregates a week ago.\n\nc. Stream to windowed-table join needs to be handled differently from stream to table join.\n\nAdmittedly adding this third class makes the whole DSL a bit too fat and cumbersome. So feedbacks and thoughts on tangling the above three issues in order to simplify the APIs are more than welcomed.\n- Operations that generates a KTable or KWindowedTable needs to specify a table name.\n\nThis is because for such operations we need to create a local state store with a Kafka change log, the table name will then be used as the change log topic name; this name cannot be auto-generated since topology changes may modify the ordering and hence mess up the change logs upon job restarts (we want to maintain such change logs across multiple runs so the topic names must be unique).\n\nThis might be another user burden, so better ideas are welcomed.\n- (Windowed) Aggregates on KStreams must be on the message key, while Aggregates on KTables will specify a KeySelector to select the aggregate key. We expect users to first use map() on KStreams to get the new key as the aggregate key if it was not before.\n- We define inner / outer / leftJoins, and restrict only a subset of them for KStream-KStream, KStream-KTable, KTable-KTable and KWindowedTable-KWindowedTable joins because we feel these are the most common join scenarios. Please let me know if you feel other join cases may also be common.\n\nAlso for KWindowedTable-KWindowedTable joins we requires the two tables' window definition to be the same, i.e. they must be the same window type (sliding, hopping, etc) that can be aligned (with same window boundaries).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/165565041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/165573228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/683#issuecomment-165573228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/683","id":165573228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTU3MzIyOA==","user":{"login":"granders","id":1295932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders","html_url":"https://github.com/granders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-17T20:26:13Z","updated_at":"2015-12-17T20:26:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fpj

, my test was a little bit different. And I saw interesting behavior.\nThe following code prints _true_ then _false_.\n\n```\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n        final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();\n        final Condition cond = lock.newCondition();\n        Thread t = new Thread() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                lock.lock();\n                // When interrupt() is called, the thread will not wake up, but its interrupt flag will be set.\n                cond.awaitUninterruptibly();\n                lock.unlock();\n            }\n        };\n        t.start();\n        t.interrupt();\n        // We interrupt the thread here, the thread does not wake up but the interrupted flag should be set.\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted()); // This line prints true\n        // wake up the thread after interrupt the thread.\n        lock.lock();\n        cond.signalAll();\n        // Check if the signal all clears the interrupt flag.\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted()); // this line prints false\n    }\n```\n\nThe above code means cond.signalAll() clears the interrupt flag. Notice we did not release the lock in the main thread.\n\nIf we release the lock in main thread the result becomes interesting. The following code prints _(true, false, false), (true, true, false), (true, true, true)_ randomly. \n\n```\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n        final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();\n        final Condition cond = lock.newCondition();\n        Thread t = new Thread() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                lock.lock();\n                // When interrupt() is called, the thread will not wake up, but its interrupt flag will be set.\n                cond.awaitUninterruptibly();\n                lock.unlock();\n            }\n        };\n        t.start();\n        t.interrupt();\n        // We interrupt the thread here, the thread does not wake up but the interrupted flag should be set.\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted());\n        // wake up the thread after interrupt the thread.\n        lock.lock();\n        cond.signalAll();\n        // Check if the signal all clears the interrupt flag.\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted());\n        lock.unlock();\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted());\n    }\n```\n\nThis is quite strange because the later lock.unlock() changes the result on the previous line of printing. \n\nIf we add a `Thread.sleep()` in the main thread after `lock.unlock`. The following code gives either _(true, true, false)_ or _(true, false, false)_.\n\n```\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n        final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();\n        final Condition cond = lock.newCondition();\n        Thread t = new Thread() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                lock.lock();\n                // When interrupt() is called, the thread will not wake up, but its interrupt flag will be set.\n                cond.awaitUninterruptibly();\n                lock.unlock();\n            }\n        };\n        t.start();\n        t.interrupt();\n        // We interrupt the thread here, the thread does not wake up but the interrupted flag should be set.\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted());\n        // wake up the thread after interrupt the thread.\n        lock.lock();\n        cond.signalAll();\n        // Check if the signal all clears the interrupt flag.\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted());\n        lock.unlock();\n        Thread.sleep(1);\n        System.out.println(t.isInterrupted());\n    }\n```\n\nSo it looks to me that the behavior of calling `signalAll()` after calling `interrupt()` is not deterministic.

After digging into Condition I think this is not because of some random behavior of `signalAll()` but `awaitUninterruptibly()`:\n\n```\npublic final void awaitUninterruptibly() {\n            Node node = addConditionWaiter();\n            int savedState = fullyRelease(node);\n            boolean interrupted = false;\n            while (!isOnSyncQueue(node)) {\n                LockSupport.park(this);\n                if (Thread.interrupted())\n                    interrupted = true;\n            }\n            if (acquireQueued(node, savedState) || interrupted)\n                selfInterrupt();\n        }\n```\n\nNote that it triggers `Thread.interrupted()` every time it returns from parking the thread (which may be returning at any point of time), and only re-set the flag through `selfInterrupt()` at the end of the call. \n\nSo if the call ordering is\n\n```\nt.interrupt();                            // main thread\nSystem.out.println(t.isInterrupted());    // main thread\nThread.interrupted();              // t thread\nSystem.out.println(t.isInterrupted());    // main thread\nselfInterrupt();     // t thread\n```\n\noutput is {true, false}, and if call ordering is\n\n```\nt.interrupt();                            // main thread\nThread.interrupted();              // t thread\nSystem.out.println(t.isInterrupted());    // main thread\nSystem.out.println(t.isInterrupted());    // main thread\nselfInterrupt();     // t thread\n```\n\noutput is {false, false}, and if call ordering is\n\n```\nt.interrupt();                            // main thread\nThread.interrupted();              // t thread\nselfInterrupt();     // t thread\nSystem.out.println(t.isInterrupted());    // main thread\nSystem.out.println(t.isInterrupted());    // main thread\n```\n\noutput is {true, true}. Unfortunately I did not find any better way to validate this, but I did find other functions like \"Lock.lock() / unlock(), Condition.signallAll()\" never modifies the corresponding thread's flag.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/165927195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/165928932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/660#issuecomment-165928932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/660","id":165928932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTkyODkzMg==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-19T00:53:51Z","updated_at":"2015-12-19T00:53:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So back to the original problem, it's still mysterious to me why `BlockingQueue.put` does not throw InterruptedException if the flag was not reset.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/165928932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/165929833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/689#issuecomment-165929833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/689","id":165929833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NTkyOTgzMw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-19T01:04:52Z","updated_at":"2015-12-19T01:04:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This makes a lot of sense!

reasonable overall, though it's unfortunate that GroupMetadataManager now has to depend on MetadataCache. Perhaps it's justifiable. We could even move some of the topic existence checks in KafkaApis into GroupMetadataManager, though I'm not sure that's a good idea. \n\nOne question is whether there are any compatibility concerns since we are deleting offsets prior to the expiration of the retention time which is provided in the OffsetCommitRequest? Technically commits remain fetchable currently even after a topic has been deleted, though it seems very unlikely that anyone is depending on that. But since the default retention is 24 hours, I'm wondering if there is really a strong reason to delete before then?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/166445340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/166466186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/704#issuecomment-166466186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/704","id":166466186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjQ2NjE4Ng==","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T00:28:50Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T00:28:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji I think the rationale is to try and cleanup all things that are related to a topic in any way as soon as the topic is deleted to avoid any confusion , this probably becomes more important if the topic is recreated. \n\nIf there is actually no concern around keeping this data around for 24 hours even though the source (topic itself) is deleted we can just close the jira as won't fix and I am fine with that approach too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/166466186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/166467381","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/687#issuecomment-166467381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/687","id":166467381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjQ2NzM4MQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-22T00:38:45Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T00:38:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp fixed the issues mentioned above.\n\nI left the \"reflections\" library in place, per our offline discussion.
