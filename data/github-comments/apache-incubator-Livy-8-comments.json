Eg. we cannot reuse all the auth classes because they depend on the `HiveConf` we may propose to the Hive community to have them accepting in the constructor the parameters they need instead of the `HiveConf`, so we can reuse them.

In many cases, users submit jobs on a daily/hourly basis though an enterprise scheduler. In this case, if a job takes too long to run, it is better to fail it and figure out why it took so long.\r\nAlso, users have the option to keep the jobs alive by reset the last activity time for a

Anyway, it depends on what you consider as \"Inactive\".  In the current behavior, \"Inactive\" refers to the session abstraction in Livy server. So if a user doesn't access it, that object is inactive. If you consider the Spark job, instead, the right behavior is the one described in this PR.\r\n\r\nI agree the current behavior is confusing (I got confused myself at the beginning) and despite the workaround is easy (there is a REST endpoint for avoiding the timeout...), it would be good to clarify and document it better. So, to summarize, I think we should first document properly the current status rather than doing a behavior change as proposed in this PR.\r\ncc @vanzin too for his opinion on this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/457298811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
