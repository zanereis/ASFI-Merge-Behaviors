I have used clustering on COW table, so my knowledge is limited to that.\r\n\r\nClustering can be used in both async and inline. Ideally inline-clustering is preferred if you want to work on the recent changes done by ingestion job. \r\nAsync-clustering is ideal candidate for running clustering on older partitions, like if you want to sort your entire table on a specific column etc or if you want to detach clustering from ingestion job(so that you don't overload ingestion job with clustering rewrites).\r\n\r\nIf clustering is running on an entire partition, these operations are resource intensive and also failure rate may be high. So, it is better to run clustering in async that way the ingestion job is not waiting for inline-clustering to complete.\r\nAnother optimization that is useful while running clustering for backfills, is to run one job for a group of partition instead of running one job for all the partitions. \r\n**Example:** if you need to partition say from partition 2017/01/01 till 2022/02/28, it is better to identify no. of partitions you can run in bulk instead of running them all in one go, this number depends on your available resources and how soon you want to sort all partitions.\r\n\r\nThe grouping of the partitions is achieved by using following configs **PARTITION_FILTER_BEGIN_PARTITION** and **PARTITION_FILTER_END_PARTITION** present in HoodieClusteringConfig class.\r\n\r\nIn addition to grouping you can also schedule multiple clustering jobs in parallel, like say one job for running all partitions in 2017/01 and another job for 2017/02 etc. That way you can fully utilize async nature of clustering to the fullest to complete clustering for the desired partitions.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nAlthough to execute clustering in async with parallelism, you may need to write some extra logic from the service that is starting these clustering jobs, and this should also handle the failure scenarios.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1061218820/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1061225486","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4967#issuecomment-1061225486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4967","id":1061225486,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_QQQO","user":{"login":"parisni","id":9535350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MzUzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9535350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni","html_url":"https://github.com/parisni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parisni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-07T22:57:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T22:57:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot

I am running on r5.4xlarge (meaning 37GB driver memory), so what will be best clusering frequency? What will be the best value for `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.small.file.limit`?\r\n2. Also any other configurations I should be using considering the partition size as mentioned above\r\n3.

`put` or `putall` from TypedProperties) while spark is trying to iterate it to serialize it at the same time. `TypedProperties` could be used by HoodieTable's config(HoodieWriteConfig), so this pr could fix it by avoiding HoodieTable to be serialized.\r\n\r\nBut when I'm trying to solve it with the same way as this pr used, Unfortunately found there could be a lot changes to avoid serializing HoodieTable (Change construction methods of `BulkInsertMapFunction`, `SparkLazyInsertIterable`, `HoodieLazyInsertIterable`, and many kinds of `WriteHandler`), I'm afraid this could be a huge change.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to make `TypedProperties` thread-safe, there are two ways to make `TypedProperties` thread-safe\r\n1. Only change keys to be `Collections.newSetFromMap(new ConcurrentHashMap<>())`, this could avoid `ConcurrentModificationException`, but `TypedProperties` is not really thread-safe, as modify attribute `keys` and save key-value pair is divided into two steps, for example,\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Synchronized is not work actually, because get methods are not synchronized\r\n  public synchronized Object put(Object key, Object value) {\r\n    keys.remove(key);\r\n    keys.add(key);\r\n   // This could cause key is added in keys, but its value is not saved by TypedProperties\r\n    return super.put(key, value);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. Not let `TypedProperties` to extend `Properties`, use an internal `ConcurrentHashMap` to save key and values, this could make `TypedProperties` to be real thread-safe.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TypedProperties implements Serializable {\r\n\r\n  private final ConcurrentHashMap<Object, Object> props = new ConcurrentHashMap<Object, Object>();\r\n\r\n  public TypedProperties() {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public TypedProperties(Properties defaults) {\r\n    if (Objects.nonNull(defaults)) {\r\n      for (String key : defaults.stringPropertyNames()) {\r\n        put(key, defaults.getProperty(key));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public Enumeration<Object> keys() {\r\n    return Collections.enumeration(props.keySet());\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you guys have any other suggestions?
