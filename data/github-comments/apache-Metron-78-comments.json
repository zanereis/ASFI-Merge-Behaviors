The cause of the failure was that mvn install was unable to execute unzipping in Cypress post install script without a mysterious error. Few other guys experienced similar [issues](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3515).\r\nI found no other way to fix failing mvn install step other than removing maven-frontend-plugin and migrating to bash scripts. I intentionally left a branch which contains all changes (tests, simplified test server, npm script normalization, removal of extra dependencies, node/npm version bump etc.) and still failing. Because nvm install step failing all other build job fails too most of the time.\r\nU can check it here: https://travis-ci.org/tiborm/metron/builds/500373545\r\nI found no reason for using maven-frontend-plugin.\r\n- It creates a very uncommon execution environment to our build and our tests (node, npm installed by it an also all the following npm scripts). I doubt that any npm module developer tests their install/build process against having this plugin around it.\r\n- It adds extra complexity to the UI projects compared to node version manager supported by Travis natively (even in a language: java setup).\r\n- I also experienced that it slows down the test execution on my local machine.\r\n\r\nI found cypress reacted on the issue at the time I writeing this.

I see the writer interface change to remove `TopologyContext topologyContext`. It doesn't look like we actually used that context anywhere explicitly, other than maybe the HDFSWriter. Seems like this was a pretty clean change for us in that regard. Is that the case, or can you call out any specific places where this may have caused drama?\r\n2. `metron-storm-common` is a desirable split.

I happened to also see the rogue HBaseConfiguration along with a number of other deps that come from hbase-common getting pulled into the metron-data-management uber jar. Bootstrapping off of your findings, I thought it worthwhile to dig into this a bit more. It seemed like there might be a bug in the Maven shade plugin which would potentially cause us more trouble down the line and I wanted to see what we were in for. For starters, here's the class I'm using as a tracer bullet.\r\n\r\n```\r\njar tvf /Users/mmiklavcic/.m2/repository/org/apache/metron/metron-data-management/0.7.1/metron-data-management-0.7.1.jar|grep HBaseConfiguration\r\n  7195 Mon Mar 18 12:02:08 MDT 2019 org/apache/hadoop/hbase/HBaseConfiguration.class\r\n```\r\n\r\nI went through a similar series of inclusions and exclusions in the mdm pom.xml only to find no change in the rogue deps appearing. Also, regardless of their scope tag, I continued to see that classes in the uber jar. I got to the point where I had excluded all transitive dependencies for hbase-common and *still* was seeing the classes. Either there was a bug in the shade plugin or we were missing something.\r\n\r\nThe next step I took was to look over the dependency:tree from the CLI - all deps checked out accordingly. Default scope included by the Shade plugin? - yep, scope \"provided\" is not included by default. I also examined the build output from the Shade plugin - very clearly, there is no hbase-common dependency included in the shading. This is starting to feel like The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension or The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Either way, it's a trip.\r\n\r\nOk, let's go more brute force on this and explicitly copy dependencies. I looked at the compile scope dependencies first, but that didn't look quite right. I landed on runtime scope most closely representing what the Shade plugin bundles. I then iterated over all the jars looking for the config class.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=/tmp/mikeout -DincludeScope=runtime\r\nfor jar in /tmp/mikeout/*.jar; do echo $jar; jar tvf $jar|grep HBaseConfiguration; done\r\n...\r\n/tmp/mikeout/metron-profiler-client-0.7.1.jar\r\n  7161 Fri Mar 15 15:45:58 MDT 2019 org/apache/hadoop/hbase/HBaseConfiguration.class\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, so there it is. But why??? I looked over our dependency graph and see that metron-data-management depends on metron-enrichment depends on metron-profiler-client. Ok, there's the link, but what about hbase-common? metron-profiler-client has a dependency on hbase-common, scope=compile. Getting closer. The client's pom _also_ has a reference to the maven shade plugin and an assembly.xml. I explored dependencies on metron-profiler-client from a shell script and deployment perspective and did not find any circumstances where we would need to deploy this module stand-alone. I bumped the hbase-common dependency to provided (debatable) and removed all references to shading/relocating and a tarball assembly. I rebuilt the project and no longer see the HBaseConfiguration, or any other hbase-common classes for that matter, in the metron-data-management jar.\r\n\r\nI'm currently undertaking testing from https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/432#issuecomment-276733075 as indicated above, but I think this should solve the root problem without requiring us to modify our license file or eliminate the core Hadoop libs from our shell script classpath.

If I add a rule with a name, the name and score adjustment are shown and the rule is hidden. I think this can be confusing and hard to parse if a user has many rules because of the way we are displaying the data right now.

If I add a rule with a name, the name and score adjustment are shown and the rule is hidden. I think this can be confusing and hard to parse if a user has many rules because of the way we are displaying the data right now. I think it might be better to use a table to display the rule information. If there isn't a name for a rule, that rule's name column remains blank.\r\n\r\nYou're right. I'll add the table headers for each column to make it clear what's going on. I'm also stretching the table. By this, the icons on the right goes to the right side of the pane. It gives more space to display the name for each rule in an individual column.\r\nAs a bonus, I'll replace the \"whatever icon it is\" next to the trash icon with a pencil icon to use the same icons for the same purpose consistently. \r\n\r\n> I also noticed that in the Threat Triage Rules in the read-only pane there is a word break.\r\n\r\nNice catch! 👍 \r\n\r\n> Your testing instructions include a test button, but it looks like that was removed.

Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n2. Open the Alerts UI\r\n3. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55191493-f119ec00-5167-11e9-8444-be77308ccf24.png)\r\n4. Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55191611-3dfdc280-5168-11e9-90ac-dc949f458b7f.png)\r\n5. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n6. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n7. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55191670-67b6e980-5168-11e9-9edd-4d346ed90da8.png)\r\n8.

First, we'll configure the profiler to emit a profile every 1 minute rather than every 15, for expediency:\r\n\r\n    * First, stop the profiler\r\n    * In Ambari, set the profiler period duration to `1` minute via the Profiler config section.\r\n    * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/55196533-4c9ea680-5175-11e9-9b96-74ffdc7f5d81.png)\r\n    * Pull down latest global config to the local file system\r\n        ```$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PULL -o ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER -f```\r\n    * Adjust `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json` to adjust the capture duration:\r\n        ```\r\n        \"profiler.client.period.duration\" : \"1\",\r\n        \"profiler.client.period.duration.units\" : \"MINUTES\"\r\n        ```\r\n    * Push the changes back up to Zookeeper\r\n        ```$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER```\r\n\r\n1.  Start the Stellar Shell with the `-z` command line argument so that a connection to Zookeeper is established.  This is required when  deploying a new profile definition as shown in the steps below.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. If you haven't already, define your profile.\r\n\t```\r\n\t[Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n\t[Stellar]>>> conf\r\n\t{\r\n\t  \"profiles\": [\r\n\t    {\r\n\t      \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n\t      \"onlyif\":  \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n\t      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n\t      \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n\t      \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n\t      \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n\t    }\r\n\t  ]\r\n\t}\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n1. Check what is already deployed.  \r\n\r\n\tPushing a new profile configuration is destructive.  It will overwrite any existing configuration.  Check what you have out there.  Manually merge the existing configuration with your new profile definition.\r\n\r\n\t```\r\n\t[Stellar]>>> existing := CONFIG_GET(\"PROFILER\")\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n1. Deploy your profile.  This will push the configuration to to the live, actively running Profiler topology.  This will overwrite any existing profile definitions.\r\n\r\n\t```\r\n\t[Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n1. Exit the Stellar REPL and now restart the profiler\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the sensor stubs are running.\r\n\r\n    ```service sensor-stubs start```\r\n\r\n1. Wait a few minutes - we want to wait some multiple of the period duration to ensure that the profiler has been able to flush data to HBase multiple times before we check in the next step.\r\n\r\n1. Check the profiler is writing to HBase\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"count 'profiler'\" | hbase shell\r\n    HBase Shell; enter 'help<RETURN>' for list of supported commands.\r\n    Type \"exit<RETURN>\" to leave the HBase Shell\r\n    Version 1.1.2.2.6.5.1050-37, r897822d4dd5956ca186974c10382e9094683fa29, Tue Dec 11 02:04:10 UTC 2018\r\n\r\n    count 'profiler'\r\n    24 row(s) in 0.9550 seconds\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Start the Stellar REPL back up again\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Read values from the profiler. We'll first print out the help on PROFILE_GET and PROFILE_FIXED for context. The ip_src_addr I'm using below, \"192.168.66.1,\" is pulled from one of the records in the alerts UI.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ?PROFILE_GET\r\n    PROFILE_GET\r\n    Description: Retrieves a series of values from a stored profile.\r\n    \r\n    Arguments:\r\n        profile - The name of the profile.\r\n        entity - The name of the entity.\r\n        periods - The list of profile periods to fetch. Use PROFILE_WINDOW or PROFILE_FIXED.\r\n        groups - Optional - The groups to retrieve. Must correspond to the 'groupBy' list used during profile creation. Defaults to an empty list, meaning no groups.\r\n        config_overrides - Optional - Map (in curly braces) of name:value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter of the same name. Default is the empty Map, meaning no overrides.\r\n    \r\n    Returns: The selected profile measurements.\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ?PROFILE_FIXED\r\n    PROFILE_FIXED\r\n    Description: The profiler periods associated with a fixed lookback starting from now.\r\n\r\n    Arguments:\r\n        durationAgo - How long ago should values be retrieved from?\r\n        units - The units of 'durationAgo'.\r\n        config_overrides - Optional - Map (in curly braces) of name:value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter of the same name. Default is the empty Map, meaning no overrides.\r\n\r\n    Returns: The selected profile measurement periods.  These are ProfilePeriod objects.\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.66.1\",PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"MINUTES\"))\r\n    [158, 191, 184, 205, 178, 194, 180]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You should see an array of the profile measurements, as indicated in the command output above.\r\n\r\n## PCAP\r\n\r\nSteps adapted from https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1157#issuecomment-412972370\r\n\r\nGet PCAP data into Metron: \r\n\r\n1. Install and setup pycapa (this has been updated in master recently) - https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-sensors/pycapa/README.md#centos-6\r\n2. (if using singlenode vagrant) You can kill the enrichment, profiler, indexing, and sensor topologies to free up resources, if needed, via `for i in bro enrichment random_access_indexing batch_indexing yaf snort;do storm kill $i;done`\r\n3. Start the pcap topology if it's not already running via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh`\r\n4. Start the pycapa packet capture producer on eth1 via `pycapa --producer --kafka-topic pcap --interface eth1 --kafka-broker $BROKERLIST`\r\n5. Watch the topology in the Storm UI and kill the packet capture utility from before, when the number of packets ingested is over 3k.\r\n6. Ensure that at at least 3 files exist on HDFS by running `hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/pcap/input`\r\n7. Choose a file (denoted by $FILE) and dump a few of the contents using the pcap_inspector utility via `$METRON_HOME/bin/pcap_inspector.sh -i $FILE -n 5`\r\n8. Choose one of the lines and note the protocol.\r\n9. Note that when you run the commands below, the resulting file will be placed in the execution directory where you kicked off the job from.\r\n\r\n### Run a fixed filter query\r\n\r\n1. Switch to the `metron` user (your user needs permissions to the `/apps/metron/interim` and `/apps/metron/output` directories) `su - metron`\r\n1. Run a fixed filter query by executing the following command with the values noted above (match your start_time format to the date format provided - default is to use millis since epoch)\r\n2. `$METRON_HOME/bin/pcap_query.sh fixed -st <start_time> -df \"yyyyMMdd\" -p <protocol_num> -rpf 500`\r\n3. Verify the MR job finishes successfully. Upon completion, you should see multiple files named with relatively current datestamps in your current directory, e.g. pcap-data-20160617160549737+0000.pcap\r\n4. Copy the files to your local machine and verify you can them it in Wireshark. I chose a middle file and the last file. The middle file should have 500 records (per the records_per_file option), and the last one will likely have a number of records <= 500.\r\n\r\n## Flatfile loader\r\n\r\nMake sure no classpath issues have broken it.\r\n\r\nSteps adapted from  https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/432#issuecomment-276733075\r\n\r\n### Preliminaries\r\n\r\n* Download the alexa 1m dataset:\r\n```\r\nwget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\r\nunzip top-1m.csv.zip\r\n```\r\n* Stage import file\r\n```\r\nhead -n 10000 top-1m.csv > top-10k.csv\r\n# plop it on HDFS\r\nhdfs dfs -put top-10k.csv /tmp\r\n```\r\n* Create an extractor.json for the CSV data by editing `extractor.json` and pasting in these contents:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"config\" : {\r\n    \"columns\" : {\r\n       \"domain\" : 1,\r\n       \"rank\" : 0\r\n                }\r\n    ,\"indicator_column\" : \"domain\"\r\n    ,\"type\" : \"alexa\"\r\n    ,\"separator\" : \",\"\r\n             },\r\n  \"extractor\" : \"CSV\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe extractor.json will get used by flatfile_loader.sh in the next step\r\n\r\n### Import from HDFS via MR\r\n\r\n```\r\n# truncate hbase\r\necho \"truncate 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n# import data into hbase \r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i /tmp/top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json -m MR\r\n# count data written and verify it's 10k\r\necho \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Streaming Enrichment\r\n\r\n1. Start by doing some prep and cleaning \r\n\r\n    * Clear out the enrichments table in HBase\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"truncate 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * Stop the sensor stubs\r\n    ```\r\n    service sensor-stubs stop\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * Clear out the ES indexes\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/bro*\"\r\n    curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/yaf*\"\r\n    curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/snort*\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Create a file named `user.json` in the parser directory. `touch ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper/parsers/user.json`\r\n\r\n1. Enter these contents (note that the package for `SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter` has changed)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n     \"parserClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\"\r\n     ,\"writerClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\"\r\n     ,\"sensorTopic\":\"user\"\r\n     ,\"parserConfig\":\r\n     {\r\n        \"shew.table\" : \"enrichment\"\r\n       ,\"shew.cf\" : \"t\"\r\n       ,\"shew.keyColumns\" : \"ip\"\r\n       ,\"shew.enrichmentType\" : \"user\"\r\n       ,\"columns\" : {\r\n          \"user\" : 0\r\n         ,\"ip\" : 1\r\n                    }\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Push the changes back up to Zookeeper\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create the user Kafka topic\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ${HDP_HOME}/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic user\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Start the topology\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ${METRON_HOME}/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -s user -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple file with named `user.csv` with user mapping to IP, e.g.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    mmiklavcic,192.168.138.158\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Push the data to Kafka\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    tail user.csv | ${HDP_HOME}/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic user\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Verify data makes it to the enrichment table.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"scan 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Modify the bro parser to use the new enrichment via Stellar `vim $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/enrichments/bro.json`\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"enrichment\" : {\r\n        \"fieldMap\": {\r\n          \"geo\": [\"ip_dst_addr\", \"ip_src_addr\"],\r\n          \"host\": [\"host\"],\r\n          \"stellar\" : {\r\n            \"config\" : {\r\n              \"user\" : \"ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_src_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"threatIntel\": {\r\n        \"fieldMap\": {\r\n          \"hbaseThreatIntel\": [\"ip_src_addr\", \"ip_dst_addr\"]\r\n        },\r\n        \"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\" : [\"malicious_ip\"],\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\" : [\"malicious_ip\"]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.
