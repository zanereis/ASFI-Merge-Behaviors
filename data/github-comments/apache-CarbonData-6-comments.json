I have one doubt at a time number of records to sort is very less suppose 1 million and in that case we can sort data in memory , but what about scenario like when multiple table is getting loaded at the same time in that case memory consumption will be two high if all the tables are keeping all the data  in memory  and java Arrays sorting is out-of-place sorting so at a time for suppose 1 millions records per table then 10 tables data will be 10 million and as out-of-sorting will make it 20 million so in that case it may go out of memory or it may cause to much gc\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/comments/254030143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/comments/254030521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/carbondata/pull/224#issuecomment-254030521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/carbondata/issues/224","id":254030521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDAzMDUyMQ==","user":{"login":"kumarvishal09","id":13032998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDMyOTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13032998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09","html_url":"https://github.com/kumarvishal09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumarvishal09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-16T06:38:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T06:38:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Zhangshunyu
