For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInvokeHTTP >> PutS3\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the filename used for S3 object key will be the flowfile UUID. This PR will change that to be the filename, which if it is url encoded will still work with PutS3, but if it is decoded will break if the filename contains special characters such as `/`.

I've left few comments in the code, though I have a general question too.\r\n> \r\n> I tried to search what kind of headers could fit into the headers property. Is there a common list of them or something like that. Unfortunately I didn't find any. The closest information was that developers often misuse that property, because by design you should store information about the message itself in that field. So a negative example is that if you would like to publish information about a http request, the http header should be in the message, but developers often put that info into the headers property. With that in mind I wondering what could be a real value set of that field and how likely you would have commas in the values. Isn't it an edge case that normally would be better to discourage?\r\n\r\n\r\nHi @nandorsoma,\r\nThank you for your quick response. \r\nFor our scenario, the comma is in the object id. So this is information about the message itself for us.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/971618703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/971698646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5529#issuecomment-971698646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5529","id":971698646,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM456vHW","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T15:37:06Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T15:37:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/971698646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/971723064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5514#issuecomment-971723064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5514","id":971723064,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM4561E4","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T16:03:28Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T16:03:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @markap14 In reviewing the changes to fingerprinting, it appears the `FingerprintFactory` class is no longer used in `PopularVoteFlowElection`.

This commit also reflects that there are rebase issues that will need to be resolved.\r\n\r\nAlso for such a processor you will want to ensure the naming scheme is followed. Instead of RateLimiter the processor name would be 'LimitRate' and 'LimitRecordRate'.\r\n\r\nFor each of the dependencies and their transitive dependencies are the licenses compatible with ASF projects?  We will need to ensure proper licensing and notice information is provided.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/974110520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/974111578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5539#issuecomment-974111578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5539","id":974111578,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM46D8Na","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-19T14:18:37Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T14:18:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You also want to make sure the git commit message indicates the correct JIRA entry.  for this it should include 'NIFI-8703' instead of other variations/cases/etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/974111578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/974147136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5539#issuecomment-974147136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5539","id":974147136,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM46EE5A","user":{"login":"Kerudal","id":43355581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU1NTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43355581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal","html_url":"https://github.com/Kerudal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kerudal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-19T15:03:10Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T15:03:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello Joe, \r\n\r\nThank you for the clarification.

Changing HashMap to LinkedHashMap eliminate such random behavior. It ensures that `initCompositeUserGroupProvider` has deterministic order while using `mockProperties`.
