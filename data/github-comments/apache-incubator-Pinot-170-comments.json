An example usage might be a Spark pipeline generating intermediate data sketches before writing into Pinot. Pinot can serve queries with complex filters and eventually merge/intersect these sketches to produce estimates.\r\n\r\nThis can already be achieved in Pinot for cardinality estimation using ThetaSketch functions 👍 .\r\nI think a quantile implementation such as KLL and a Frequent Items sketch from this library would be great additions to complete the picture.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to give it a go if we can get a consensus on including them. @mayankshriv please let me know what you think. \r\n\r\ncc @chenboat ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1416502419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1416598446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10228#issuecomment-1416598446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10228","id":1416598446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Ub5Ou","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-04T01:52:21Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T00:17:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10228?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#10228](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/10228?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (6564aaa) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/0bbb9455eb7aa374e0c8b1e2c5ec0a4d6cd7a93e?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (0bbb945) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `56.33%`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master   #10228      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     70.43%   70.42%   -0.01%     \n+ Complexity     5759     5100     -659     \n============================================\n  Files          2016     2017       +1     \n  Lines        109154   109153       -1     \n  Branches      16583    16594      +11     \n============================================\n- Hits          76881    76874       -7     \n+ Misses        26894    26892       -2     \n- Partials       5379     5387       +8     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `24.73% <0.00%> (+0.13%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| integration2 | `24.36% <0.00%> (-0.18%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests1 | `67.66% <56.33%> (-0.07%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| unittests2 | `13.71% <0.00%> (+0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

I'd suggest not introducing the lead controller concept into this module, but simply handle the case of file deleted during the checks because lead controller change is not guaranteed to be visible to all controllers at the same time.\r\n\r\nYes, we ran into some exception that multiple controllers were trying to delete for the same table in production. \r\nThere is a 5-min delay config in lead controller resource, which means there would be lead controller changes only when there is some discrepancy between IS and EV for 5 mins.\r\nI think in this case it should be fine despite the lead controller change hasn't reached the controllers, as we just need a dedicated controller to clean up the aged segments. Even if one controller is permanently removed out of the cluster, it's okay to have the aged segments stay for another 5 mins and then another new controller got assigned to take the segment deletion. \r\n\r\nI'm fine with capturing the exception within a try-catch block and proceed with the aged segment deletion for the rest of the tables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1421586088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1421587554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10243#issuecomment-1421587554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10243","id":1421587554,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5Uu7Ri","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-07T23:01:23Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T23:01:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you add some context on why these tmp files are created?
