This would prevent the workers from becoming zombie processes if they overrode the SIGHUP handlers or became deadlocked in C code and were unable to respond to signals.\n\nAny edge-cases in the SIGHUP handling here should also be present in the original version, so I'm inclined to merge this patch now and revisit the SIGKILL suggestion in a later patch.  Also, we may want to take additional time to consider whether we want to support cleaner termination of workers (e.g. first attempt to shut them down gracefully so `atexit` handlers or `finally` blocks have a chance to run, and eventually send a SIGKILL to guarantee termination).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50949931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50949959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1624#issuecomment-50949959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1624","id":50949959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTQ5OTU5","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T01:18:32Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T01:18:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins,

To me, doesn't make semantic sense to expose `spark.scheduler.minRegisteredExecutorsRatio` in standalone mode because applications in standalone mode to not request a fixed number of executors a-priori. So my proposal is to remove this feature in standalone mode alltogether. The semantics of `spark.cores.max` is just the maximum number. In some cases users run jobs with this set well above the number of available cores (because they decided to run on a smaller cluster) and it is fully supported. If we enforce a minimum, it will cause all jobs to hang for those users.\n\nIf users in standalone mode want to wait, for now they should add their own code to sleep until the number of desired executors appears. They can do this by calling `sc.getExecutorStorageStatus.size()` or we can also add an API called `sc.getNumExecutors` that does this.\n\nAlso curious what @mateiz and @aarondav think about this. I haven't been following this patch previously.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50950169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50950223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1525#issuecomment-50950223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1525","id":50950223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTUwMjIz","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-02T01:27:33Z","updated_at":"2014-08-02T01:27:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
