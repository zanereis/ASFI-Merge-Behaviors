James helps to find a clean way to update ClientFixture to replace the old method in BaseTestQuery which isn't compatible well with ClusterTest, and a new way to handle UserException. I can help to update those information in a new PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1430637603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1430704625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2756#issuecomment-1430704625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2756","id":1430704625,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5VRtHx","user":{"login":"jnturton","id":9107319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMDczMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9107319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton","html_url":"https://github.com/jnturton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnturton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-15T03:38:22Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T03:38:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, I think the penny's finally dropped.

This code get the column's min and max values from the parquet file's meta data and compares the millisecond argument from the WHERE clause to the microsecond min/max values without converting them. This causes all files to be filtered out at this stage.\r\n\r\nI did a quick test of this theory and added the following to\r\n`org.apache.drill.exec.store.parquet.metadata.FileMetadataCollector` at line 211:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (columnTypeMetadata.originalType == OriginalType.TIMESTAMP_MICROS) {\r\n          minValue = Long.valueOf(((Number) minValue).longValue() / 1000);\r\n          maxValue = Long.valueOf(((Number) maxValue).longValue() / 1000);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nin context, the new code looks like this from line 203:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      if (!stats.isEmpty() && stats.hasNonNullValue()) {\r\n        minValue = stats.genericGetMin();\r\n        maxValue = stats.genericGetMax();\r\n        if (containsCorruptDates == ParquetReaderUtility.DateCorruptionStatus.META_SHOWS_CORRUPTION\r\n          && columnTypeMetadata.originalType == OriginalType.DATE) {\r\n          minValue = ParquetReaderUtility.autoCorrectCorruptedDate((Integer) minValue);\r\n          maxValue = ParquetReaderUtility.autoCorrectCorruptedDate((Integer) maxValue);\r\n        }\r\n        if (columnTypeMetadata.originalType == OriginalType.TIMESTAMP_MICROS) {\r\n          minValue = Long.valueOf(((Number) minValue).longValue() / 1000);\r\n          maxValue = Long.valueOf(((Number) maxValue).longValue() / 1000);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      long numNulls = stats.getNumNulls();\r\n      Metadata_V4.ColumnMetadata_v4 columnMetadata = new Metadata_V4.ColumnMetadata_v4(columnTypeMetadata.name,\r\n          primitiveTypeName, minValue, maxValue, numNulls);\r\n      columnMetadataList.add(columnMetadata);\r\n      columnTypeMetadata.isInteresting = true;\r\n```\r\nFrom my limited testing this could potentially fix the problem.

Drill does only support millisecond precision in its TIMESTAMP type and it does handle timestamps that have greater precision by flooring to the nearest millisecond (or by sending them to a BIGINT instead).

After doing some tests I think there may be a bug affecting the direct memory counter in the most recent version of Drill.\r\n2. If you hover over the direct memory usage info icon you'll see that, unlike for the heap, Drill reports current usage as a percentage of _peak_ usage, not of the configured capacity.\r\n3. Your query is probably getting executed entirely, or almost, on the RDBMS. Drill tries to \"push down\" query execution to the source system when it can. You can prevent this by running two queries, first a CTAS that fetches data from DEF_TABLE without performing any operations and writes it somewhere, perhaps the temp workspace. Secondly, do all of the rest of the logic in a SELECT based on the table that was created by the CTAS. Note however that this will require 180m rows to be transferred from the RDBMS to Drill over JDBC which will itself need a lot of time (but may not always need to be repeated).\r\n\r\nI'll report back here about the direct memory counter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1500895198/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1504077529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/issues/2402#issuecomment-1504077529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2402","id":1504077529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5ZpmbZ","user":{"login":"philou93","id":25047855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDQ3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25047855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93","html_url":"https://github.com/philou93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philou93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-11T20:54:57Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T20:54:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nIs there any news on this issue?
