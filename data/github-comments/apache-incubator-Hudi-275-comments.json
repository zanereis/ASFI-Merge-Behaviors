This has also been tested and there is no compatibility issue.  Both COW and MOR tables with Deltastreamer are tested.  The changes are both backward and forward compatible, i.e., (1) Spark and utilities bundles after this PR can load time and commit metadata with redundant fields generated before this PR, (2) Spark and utilities bundles before this PR can load time and commit metadata without redundant fields generated after this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1244675503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1244681739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5074#issuecomment-1244681739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5074","id":1244681739,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5KMFYL","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T23:00:56Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T23:00:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"might be good to revisit after https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5815 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1244681739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1244684974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3605#issuecomment-1244684974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3605","id":1244684974,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5KMGKu","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T23:03:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T23:03:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"we have done lot of improvements around perf w/ hudi. https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2022/06/29/Apache-Hudi-vs-Delta-Lake-transparent-tpc-ds-lakehouse-performance-benchmarks\r\n\r\nCan you try out 0.12. \r\nClosing it out due to long inactivity.
