Full disclosure I personally prefer okhttp and enjoy coding with it... this module has been easy to support for years and often times authors of change switch direction. Wanting to maintain something is important.\r\n\r\nHaving something others are happy to maintain is an important part of the decision. For example, @anuraaga wrote the original one, but he uses stackdriver now. IIRC @jcarres-mdsol uses this in AWS, eventhough the first AWS user was @devinsba. People change roles and integrations like this fade out of focus. It may fade out of focus for you in a year who knows.. that's why we need buy in.\r\n\r\nLet's say tests pass without dropping versions, aws still works etc.. To answer your question directly about mergability.  I'd like to see another maintainer who isn't currently required to use elasticsearch ok with helping maintain this. We should also revise our support policy in that case to follow elasticsearch's which will affect end sites. For example, if they haven't already dropped a version we support, you can guarantee they will. We need to be transparent with users that our support range will be in elasticsearch's hands if this is merged. If other committers are on-board even if you or I step away, I'm fine on it.\r\n\r\nI would prefer that similar effort was made to address whatever the problem is in okhttp though as that would break less people. However, yeah I mean what I said, if other folks can get behind this, I'd also be ok.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/475075241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/475104106","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2458#issuecomment-475104106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2458","id":475104106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTEwNDEwNg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T03:36:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T03:36:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"this is a good question. can you please ask on gitter or stackoverflow?

Can you explain?\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Use_of_hard-coded_password and a bunch\nof other posts. The background issue (the one I linked, not what you\ncreated) also mentions that people have different ideas when it comes\nto auth. For example api keys, mutual TLS, oauth, etc. That and many\nare not using http for span data either (ex disable it), and the\noptions for messaging security are a bit random. I don't want to\nwander this issue, all I meant to say is that there are some problems\nincluding the vulnerability aspects and depending on impl whether the\nserver reboots to see a new password and how exactly such a password\nchange would roll out to your instrumented apps. I remember this a\ndecade ago was a bit of an issue. Making a default for basic auth\nwould imply for us at least thinking that through which I think some\nwould reasonably say \"please don't do basic auth\". This is why I'm\nmore interested in seeing how to allow you to opt in. I would prefer\ndebates about whether basic is smart or not to remain on the other\nissue.

Higher throughput sites often run multiple collectors though. I would say that most users will not be doing more than a thousand of messages/second.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this may change as more people explore the costs involved in unsampled (usually this means late sampled, or tiered) collection. For example, we have a https://github.com/adriancole/zipkin-voltdb experiment which can swallow a lot more data than most storage backends. If someone doing 1k messages per second at 1% decides to do 100%, that means multiplying the throughput. For example, some doing what we call \"firehose mode\" like yelp, they had to write custom collectors as they went over what their kafka setup could do. This is more a thought for you vs what's commonly the case now. I mean to hint there could be some sites doing 100k messages/second into a short term buffer, even if I have no idea when that would be practiced and what the sharding of that rate would typically look like.\r\n\r\nBack to reality :)\r\n\r\nYou'll notice some mentioning the order of thousands of spans per second here. No one currently is using activemq, but that's what this issue is about :) spans should be bundled (ex many spans per message), so if you have say.. 8k spans/second, ideally this is bundled into <1k messages/second of size in orders of low kilobytes.\r\n\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZIPKIN/Sites\r\n\r\nI'll ask some of the sites to provide more fine grained details on bundling mechanics.

It seems that spring-security is largely servlet based. Currently our web controllers are armeria which directly implement over netty I think... this is both read and write endpoints.\r\n\r\n* Getting auth is one thing (basically wiring in an `ArmeriaServerConfigurator` which decorates it).\r\n* Getting spring-security is another (probably doing some sort of adapter model)\r\n\r\nTo solve things at the correct layer of abstraction, if spring-security implementation is important to you, I think it should be an issue request here https://github.com/line/armeria\r\n\r\nRegardless, in general we suggest using a proxy or gateway and/or turning off endpoints not needed. We made [this example](https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-ui#zipkin-ui) for exactly the reason of security templating. Another example, Tyro are a bank and they simply disable query where it should not be used and visa versa for the collector endpoint. I'm repeating stuff already discussed in #782 for context only. We can track this issue independently for what is viable for basic auth as a \"at your own risk\" add-on to the server.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/476955904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/476956780","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2467#issuecomment-476956780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2467","id":476956780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njk1Njc4MA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T03:32:28Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T03:32:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Note: I found a couple classes that might be relevant for armeria+spring security.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, this is wrapping the servlet-based code so that it can be re-used in spring webflux\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/b93528138e2b2f7ad34d10a040e6b7ac50fc587a/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/server/WebFilterChainProxy.java\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/b93528138e2b2f7ad34d10a040e6b7ac50fc587a/config/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/web/reactive/WebFluxSecurityConfiguration.java#L60","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/476956780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/477015700","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2466#issuecomment-477015700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2466","id":477015700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzAxNTcwMA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-27T07:33:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T07:33:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@moekelley76 by \"I'm ready\" does this mean you can try this code?

One of the downsides is it's really difficult to aggregate across multiple instances of the same service. \r\n\r\nThis is true if you compute percentiles in the application before shipping them. Clearly percentile data itself is non-aggregable across dimensions. \r\n\r\nThis is what percentile approximations off of discretized histogram data is designed to solve. See things like [histogram_quantile](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#histogram_quantile). The individual histograms for several dimensions (say a host dimension) can be aggregated by pairwise summing the buckets and then performing the calculation off of the summed histogram.\r\n\r\nEven percentiles may not be as useful as you folks think, depending on the application. If what you are really after as a business is saying \"I want no more than 1% of my users to experience a greater than 10ms latency\", once way of viewing this is that the 99th percentile needs to be less than 10ms. Another way of looking at this is to simply count how many requests are less than 10ms, and then  `(total_throughput - count_less_than_10ms) / total_throughput <= 0.01`. This latter approach is far cheaper than even computing percentile approximations over discretized histogram data.\r\n\r\nBottom line: percentile data needs to be computed off of either 100% sampled tracing data (haystack) or metrics telemetry (aggregated). Trying to reason about a distribution from downsampled data is a fool's errand.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/477448527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
