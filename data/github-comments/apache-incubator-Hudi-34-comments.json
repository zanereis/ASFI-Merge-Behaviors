My thinking was that a user would use this Index only to scan extra partitions for global update/delete but could then use the normal HoodieBloomIndex by default for the improved performance. But that is more of a view than an index then.\r\n\r\nAs it stands the current implementation of HoodieGlobalBloomIndex doesn't really guarantee globally unique keys either if an insert contains duplicates. This causes weird behaviors when records with duplicates are updated which is the reason why we created this Index.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/559222366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/559224596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1021#issuecomment-559224596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1021","id":559224596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTIyNDU5Ng==","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T19:35:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T19:35:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vinothchandar : I found the root cause.  \r\n\r\nwithin HoodieGlobalIndex#explodeRecordRDDWithFileComparisons\r\n\r\n```\r\nJavaRDD<Tuple2<String, HoodieKey>> explodeRecordRDDWithFileComparisons(\r\n      final Map<String, List<BloomIndexFileInfo>> partitionToFileIndexInfo,\r\n      JavaPairRDD<String, String> partitionRecordKeyPairRDD) {\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n return  partitionRecordKeyPairRDD.map(partitionRecordKeyPair -> {\r\n         String recordKey = partitionRecordKeyPair._2();\r\n         String partitionPath = partitionRecordKeyPair._1();\r\n\r\n         return indexFileFilter.getMatchingFiles(partitionPath, recordKey).stream()\r\n          .map(file -> new Tuple2<>(file, new HoodieKey(recordKey, indexToPartitionMap.get(file))))\r\n          .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n    }).flatMap(List::iterator);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this, indexFileFilter.getMatchingFiles(partitionPath, recordKey) returns fileId from Partition1, where as incoming record is tagged with Partition2. \r\n\r\nSo, this is what I am thinking as the fix. as of now, IndexFileFilter.getMatchingFiles(String partitionPath, String recordKey) is returning Set<fileId>s.

Incrementing columns can be of below types \r\n1. Timestamp columns\r\n2. Auto Incrementing column\r\n3. Timestamp + Auto Incrementing.\r\nInstead of code figuring out the incremental pull strategy, it'll be better if user provides it as config for each table.\r\nConsidering Timestamp incrementing column, there can be more than once column contributing to this strategy. e.g. When a row is creation, only `created_at` column is set and `updated_at` is null by default. When the same row is updated, `updated_at` gets assigned to some timestamp. In such cases it is wise to consider both columns in the query formation. \r\n\r\n- [ ] We need to sort rows according to above mentioned incrementing columns to fetch rows in chunks (you can make use of `defaultFetchSize` in MySQL). I'm aware that sorting adds load on Database, but it helps in tracking the last pulled timestamp or auto incrementing id and help retry/resume from the point last recorded. This will be a saviour during failures.\r\n\r\nA sample MySQL query for incrementing timestamp columns as (`created_at` and `updated_at`)  might look like \r\n`SELECT * FROM inventory.customers WHERE COALESCE(inventory.customers.updated_at, inventory.customers.created_at) > $last_recorder_time AND COALESCE(inventory.customers.updated_at,inventory.customers.created_at) < $current_time ORDER BY COALESCE(inventory.customers.updated_at,inventory.customers.created_at) ASC`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/559230742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/559253002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/750#issuecomment-559253002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/750","id":559253002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTI1MzAwMg==","user":{"login":"tooptoop4","id":33283496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjgzNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33283496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4","html_url":"https://github.com/tooptoop4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T21:14:45Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T21:14:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@RonBarabash  does this fix issue with 0 byte .commit file? also how are u running hudi with spark 2.4? did u change spark version reference in hudi pom.xm!?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/559253002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/559299927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1054#issuecomment-559299927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1054","id":559299927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTI5OTkyNw==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-28T00:56:39Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T00:56:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Thanks for doing this!
