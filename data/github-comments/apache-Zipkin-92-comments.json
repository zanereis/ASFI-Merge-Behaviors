the docker topic, as I understand it, the problem is advertising a third party image. Clearly, there is no requirement to even have a docker image. For example, Kafka produces none, though the commercial company behind it does.\r\n\r\nI can grok not wanting to be a sneaky ad for a commercial package, but I don't know where exactly a problem would be in mentioning images that predated apache and are completely non-commercial in nature. It seems odd that Apache would actually have a problem with a healthy ecosystem that produces tools for it to the point where it intentionally wants you to make it hard to find them. However, we seem to be in a culture which is against things and I am tired of arguing against the grain for sensible pragmatism.\r\n\r\nI think the work and confusion involved in splitting our docker images between the openzipkin namespace and apache namespace is more of a burden than instructing people manually how to find docker images. What that seems to mean is deleting references to the openzipkin images until the leadership in ASF decide that OSS ecosystems are nothing to be afraid of.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/493731738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/493733917","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2596#issuecomment-493733917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2596","id":493733917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzczMzkxNw==","user":{"login":"anuraaga","id":198344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga","html_url":"https://github.com/anuraaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuraaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-19T07:29:06Z","updated_at":"2019-05-19T07:29:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's easy to check, armeria logs at startup whether it's using openssl or not.

I guess the lazy thing is to use `--direct` to behave the same way as Rat. OTOH as long as all our transitive dependencies are A-OK, we can afford to be more strict.\r\n\r\nI've worked through licenses of our dependencies and compared to https://apache.org/legal/resolved.html. Things that stand out:\r\n\r\n* `CC-BY-3.0` and `CC-BY-4.0`: ASF says \"Works under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licenses (2.5, 3.0, and 4.0) contain terms related to \"Effective Technological Measures\", which may come as a surprise to users. Thus their inclusion shall be appropriately labelled and only in binary form.\"\r\n  * Packages: `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free`, `spdx-exceptions`, `caniuse-lite`\r\n  * My take: I'm not clear on what \"appropriately labelled\" means. For fontawesome, we're good on \"only in binary form\". The other two packages contain stuff that doesn't _have_ a binary form (JSON data and HTML/... components), so I guess we're alright?\r\n* `MPL-2.0`: ASF says \"Each license in this section requires some degree of reciprocity. This may mean that additional action is warranted in order to minimize the chance that a user of an Apache product will create a derivative work of a differently-licensed portion of an Apache product without being aware of the applicable requirements.\"\r\n  * Packages: `mdn-data` (https://github.com/mdn/data)\r\n  * My take: the ASF 3rd-party license policy is vague enough to be useless for me here. No idea whether we're in the clear.\r\n\r\nFun one I didn't know about; \"Unlicense\" is an actual license name , and it explicitly assigns software to the public domain.
