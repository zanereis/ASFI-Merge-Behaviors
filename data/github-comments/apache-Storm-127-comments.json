We have not had any issues in the past with large commits, like when we contributed the security code to storm which followed essentially the same process as this code. On my end it is probably going to take longer than the 72 hour waiting period to track down the right people to get signatures and they will all ask me why we have to do this when my team has blanket approval to contribute to storm.\n> \n> Like I said if you insist on getting IP clearance we will do it, but all it is just going to do is add more pain for me which I really would like to avoid if I can.\n\nMy apologies for seeming to come out of the blue on this, it’s not my intention to put up roadblocks or delay anything. Rather, I’m trying to make sure _**we, the PMC**_ do a better job of complying with ASF policy. It’s become clear to me that there were a number of cases in the past where we did not properly adhere to the IP Clearance policy. A lot of that stems from a lack of knowledge on my part and others’ as to when IP Clearance is required. I’m trying to correct that going forward.\n\nAdmittedly, the paragraph regarding IP Clearance is vague. Here are a few points about the pull request that triggered the “IP Clearance flag” in my head (please correct me if I’m wrong about anything):\n- Was the code developed in the open, using ASF infrastructure? (No, it was developed internally at Yahoo, even though the intent was to eventually contribute it to the community).\n- Was the Apache community aware of its existence from inception, or early on, such that it could contribute to it’s development? (No, see previous point. Also, the initial JIRA stated that it was under development internally at Yahoo.)\n- Is the commit history intact such that all contributors can be identified? (No, all commits are by one individual, and the initial commit appears to be an import of an existing codebase that might have involved other contributors.)\n\nPlease don’t take any of the above as criticisms, I’m just pointing out what triggered IP clearance consideration in my head. \n\nIf all the contributors involved are covered either by a CCLA or an ICLA, I think all we would need is a software grant. I can do the rest of the work, and the code review can certainly continue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/153497694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/153511753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/825#issuecomment-153511753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/825","id":153511753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzUxMTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T22:39:31Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T22:39:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tests passed for java 8.

Even though the core of this was developed in a separate repository anything and everything in this pull request is up for modification if the community feels that we need to.  The design document has been up for over a week, and the JIRA itself has been open since June that no one touched until now, but could have.  And most of the code has been touched in preparing it to work with Nimbus HA, specifically for this.  Lastly I don't see a reason to have the code contribution be attributed line by line, if we call out exactly who helped contribute to the patch.\n\nIf you feel that we need an IP Grant for this I will make it happen, but going forward we the PMC need to have a discussion and clarify these questions, because to me leaving this up to a gut feeling is just going to put up too many barriers and potential frustration for developers.

This will allow users to understand better the performance of many of Storm's internal as well as potentially identifying performance problems and bottlenecks.</p>\n\n<p>    Also wrote a piece of documentation to what is being done:</p>\n\n<p>    docs/documentation/storm-metrics-profiling-internal-actions.md</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/jerrypeng/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/jerrypeng/storm</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1158\" title=\"Storm metrics to profile various storm functions\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1158\"><del>STORM-1158</del></a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/850.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/850.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #850</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit d0d12f110476fd2443f8f163c1cfd892f58a7856<br/>\nAuthor: Boyang Jerry Peng <jerrypeng@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-03T20:36:55Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1158\" title=\"Storm metrics to profile various storm functions\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1158\"><del>STORM-1158</del></a> - Storm metrics to profile various storm functions</p>\n\n<p>commit 7ff61ce4e540c5e026ccdfe3bc84fe5266b158da<br/>\nAuthor: Boyang Jerry Peng <jerrypeng@yahoo-inc.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-03T22:36:29Z</p>\n\n<p>    adding documentation for storm metrics</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612623766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612569460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4724#issuecomment-2612569460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4724","id":2612569460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1Njk0NjA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T23:06:45Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:46:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user kishorvpatil commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/838#discussion_r43820769\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/838#discussion_r43820769</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212;

checks of supervisor, which is important to avoid unnecessary try of starting new workers in a problem node. <br/>\nBut for the running workers, it might not be a good choice to kill them when the health check of supervisor is failed. It is very difficult to use external script to check if the running workers are still in a correct status.

I think it is reasonable to kill those worker if we find the health check scripts on a node fail.</p>\n\n<p>a. There do exist the scenario where a supervisor cannot heartbeat while its workers are still working well and heartbeating. In such case, the nimbus will treat the supervisor as isolated nodes and still treats the workers as healthy. And health check feature will not break this case.</p>\n\n<p>b. However, if health check scripts fail, it normally indicates that it is no longer appropriate to run any worker on this node, so it is quite necessary for us to kill the running workers on this node. Health check scripts do checking such as the disk available space, network connection, security keys, etc. If we just exit the supervisor while still let the workers running, such workers may cause unexpected error. Our initiative for health check is to ban those nodes who has problems.  </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612623127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612623134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4993#issuecomment-2612623134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4993","id":2612623134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MjMxMzQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T02:50:16Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:10:36Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=longdafeng\">longdafeng</a>:</i>\n<p>@all</p>\n\n<p>I think this is very useful to improve stability of Storm.</p>\n\n<p>In the last four years, I have met so many errors, any one of these error will lead to the whole cluster slow down.

health check is failed. But not all scenarios can demonstrate running workers are in an abnormal status, e.g. lack enough system memory for a new worker. Even though for some unexpected condition like no availabe disk space or network connection, worker will kill itself or will be re-assigned by nimbus (network connection failure will canse heartbeat timeout). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=zhuoliu\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"zhuoliu\">Zhuo Liu</a> <a

operation when health check of supervisor is failed, e.g. user can config which health checks scripts will cause the shutdown of supervisor, and which checks will kill all running workers?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612623141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612442973","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4004#issuecomment-2612442973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4004","id":2612442973,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NDI5NzM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T04:57:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:42:20Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1167\" title=\"Add sliding & tumbling window support for core storm\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1167\"><del>STORM-1167</del></a>: Add windowing support for storm core</p>\n\n<p>    Currently, topologies that needs windowing support requires writing custom logic inside bolts making it tedious to handle the windowing and acking logic with custom logic.</p>\n\n<p>    The PR proposes to add framework level support to core storm bolts to process tuples in a time or a count based window. Sliding and tumbling windows based on tuple count or time duration are supported.</p>\n\n<p>    A new bolt interface is added for bolts that needs windowing support.</p>\n\n<p>    ```<br/>\n    public interface IWindowedBolt extends IComponent </p>\n{\nvoid prepare(Map stormConf, TopologyContext context, OutputCollector collector);\n/**\n * Process tuples falling within the window and optionally emit \n * new tuples based on the tuples in the input window.\n */\nvoid execute(TupleWindow inputWindow);\nvoid cleanup();\n    }\n<p>    ```</p>\n\n<p>    `TupleWindow` gives access to the current tuples in the window, the tuples that expired and the new tuples that are added since last window was computed which will be useful for efficient windowing computations.</p>\n\n<p>    The `TopologyBuilder` wraps the IWindowedBolt implementation in an internal bolt `WindowedBoltExecutor` (similar to `BasicBoltExecutor`), which receives the tuples and hands it off to IWindowedBolt when the window conditions are met. The tuples are automatically acked when they fall out of the window and the tuples in a window are automatically anchored with the tuple emitted from an IWindowedBolt to provide atleast once guarentee. An example topology `SlidingWindowTopology` shows how to use the apis to compute a sliding window sum.</p>\n\n<p>    The tuples are tracked with the system timestamp when they are received by the bolt. Later we can add support for tuple based timestamps (e.g the ts when the tuple was generated). There is also scope for minimizing duplicates by tracking the evaluated tuples (based on some id) in a persistent store.</p>\n\n<p>    Similiar windowing constructs needs to be added to storm trident apis as well. That can be addressed once the basic support to store core is added and the common logic can be reused.</p>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/arunmahadevan/storm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/arunmahadevan/storm</a> windowing</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/855.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/855.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #855</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 77429d07d7c080962b8c414cf02ee93839b25ca2<br/>\nAuthor: Arun Mahadevan <aiyer@hortonworks.com><br/>\nDate:   2015-11-04T11:29:19Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1167\" title=\"Add sliding & tumbling window support for core storm\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1167\"><del>STORM-1167</del></a>: Add windowing support for storm core</p>\n\n<p>    1.

Do you have a concern with the proposed solution?<br/>\nThe proposed interface and patch allow the user to write any number of scripts and place them in the health check dir to get run.   I believe you can do all the things you mention with these scripts unless those things put the system in such a bad state they can't do anything.  yes you have to write them yourself but I think that makes sense based on the number of different setups people would use. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=basti.lj\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"basti.lj\">Basti Liu</a>  thanks for the inquiry. I understand your concern.  the interface chosen here is the same as what Hadoop supports.  We chose this so scripts could be used across both hadoop clusters and storm clusters.  If the scripts determine the node is unhealthy and shut down the supervisor then there is no way to control or monitor the workers running on it so it seems to make sense that we kill the workers also.  If you don't want to shut down of the supervisor on certain conditions then it shouldn't be in the health check scripts.  These checks are specifically for external things or node health scripts and the idea would be the node is in bad state so nothing should run on it.  I think there are another category of issues like you mention that would fall more into a black listing feature - <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-909\" title=\"Automatic Black Listing of bad nodes\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-909\"><del>STORM-909</del></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have specific scenarios in mind?  I think the memory one you mention should be resolved with the resource aware scheduler.  </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612623147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612622188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4986#issuecomment-2612622188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4986","id":2612622188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MjIxODg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T14:31:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:10:10Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=rkellogg\">rkellogg</a>:</i>\n<p>Agreed.

Hopefully resource aware scheduling that we have been working on along with the cgroup support from JStorm will help take care of some issues with bad topologies, but there will always be hardware that dies or is in the process of dieing that will slow everything down.  Storm is especially sensitive to these slow nodes, as it does not have speculative execution, yet.
