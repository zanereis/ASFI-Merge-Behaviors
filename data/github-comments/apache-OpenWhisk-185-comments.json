For instance, if you only have a single controller in your deployment, its credentials should be under `controller/controller0`. if you delete the whole directory it will be regenerated each time you run `setup.yml`.\r\n\r\nOn further note, since you are reproducing rainbowCake, make sure openwhisk can access your CouchDB instance. It could be because you already have a local CouchDB on your machine and also another instance deployed on your docker engine. In that case, I would recommend removing your manually deployed CouchDB and let the yml scripts install CouchDB using docker images.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/2212992947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/2214997378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5331#issuecomment-2214997378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5331","id":2214997378,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc6EBi2C","user":{"login":"Suraez","id":45430290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMwMjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45430290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez","html_url":"https://github.com/Suraez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Suraez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-08T19:21:17Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T19:21:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I did the followings:\r\n\r\n1.

No prewarmed containers (like in ow terminology) but I force 60 cold starts to create 60 containers (for the same action) and once they are up and running, I invoke a workload (the same action) with a fixed arrival rate of 100 rps. A request takes around ~ 0.02 seconds. So in principle, there should be 2 containers busy at all times which is also the case. However, between this workload, there are periodic bursts of 40-60+ jobs getting queued at the KafkaProducerConnector producer.send() future call which all of them then go to the invoker and then if around 60+ jobs were queued get scheduled, it then induces a cold start. I am not sure why there would be a backpressure from the invoker when there are no no cold starts happening? And how would a backpressure from the invoker introduce pressure on kafka from not being to send the acknowledgment to the controller that it has produced the message?

Are you able to invoke an action?**\r\nI haven't deployed this till now. I've been working with OpenWhisk 1.0.0 which is the one that comes with  https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube repository. I've raised an issue there to understand how to get OpenWhisk 2.0.0 up and running with k8s where you gave some pointers https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/issues/781#issuecomment-2316569110 . I'll be working on getting this up in the meantime. \r\n\r\nSo this question is something that is part of my doubts. As in, if I want to deploy OpenWhisk 2.0.0 in a multi node setting in a scalable manner, how should I go about it? Is ansible a way for that, or is there some way to user kubernetes for this?\r\n\r\n---\r\n**What is your concurrency limit and userMemory assigned to invokers?**\r\nMy action concurrency limits are 1 and there are 3 invokers each with ~20000m of memory. After checking in grafana dashboard this seems to be fine since each invoker showed 40 pods of 512mb memory each at peak.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSome more updates from the benchmarking I did in the meantime:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of benchmarking the scale of workflows, I went back to load testing 1 action at a time. I had a graph processing workflow in which let's say there were 2 actions A and B.\r\n2. Benchmarking A with multiple RPS made it scale well. I tried with 1/4/8/16 RPS for 5 minutes each and it reused warm containers and got stable soon.\r\n3.  But when I ran benchmarking for another action B after A, the warm containers were not used. Even though both A and B use same runtimes, same amount of memory and same requirements for pip.\r\n\r\nSo I think the warm containers not being used amongst different actions is what's causing my workflows to not scale. I saw invoker tags based scheduling in the docs and that is some temporary fix for my use case, that is in 2.0.0 and not 1.0.0.\r\n\r\nBut bigger concern is my limited understanding of warm containers reuse amongst different actions. Where do I get more information about this? Is this the intentional way warm containers reuse is supposed to run?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/2356404420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/2356474466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5510#issuecomment-2356474466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5510","id":2356474466,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc6MdPJi","user":{"login":"bdoyle0182","id":11879547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODc5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11879547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182","html_url":"https://github.com/bdoyle0182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdoyle0182/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-17T17:11:39Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T17:12:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 3.

If your container pool is full and no functions exist for Action B, you need to evict an Action A in order to cold start an Action B.\r\nBut also want to clarify that you shouldn't expect containers to get reused for multiple actions. Once a container is bound to an action, it can only run executions of that action even if it's using the same runtime and memory profile; there are many reasons for this but most importantly is security and data isolation.\r\n\r\nYou will find that performance should be significantly better on Openwhisk 2.0 with the new scheduler for the traffic pattern you're trying to test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/2356474466/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/2356970379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/5510#issuecomment-2356970379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/5510","id":2356970379,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxoOzc6MfIOL","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-17T21:29:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T21:30:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think @bdoyle0182 comment hits the root of the confusion.
