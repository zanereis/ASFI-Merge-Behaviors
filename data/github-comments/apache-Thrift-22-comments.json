to anyone using this, I'm making a pretty decent sized change right now to how `TEnums` work with Swift Enums.  Backstory is that Swift enums are overly opinionated and don't work well if a new enum value is added to a service and the client hasn't updated.\r\n\r\nOther languages handle this pretty easily since enums are just Ints to them, they simply read and store the value even if it doesn't match a case.  Since Swift's enums are finite and opinionated, and not backed by Ints, this posed a bit of a challenge.  I initially designed the TEnums to be RawRepresentable Int32 since it just made sense at the time, this let the library handle read/write generically and the generator only needed to declare the cases and an empty init case.  The problem arose when we saw it failing when new values came in.  Granted it was designed to do so, but we needed a way internally to gracefully handle that.\r\n\r\nAs a replacement, I'm removing the RawRepresentable/Int32 requirement on TEnums, and removing the protocol read from the library as well, they will retain a rawValue and init(rawValue:) to facilitate serialization and maintain compatibility with code that may be already using those, but they're no longer inherently RawRepresentable.  The reason for this decision was to add an `.unknown(Int32)` case that retains the extra value.  \r\nThis is an opt-in case, so you'll need to use the generator flag `safe_enums`, but this way you don't lose that information, and in the likely event you'll pull something that has an unknown enum value and then need to send it back to a service, you'll retain the appropriate value and maintain compatibility between server/client version mismatch.\r\n\r\nThis is a psuedo-breaking change, meaning that to use the generator after this commit you'll need to update the library version you're pointing to, similarly if you update the library you'll need to update the generator and regenerate code, it should however not affect any other code outside of

As I was hoping the build would fail with the test case before submitting, as this is what we've used for testing it under valgrind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently cross compile builds runs with ubuntu 1404 trusty. For thrift as a project you might consider trying to maybe bump this dependency, as maintenance updates for 1404 is more or less going away this year according to https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life . \r\n\r\nYou will also need min 1604 for php7 packages. Sadly the test suite really doesn't run with newer versions, at least python tests seems to start failing. Another problem is the system tests with (cross-compile) doesn't use cmake yet, which seems to have an idea about being able to select which libraries you want to include in the build. \r\n\r\nAlso note that PHP5 != PHP7 , and you probably want to focus new development towards PHP7. http://php.net/supported-versions.php . \r\n\r\nIdeally CI should maybe build with latest distros where developers hang and live :-)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, me and @zhaakhi rolled out this in production for our systems and haven't noticed any segfaults since we deployed it 24 hours ago. But we did revert https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1215 in our fork that we have deployed, since we noticed memory leaks from it. Unsure if it was due to me  not ensuring newer thrift compiler under testing, but didn't want to risk it. I've also left a note about it in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-4126 .
