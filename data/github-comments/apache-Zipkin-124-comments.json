While this sounds intuitive, it won't work with the spring-cloud-netflix code. Basically getInstances does *not* take a service name, and in the case of eureka it is a VIP address.

main issue is SASI is disabled by default in cassandra 4. So, and you need to find a way to enable that (probably bring your own yaml). If this is just for testing, of course you can use our image which already does this.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I don't know a way to detect if SASI is enabled at runtime, to create a better message when it isn't. Someone can teach me a way or better yet, contribute a way (I personally have never used cassandra in prod, I am just trying to help anyway)\r\n\r\nSadly there aren't any active cassandra experts on this project anymore. Plus, I have also failed to even get small patches to cassandra code landed. So, I would suggest contacting someone in cassandra ecosystem directly about what seems a very common problem that there's no way to enable SASI by default again without hassle. You will probably be told no (like everyone else) as they believe yaml should be the only way and properties disallowed :shrug:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1970192622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1970193657","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3740#issuecomment-1970193657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3740","id":1970193657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc51bsT5","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-29T01:04:05Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T01:04:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FWIW it wasn't about this, it was that sasi is disabled by default (added in 3.x enabled by default, and then disabled in 4.x with no property override!)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1970193657/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1970265730","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3412#issuecomment-1970265730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3412","id":1970265730,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc51b96C","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-29T02:04:44Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T02:04:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we can check this heuristically.

Sorry for your frustration over the frontend changes. Maybe I can come up with a solution this evening or I'll try it this weekend.\r\n\r\n@SamTV12345 the main frustration is that I am not good at it, so for example, it takes as long as me to troubleshoot something simple on the JS side vs supporting a new version of cassandra or something. Also, each and any frontend related PR tends to need a lot of feedback to merge, which again is the same effort I would usually spend on a new feature. Sometimes over several days.. So there's displacement and a lot of time with each thing, often unplanned because I'm not aware there is a problem until someone notices..\r\n\r\nThanks for giving it a stab, please do run the docker/examples/README example for the UI after the fix to make sure this still works. I'll do that when you say it is working as well. Once whatever is merged that doesn't break the UI example, the ghcr.io/openzipkin/zipkin:master tag can be updated and @ujo-trackunit can verify.\r\n\r\nIf it turns out we can't sort this by early next week, I will raise a PR to revert vite and make a patch release that gets the UI working again, then raise a shared branch with vite again. This is surely not my preference, as it makes more work in the future to finish that. However, we can't leave this broken as it was a feature for many years.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1972097735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/1972099947","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3744#issuecomment-1972099947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3744","id":1972099947,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc51i9tr","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-29T22:45:32Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T22:45:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"the problem with this one was that it broke the zipkin-ui test in docker/examples which uses the other property.

However, it is worth considering that they are probably more focused on accessibility themes, being widely used products. Windows 10/11 has introduced the \"Contrast\" mode at the operating system level, but it follows quite specific and very different guidelines from those I followed for the \"High Contrast\" theme. In fact, high contrast themes generally do not have a wide color palette and prefer black and white (or yellow) as colors.\r\n\r\nHere is a great article that explains the benefits of the high contrast theme: \r\nhttps://uxdesign.cc/high-contrast-when-you-think-the-dark-mode-is-enough-d190218d4bba\r\n\r\nWith that said, the high contrast theme I proposed slightly improves the background text contrast for colored elements, compared to the standard theme.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1136\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 alle 09 02 44\" src=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/assets/23033509/f468f71b-f34d-45b2-87ad-6974d1796c86\">\r\n<img width=\"1136\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 alle 09 02 18\" src=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/assets/23033509/011be500-114d-4171-8e85-c88a71c7f511\">\r\n\r\nI don't see major difficulties in maintaining the contrast theme as it is now, being very similar to the light theme (maintaining the dark theme is much more difficult).\r\n\r\nI preferred to keep a separate theme because I did not want to drastically change the original colors of the product. For example, the contrast theme has a more limited number of colors for high contrast services with the text and also contrast between them, but honestly for a person who does not have disabilities, the original color palette has nicer colors to look at.\r\n\r\nA third option could be a hybrid one, which only retains the light and dark modes and slightly modifies the light one:\r\n\r\n-  Change the primary color to that of the High Contrast theme\r\n-  Change the secondary color and the danger color to those of the High Contrast theme\r\n-  Keep the original palette for services.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that if a service has a sufficiently long name, in the Traces section, the service name is not fully visible within the colored label. In this case, the choice of color can be marginal.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2031282698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2031556751","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3755#issuecomment-2031556751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3755","id":2031556751,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc55FxiP","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-02T09:49:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T09:49:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So, to clarify the problem of maintenance in the UI is historical.

Do you think a translation for \"Light\" and \"Dark\" is necessary, or should we leave it in English for all languages?

For this reason, I was a bit surprised to still see a lot of code here even when simplifying to two themes. However, now I can see that this change is needed and well described in the README.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, we still have a decision to make as the top bar is cluttered, and unlike most dashboards:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-03 at 07 24 52](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/assets/64215/042aeea8-33f5-48a9-90d9-0498fc0d81c1)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-03 at 07 22 34](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/assets/64215/3fb1c55a-39e4-4bca-bba0-d94c4af7c636)\r\n\r\nMost of the time, there is a settings button or implicitly if you click the logo to drag settings on the left. We cannot continue to add stuff into the top bar, and this feature dominates the top bar more than zipkin's core functions.\r\n\r\nI think there are at least 3 ways out of this, in complexity order\r\n\r\n1. only use 'prefers-color-scheme' from the environment and remove the selection completely. This is the least code to maintain and it is easy to explain that if you want dark mode, set your browser or OS to dark mode.\r\n2. make a much smaller toggle, similar to the one in the [hello-friend theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/) in hugo, and put it at the far right hand corner. This still clutters, but to a lesser degree since it is a small icon not literally \"high contrast\" \r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-03 at 07 39 46](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/assets/64215/016fede3-7b7e-4068-a872-26f68bd8fa75). \r\n3. move both light/dark selection and language selection into the normal \"settings\" style dropdown (of course an icon to represent settings, not literally spelled out as settings).\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm not asking for comments and testing now, is to reduce your burden during revisions. Once this is in final shape, we'll need to add unit tests for selection logic, or anything that is likely to break if the UI component library switched later. (Historically, those who create features in the UI are not around to maintain them. This has resulted in me spending literally hours on small things I don't understand)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2033288596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2034968415","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3755#issuecomment-2034968415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3755","id":2034968415,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc55Sydf","user":{"login":"giaroc","id":23033509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDMzNTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23033509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc","html_url":"https://github.com/giaroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-03T15:44:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T15:44:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, I actually agree about the topbar. Personally, I always prefer having the option to choose, and generally, most products, whether they are well-known products like Zipkin or those that have a completely different use case, allow you to change the option at will (or might add an option that follows your browser settings). Which path would you prefer to take? As for option 2 or 3, the second would require very little work. The third, however, would necessitate some reworking of the topbar, so there would be a few more lines of code involved.
