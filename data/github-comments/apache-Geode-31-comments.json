initially planned on adding a unit test to ProxyBucketRegionTest but it looked like ProxyBucketRegion would need to refactoring to get the advisor mockable. It uses a static method in the constructor to create the advisor and that static method is passed the partially constructed ProxyBucketRegion and uses some of its state to create the advisor. Since this is correcting a problem introduced by a refactoring that did not have tests, by undoing one of the changes, I think it is okay to not have test coverage for this pull request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/481465607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/481477590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3435#issuecomment-481477590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3435","id":481477590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQ3NzU5MA==","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-09T23:31:38Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T23:31:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What part of this change actually makes the test not dependent on /etc/hosts?

For the case of a stat that goes to micrometer but not VSD (why not just also send it to VSD, btw?) you could still add a method to GatewaySenderStats for that stat. Or StatisticsTypeFactory.createXXXCounter could in addition to taking a parameter indicating that something should go to micrometer, also indicate the stat doesn't need to go to VSD.\r\n\r\n> So… if the intentions of a stat and a meter are to measure exactly the same thing, yeah, let's take advantage of that.\r\n\r\nThis should most of this micrometer work much easier and less error prone as well. Once you add some support in StatisticsFactory for micrometer, for any new stat that goes to micrometer you will just need to touch objects like GatewaySenderStats and add a flag or whatever during the statistics type creation indicating the stat should go to micrometer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/484239560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/484252848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3467#issuecomment-484252848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3467","id":484252848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDI1Mjg0OA==","user":{"login":"moleske","id":12620096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIwMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12620096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske","html_url":"https://github.com/moleske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moleske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T20:40:33Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T20:40:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> (why not just also send it to VSD, btw?)\r\n\r\nI believe that in general, when adding micrometer based metrics, we are not trying to change or enhance VSD based information.  The idea being that we will remove VSD once micrometer is providing all the metrics that VSD has.  This does not mean we couldn't add to VSD, but VSD is not tool of choice moving forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/484252848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/484267133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3480#issuecomment-484267133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3480","id":484267133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDI2NzEzMw==","user":{"login":"agingade","id":8432880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzI4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8432880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade","html_url":"https://github.com/agingade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-17T21:24:15Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T21:24:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Is there already a test for this?\r\n\r\nYes.
