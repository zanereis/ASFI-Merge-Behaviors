If even the number of output box are different, then it must be a NMS issue, since NMS is the only thing that could change the number of box. I'm also fine if we can get the same output as the latest pytorch.\r\n\r\nThanks for validating my fix. Luckily, I also found a way to parallelize the inner loop of GPU NMS which should give a massive speedup. The change is this one https://github.com/masahi/tvm/commit/c75c6ef00b1e89d6a6698aeb8048be6e6f13c0ff but since I'm away from my GPU at the moment, I haven't tested yet. It also reduces the number of IOU tests from O(N ** 2) to O (# selected boxes * N). \r\n\r\nHopefully next week I can send a PR with good perf improvement on GPU NMS and hence PyTorch MaskRCNN performance on GPU.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/751300057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/751302259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7137#issuecomment-751302259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7137","id":751302259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTMwMjI1OQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-26T00:13:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-26T00:13:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @masahi @kevinthesun @yongwww ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/751302259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/751308421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7168#issuecomment-751308421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7168","id":751308421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTMwODQyMQ==","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-26T01:51:51Z","updated_at":"2020-12-26T01:51:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@FrozenGene  comments are resolved","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/751308421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/751349881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6137#issuecomment-751349881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6137","id":751349881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTM0OTg4MQ==","user":{"login":"Wheest","id":16022573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDIyNTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16022573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest","html_url":"https://github.com/Wheest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wheest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-26T12:08:56Z","updated_at":"2020-12-26T12:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure thing, thanks for reviewing!

I agree that it might be worth to discuss if a `sparse` namespace is needed although there are already some sparse operators in the code base without using the new namespace.\r\n\r\nHowever, I personally don't think we need to over complicate the process of implementing operators (e.g. comparing across all frameworks) as well, which is also not the process we have taken to implement other operators.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it may be impractical and/or inefficient to use existing operators to implement some TF/PT ops IMHO. Particularly, there are not that many sparse op in relay to compose a synthetic TF op. \r\n\r\n@codeislife99 could you summarize the discussion so that we can have agreements on all points to move forward?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/752310779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/752374930","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7181#issuecomment-752374930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7181","id":752374930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MjM3NDkzMA==","user":{"login":"leowang1225","id":28951026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTUxMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28951026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225","html_url":"https://github.com/leowang1225","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leowang1225/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-30T08:36:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T08:36:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Signed-off-by: leowang1225 [810916296@qq.com](mailto:810916296@qq.com)\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for contributing to TVM!

of these PRs: The goal of adding these sparse ops is to enable a customer to run their recommendation model which is currently getting split into multiple subgraphs because of our non-coverage of this op. \r\n\r\nI had an offline discussion with the main reviewers but I will also try to summarize the conclusions from it and the comments here:\r\n1. New namespace : Further discussion will be had in a separate thread, after the current (this one included) sparse ops PRs are merged, since there are a few already existing sparse ops without the namespace and if a new namespace is necessary all the current + previous sparse ops will be put in it. \r\n2. Documentation : More documentation has been added \r\n3. High level Approach like XLA: Discussion in a separate thread \r\n4. This operation is TF specific.

My impression is that it launches one thread block per segment. This sounds great when there are many segments to sort and each of segment is not so big. I'm not sure if that is a good fit for our use case - I think we are more likely to sort a few, but large segments, and most likely we only have one segment.
