In the partitioned case, there seem to be a lot of potential for messing things up in complicated and hard to foresee ways.\n\nFor example, if I always emit the partition with the least number of segments, then what will actually happen is that I will kinda always emit the same partition (because after an emit, it starts from a \"disadvantage\" compared to the others), and the others just keep growing until they eat all the memory, so this degenerates into the situation where there isn't a single memory segment left for the smallest one and _bad things_ happen.\n\nIn contrast, an advantage of the current design is that its performance characteristics are not that hard to grok, and it is relatively straightforward to see how the sizes of the 3 memory regions (bucket segments, record segments, staging segments) relate to each other.\n\nBtw. I think I figured out a simple way to do even the final reduce with the spilling without partitioning the memory: when memory is full I write everything to disk, and I partition only at this time, by writing to different files (the same files across multiple spillings, so eg. the second spilling appends to the same files as the first one created), and then when the input ends, I recurse on processing the files one by one (and I start a new level of partitioning).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182872207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182872698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1600#issuecomment-182872698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1600","id":182872698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mjg3MjY5OA==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T13:48:20Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T13:48:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske I fixed the aggregation hashCode and enables the ignored tests.

IMO, the gains are very little compared to the added code complexity. Given a POJO input, we can preserve the input type only for very few operations such as a Filter. For most other operations, we need to generate a new output type (Tuple or Row). I am a bit skeptical about adding a lot of codeGen code with special cases for POJOs (such as the field index mapping) which is very seldom used. Moreover, POJO field accesses (for operations and serialization) go through reflection and are not very efficient. So even the performance gain for those few cases where POJOs can be used is not clear.\n\nI do not question the native type support in general. Tuples and primitives should definitely be supported, but I don't think we need to support POJOs within Table / SQL operators. Instead, I would convert POJO datasets into Row tables during table scan. Most of the code in this PR can be used to implement a codeGen'd converter Map function.\n\nWhat do you think @twalthr?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/183251312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/183268426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1624#issuecomment-183268426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1624","id":183268426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzI2ODQyNg==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-12T10:45:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-12T10:45:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @fhueske,\n\nI completely share your opinion.

If an explicit `RestartStrategy` is set for a job, it is taken. \n2. Otherwise it is checked whether the number of retries and retry delay has been set at the `ExecutionEnvironment`/`ExecutionConfig`. If this is the case, then a `FixedDelayRestartStrategy` is instantiated with these values.  \n3. If no explicit `RestartStrategy` has been defined for the job, then the default restart strategy of the `JobManager` is used. The default restart strategy is defined the following way:\n4. If the configuration contains a configuration value `restart-strategy`, then this defines the used `RestartStrategy`.\n5. If `restart-strategy` is not set, then the old `execution-retries.default` and `execution-retries.delay` configuration values are checked. If they are set with `execution-retries.default > 0` and `execution-retries.delay >= 0`, then a `FixedDelayRestartStrategy` is instantiated with the respective values. This is then used as the default restart strategy.

If we accept the change in the object reuse contract of `MergeIterator.next(reuse)` introduced by 0a8df6d513fa59d650ff875bdf3a1613d0f14af5, all the call sites can potentially have the same problem as the reduce drivers, so we should check all of these 271 places. For example, just by skimming the list for a few minutes, all the 8 calls in `CrossDriver` seem suspicious at first glance, as well as the calls in `UnionWithTempOperator`, `MutableHashTable.ProbeIterator.next`, and `ReusingBuildFirstHashJoinIterator.callWithNextKey`.\n\nMy alternative solution [3] has the drawback that it would introduce an extra copying in `MergeIterator.HeadStream.getHead`, but would change the contract of `MergeIterator.next(reuse)` back to the same as it was before 0a8df6d513fa59d650ff875bdf3a1613d0f14af5.\n\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3291\n[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3291?focusedCommentId=15130452&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15130452\n[3] https://github.com/ggevay/flink/commit/b05e12075bb5d0518b6fe12cd8f7de1e6b16f805\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/183287868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/183288223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1524#issuecomment-183288223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1524","id":183288223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzI4ODIyMw==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-12T11:33:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-12T11:33:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you.\n- `./bin/yarn-session.sh -tm 1024 -n 7 -s 2 -Dfs.default-scheme=hdfs:///` is now working\n- Setting the fs.default-scheme to `thisIsWrong` and trying to read from `/user/robert/trashaa` leads to:\n\n```\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: The URI '/user/robert/trashaa' is invalid.

If didn't go through them yet, but would like to follow up on the discussion and propose a few potential improvements.\n\nI agree that using multiple partitions would make the implementation more complex and the reasoning about the behavior less straightforward. The motivation for partitions is twofold. First, it should helps to maintain a continuous data flow without backpressure effects. Second, it should improve the effectiveness of the combiner by avoiding to evict hot elements which are frequently updated which would happen for each full eviction of the table. Emitting the partition with the least segments wouldn't be a good strategy for the reasons you mentioned. However, a strategy could be to remove the partition with the smallest updates / keys ratio. However, this would require more thoughts…\n\nIndependent of the partitions discussion, I have a few ideas to make the compaction more effective. However, these would break the compatibility with the AbstractMutableHashTable interface. Maybe we can provide a common base class and special implementations for the SolutionSet case and the Combiner case?\n1. Remember a pointer to the hole which is closest to the start of the RecordArea (or partition).\n2. When compacting, emit all elements which are before the first hole. These elements are \"cold\" and have not been updated since the last compaction (assuming non-in-place updates, but in-place updates should not be compacted anyways). Compact all elements after the first hole as usual. The benefit of this is to free more segments by compaction which delays (or even completely avoids) full eviction, and thus improving the compaction rate for hot elements.\n3. Do only compact if more than (for instance) 50% of space can be freed and do a full eviction otherwise. If there are too few holes in the table, most elements have not been touched (in case of non-in-place updates). Hence, we should just emit everything. \n\nWe can also think about adding a by-pass switch if the HT observes that the combiner does not help to significantly reduce the data (too many unique keys for not enough memory) but only adds additional overhead. For instance if the number of records is not reduced by 2x, we could simply forward the records to the collector (In case of partitions, this decision could be done on partition level).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/184167321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/184170079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1624#issuecomment-184170079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1624","id":184170079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDE3MDA3OQ==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-15T11:13:20Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T11:13:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @twalthr.
