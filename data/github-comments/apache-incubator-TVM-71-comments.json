I think the next step is to check if the problem persists when using a default schedule for the operator.\r\n\r\nOkay, this sounds good, although I'll need help with the details (unless you have an example close to what you are suggesting already).  It sounds like this would be a small unit test entirely in TVM (no NNVM or end-to-end CNN) that runs something like conv2d + relu on a simple test input tensor `ones(64,64,3)`?  We would make a small python script, then `build` for Android + Vulkan and run the test as a `C++` application on the device.  Right?\r\n\r\nMaybe the following TVM tutorial is a reasonable starting point?\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.tvm.ai/tutorials/topi/intro_topi.html#fusing-convolutions\r\n\r\nAre there other generic unit tests we should be running (in addition) to help test the Vulkan back-end on Android?  Maybe these https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/tests/cpp?\r\n\r\n[EDIT: It looks like [packed_func_test]( https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/tests/cpp/packed_func_test.cc) is the most relevant one, since it is limited to run time functionality: `#include <tvm/runtime/*>`.  Perhaps we can build on that?]","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453524523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453554879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2421#issuecomment-453554879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2421","id":453554879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzU1NDg3OQ==","user":{"login":"denis0x0D","id":25140014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQwMDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25140014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D","html_url":"https://github.com/denis0x0D","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis0x0D/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T15:31:13Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T16:11:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"By the way, here is a discussion about reciprocal instruction accuracy and performance https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21385\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453554879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453579833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2352#issuecomment-453579833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2352","id":453579833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzU3OTgzMw==","user":{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T16:44:13Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T16:44:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jroesch any update?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453579833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453585972","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2355#issuecomment-453585972","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2355","id":453585972,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzU4NTk3Mg==","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T17:02:29Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T17:03:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, your understanding is correct. That TVM tutorial should be almost exactly what we need. In this case, we would manually schedule the fused convolution (as minimally as possible) instead of relying on a built-in TOPI schedule.\r\nIf you have a C++ function deploy flow on device, we can use that, but otherwise it would be simpler to just use the RPC server so that we can make changes quickly without rebuilding anything manually for the device.\r\n\r\nI am not sure we need to use the packed function test, because more basic functions (e.g., vector-add, or even un-fused conv2d would tell us that the runtime is working at a more primitive level).\r\n\r\nBasically the purpose of this is to see if the problem lies within the schedule somewhere, or occurs any time we invoke fusion. I hope it is not a corner case where a specific schedule + fusion are needed to trigger it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453585972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/453609112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2422#issuecomment-453609112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2422","id":453609112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzYwOTExMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T18:18:20Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T18:18:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks,
