The reason is:\n1. not all DEBUG messages are useless, sometimes meaningful DEBUG msg could benefit debugging ERRORs, we can just get rid of DEBUG log dumping, only keep DEBUG message that we're interested of, such as eagle's.\n2. this way of ignoring messy DEBUG msg is just to let spring and apache-commons components log above INFO level by default, separated from rootLogger's DEBUG so that we will have more flexible controls on logs of different components.\n\nDo these make
