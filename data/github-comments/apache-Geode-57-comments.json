I'm not sure if we want to change all INCR/DECR related commands to parse BigIntegers or BigDecimals? (If we did, then we wouldn't have to worry about the max/min 64 bit signed integer value tests... it would be different from Redis, but we are already different due to the change in `INCRBYFLOAT`)\r\n> \r\n> **Update:** Jens told me BigDecimals were used in `INCRBYFLOAT` so that floating point would be more accurate... and keeping long for other INCR/DECR ops will be faster performance-wise. So unless we think there's a strong use case (maybe page view count?) or selling point for being able to INCR/DECR larger values than Redis, maybe that change doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nI think that in this case we should favor performance over consistency with another command, especially since that command isn't consistent with native redis. thank you for looking into that though","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/777691542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/778117134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5970#issuecomment-778117134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5970","id":778117134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3ODExNzEzNA==","user":{"login":"alb3rtobr","id":5363407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr","html_url":"https://github.com/alb3rtobr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-12T10:38:26Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T10:38:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Docs look good.

This would them be part of longer term refactoring to improve the codebase with interfaces and is similar to the many other internal interfaces that we've been adding including `InternalRegion` and `InternalCache`. Note that we tend to not parameterize these internal interfaces.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments.

Queries that use the base compact range index should still be able to execute != in a timely fashion.\r\n> > > > \r\n> > > > \r\n> > > > I created the test in order to compare queries with and without indexes. Nevertheless, I think that currently queries without indexes do not give the right results with where clauses in which the map for the key passed is compared with null, for example: \"positions['SUN'] != null\" or \"positions['SUN'] = null. In these cases for entries that contain the map (positions != null) but positions does not contain the \"SUN\" key, it considers that positions['SUN'] is null.\r\n> > > > I have changed the code in the latest commits to work the way I expected.\r\n> > > > Besides, I have added a change so that indexes are used again when using CompactRangeIndexes but not when using CompactMapRangeIndexes.\r\n> > > > There's only 3 test cases that are failing and I still need to investigate.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > The cases that are failing try to create the following index:\r\n> > > pf.collectionHolderMap[(pf.ID).toString()].arr[pf.ID]\r\n> > > They also fail if the index is: pf.collectionHolderMap[(pf.ID).toString()]\r\n> > > I wonder what type of index is that. According to the documentation, when you create a Map index you specify either \"*\" in order to create an index for every key or one or more keys (v.g. \"SUN\", IBM\",...) but in those cases the index contains something variable.\r\n> > > Does it make sense to support it given that there is no such thing in the documentation?\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > pf.collectionHolderMap[(pf.ID).toString()] <= I think(not 100% sure) this can be considered equivalent to entry.mapField[\"ID value as key\"] So similar to a map index\r\n> > pf.collectionHolderMap[(pf.ID).toString()].arr[pf.ID] <= I think is a map index where the value that is mapped happens to be an array.

What is not that clear is what type of index is created because neither a fixed value nor \"*\" is used as a key to the map but rather a variable.

made.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/791335022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/791505020","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5915#issuecomment-791505020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5915","id":791505020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MTUwNTAyMA==","user":{"login":"jhutchison","id":1131716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE3MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1131716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison","html_url":"https://github.com/jhutchison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T15:50:17Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T15:50:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this
