a bit mixed.

Othere places modify the stylesheet of a single document and not for the whole kit:\r\n\r\n- subversion/src/org/netbeans/modules/subversion/util/NotifyHtmlPanel.java                                                  \r\n- subversion/src/org/netbeans/modules/subversion/options/SvnOptionsPanel.java\r\n- subversion/src/org/netbeans/modules/subversion/client/MissingClientPanel.java\r\n- openide.awt/src/org/openide/awt/SwingBrowserImpl.java\r\n\r\nThey either just set base styles of add a filtering layer (SwingBrowserImpl).\r\n\r\nMy take on this: If we want to change the base styles of the HTMLEditorKit, this should be done by one module and I think the `org.netbeans.swing.plaf` (Look & Feel Customization Library) would be the correct place for that. That way we won't get race-conditions for the customizations. If a module needs an individual styling, the stylesheet can be changed on the document level.\r\n\r\n@eirikbakke would you be willing to have a closer look at this? I know that I just turned a small problem into a discussion point, but I think bringing it up is the best option.\r\n\r\nIf a local option is desired, I would check if the stylesheet of the single document that is used, is reset in `HTMLDocView#setContent`. If the stylesheet stays, I think it would be good to change the document stylesheet. If it is reset, it is IMHO worth checking whether resetting the stylesheet each time is an option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/378016418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/378031405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/437#issuecomment-378031405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/437","id":378031405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODAzMTQwNQ==","user":{"login":"eirikbakke","id":886243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NjI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/886243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke","html_url":"https://github.com/eirikbakke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirikbakke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-02T20:16:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T20:16:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Matthias, let me see if I can manage to understand your comment. Am I correct that this is an objection to the _existing_ use of  \"css.addStyleSheet(htmlKit.getStyleSheet())\" that is currently present in HTMLDocView.setBodyFontInCSS?\r\n\r\nIs there globally shared state here that that I am not aware of? It seems the HTMLEditorKit instance that is modified in \"css.addStyleSheet(htmlKit.getStyleSheet())\" in HTMLDocView belongs to that HTMLDocView instance only. But there's a comment in HTMLDocView saying \"the style sheet is shared by all HTMLEditorKits\". Is that the problem here?\r\n\r\nAlso note that the stylesheet change here is context-sensitive--depending on which editor the documentation popup is opened for, the font size may be different. Should the tweak still, in your opinion, be located in org.netbeans.swing.plaf ?\r\n\r\nI probably do not have enough familiarity with the related code to do a large refactoring

However, in contrary to @matthiasblaesing, I don't think it will cause any confusion. Talk to any **Java EE** developer out there and ask him what **frontend** means. There is going to be unison answer: it means an application running in a browser or in a WebView component (on desktop or mobile phone) written using CSS/DOM/etc.\r\n\r\nThe term **frontend** has been kidnapped by the JavaScript camp few years ago. It no longer means Swing or SWT, it only means DOM, CSS & co. Everyone not deeply knowledgable of Java will expect that **frontend** means exactly this kind of app. From this point of view I find *Java Frontend Application* a perfect fit! Btw. nice idea, Toni!\r\n\r\nOf course \"DukeScript Application\" would exactly describe what is going on. But I have to (again) quote our usability study: Dmitry pointed out when trying to use the wizard that a proper name for the wizard is needed:\r\n\r\n> Select: File -> New Project -> JavaFX -> Java HTML5 Application (again,\r\n> only because I knew from this thread where to click)\r\n> Read description: \"Generates a WebView based DukeScript application\".\r\n>\r\n>   DukeScript? WebView based?... huh...\r\n\r\nIf Toni wants to use \"DukeScript application\", fine with me, he invented the brand and he may have emotional attachments to the name.

My patch seems much shorter and does the same (or not?). I'm not certain what your refactoring adds -- it anything it introduces complexity.\r\n\r\n*But*, if I were to refactor, I'd take into account that `SplitAction` is registered in `mf-layer.xml` under `Menu/View`.\r\n\r\nIdeally, since we have standalone actions now for each horizontal split / vertical split / clear action then we should create\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<folder name=\"Menu\">\r\n        <folder name=\"View\">\r\n            <folder name=\"Split\">\r\n                <attr bundlevalue=\"org.netbeans.core.multiview.Bundle#CTL_SplitAction\" name=\"displayName\"/>\r\n             </folder>\r\n```\r\nand register your `SplitDocumentHorizontallyAction` and `SplitDocumentVerticallyAction` with an `@ActionReference` under `path = \"Menu/View/Split\"`.\r\n\r\n*Then* you have to take into account that `SplitAction` seems to have a toggle via `isSplitingEnabled` and that the actions are enabled/disabled based on the activated TopComponent.\r\n\r\nOf course, what's missing with using the layer is that you cannot disable the whole `View/Split` menu if it's a layer folder.\r\n\r\nSo, as far as refactoring go it seems you stopped too early. In which case it seems better not to refactor anything and keep the patch more minimal.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I would like to conclude with this PR. It seems to have taken forever.\r\n\r\nI also don't want to be nitpicking and stop progress. So, I'm going to unsubscribe from this PR.

However, in contrary to @matthiasblaesing <https://github.com/matthiasblaesing> , I don't think it will cause any confusion. Talk to any Java EE developer out there and ask him what frontend means. There is going to be unison answer: it means an application running in a browser or in a WebView component (on desktop or mobile phone) written using CSS/DOM/etc.\n\nThe term frontend has been kidnapped by the JavaScript camp few years ago. It no longer means Swing or SWT, it only means DOM, CSS & co. Everyone not deeply knowledgable of Java will expect that frontend means exactly this kind of app. From this point of view I find Java Frontend Application a perfect fit! Btw. nice idea, Toni!\n\nOf course \"DukeScript Application\" would exactly describe what is going on. But I have to (again) quote our usability study: Dmitry pointed out when trying to use the wizard that a proper name for the wizard is needed:\n\nSelect: File -> New Project -> JavaFX -> Java HTML5 Application (again,\nonly because I knew from this thread where to click)\nRead description: \"Generates a WebView based DukeScript application\".\n\nDukeScript? WebView based?... huh...\n\nIf Toni wants to use \"DukeScript application\", fine with me, he invented the brand and he may have emotional attachments to the name. But then the pull request only fixes the category problem and ignores the usability study result with respect to the name - people won't even bother with the wizard, as its name won't sound similar in any way.\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/pull/466#issuecomment-378908050> , or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACBIN7Jl2QEXD66oHV0gQjJoYei78XvTks5tlgM1gaJpZM4S6Nw6> .  <https://github.com/notifications/beacon/ACBIN-H0pPURtukL65KhLT32tQMA2fIqks5tlgM1gaJpZM4S6Nw6.gif> \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/379188068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/379258199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/466#issuecomment-379258199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/466","id":379258199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTI1ODE5OQ==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-06T13:46:55Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T13:46:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I love the \"html4j\" term...\r\n\r\nI had also thought it would have been the best, but the problem with **html4j** is that it is **HTML5**, not **4**!

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/381851991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/381852562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/506#issuecomment-381852562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/506","id":381852562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTg1MjU2Mg==","user":{"login":"jtulach","id":1842422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1842422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach","html_url":"https://github.com/jtulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-17T05:48:36Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T05:48:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/381852562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/381854918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/492#issuecomment-381854918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/492","id":381854918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTg1NDkxOA==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-17T05:58:18Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T05:58:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"CC
