For MinPy project, our initial design goals include 3 parts: (1) dynamic autograd; (2) fully-compatible numpy support; (3) transparent integration with MXNet's symbolic programming so one-style-achieves-all. During the process, we learned three things:\r\n\r\n* We initially intend to release MinPy as a separate package, but it seems that dynamic autograd is so popular (look at pytorch) that MXNet requires this feature very urgently. Therefore, we decide to merge the autograd feature into MXNet (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/contrib/autograd.py) by @ZihengJiang (one of MinPy's main contributors).\r\n* A good DNN model builder and an easy-to-use toolchain (initializer, updater, etc.) is crucial for fast development. MinPy's NN module is based on CS231n, which is not sophisticated enough for researches. Therefore, we spend a lot of efforts on a better model builder structure ( @piiswrong @sneakerkg and many others). The new package is developed directly in MXNet (also called NN) and now becomes Gluon.\r\n* Speed is a dominating factor for a DL framework. We found writing fine-grained operators in python yields many efficiency issues. Therefore, the MinPy team is focusing on Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to improve the efficiency (please stay tuned!).\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: Gluon (successor of NN package) will be our standard DNN model & solver package. MinPy will evolve more into two directions: (1) JIT functionality that can also benefit Gluon and other MXNet packages; (2) More compatible support for NumPy operators.\r\n\r\n@zzhang-cn ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/319403882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/319433630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/7276#issuecomment-319433630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7276","id":319433630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTQzMzYzMA==","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-01T17:05:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T17:05:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good to me.\r\nI have tested this script.

I can see the mapping between our currently defined enum `kDefaultStorage`, `kRowSparseStorage`, `kCSRStorage` and vectors `[<0, dense>, <1, dense>]`, `[<0, sparse>, <1, dense>]`, `[<0, dense>, <1, sparse>]`. I have a few questions regarding the proposal though:\r\n\r\n1. `kRowSparseStorage` mapps to `[<0, sparse>, <1, dense>]` only when the ndarray is 2D, but the enum `kRowSparseStorage` actually means **\"sparse in the first dim and dense in the rest of the dims\"**. It seems difficult to use a fixed-size vector to represent this generalized case for N-D tensors, where N is only known at runtime.\r\n\r\n2. Has this formalization been proven to work for any storage format? My concern is that if we want to add a storage format that cannot be formalized in the vector representation in the future, how do we deal with the exception?\r\n\r\n3. It is not clear to me that how [COO](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor) format fits in the scheme? It seems that this kind of storage format is not mentioned/considered in the
