I didn't have much time to look into it so far. It looks that the failure in `nnvm/tests/python/compiler/test_top_level4.py` is triggered by this type of fusion. I can reproduce it locally:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\n\r\ndata = relay.var(\"data\", relay.ty.TensorType((1, 32, 32, 3), \"float32\"))\r\ndata1 = relay.var(\"data1\", relay.ty.TensorType((1, 32, 32, 3), \"float32\"))\r\n\r\nlog = relay.log(data)\r\nc1 = relay.copy(data1)\r\nc2 = relay.copy(data1)\r\n\r\nfunc = relay.Function([data, data1],  relay.Tuple(tvm.convert([log, c1, c2])))\r\nfunc = relay.ir_pass.infer_type(func)\r\n\r\nwith relay.build_config(opt_level=3):\r\n    graph, lib, params = relay.build(func, target=\"llvm\")\r\n```\r\nThis gives me: `Assertion failed: (getOperand(0)->getType()->isFPOrFPVectorTy() && \"Invalid operand types for FCmp instruction\"), function AssertOK, file

The attribute of conv2d op does not have `channels` fields. \r\n\r\nThis is interesting because the shape(type) inference can guess the value of `channels` and run correctly. However, attributes cannot be changed during type inference. So the inference pass won't fill the guessed value back to attribute. Then the missing value causes this error in the TOPI dispatch. The error is not related to alter_op_layout.\r\n\r\nA quick fix from TOPI side is using the layout and shape arguments to deduce `channels` in this function, rather than get it from attributes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/478962576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/479084464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2952#issuecomment-479084464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2952","id":479084464,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTA4NDQ2NA==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-02T16:36:45Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T16:36:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mostafaelhoushi Could you report the bug in the issue first?

I am working on improvements so it may increase.\r\n\r\n@yzhliu \r\n* simple reduction: reduction ops that do not have reuse opportunity (e.g. softmax, argmin)\r\n* complex reduction: reduction ops that have reuse opportunity (e.g. matmul, conv2d)\r\n* direct compute: broadcast, elemwise, stencil computation, (e.g. relu, add)\r\n* location-tunable compute: the same as above. The difference is that `direct compute` computes at root, while `location-tunable compute` can computes at other nodes to increase locality.\r\n\r\n@tmoreau89 This is doable.

explained the problem related to AlterLayout in a duplicated issue #2947. Paste it here\r\n\r\nIt might be a bug of ONNX converter. The attribute of conv2d op does not have channels fields.\r\n\r\nThis is interesting because the shape(type) inference can guess the value of channels and run correctly. However, attributes cannot be changed during type inference. So the inference pass won't fill the guessed value back to attribute. Then the missing value causes this error in the TOPI dispatch. The error is not related to alter_op_layout.\r\n\r\nA quick fix from TOPI side is using the layout and shape arguments to deduce channels in this function, rather than get it from attributes.

Currently these meta-templates are mainly based on the summary of existing human schedule code in TOPI. So adding a new backend is still hard. What can be reused is the classification of compute type.\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun There is only one template for one specific op. The auto-scheduler first creates this template. Then, for static usage, it will fill the knobs in the template according to hardware paremeters. The API example shown above falls in this category. For tuning usage, the auto-scheduler won't use hardware parameters. Instead, it relies real tuning. In this case, you need to explicitly create `autotvm.Task`, `autotvm.Tuner` as what we do currently. An example is shown in the tutorial.\r\n\r\n@yzhliu The `tvm.compute` dsl is much easier to analyze than general Halide IR, because of its clean dependency relations and simple loop structures.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/479842520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/479949295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2956#issuecomment-479949295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2956","id":479949295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTk0OTI5NQ==","user":{"login":"derisavi","id":13456984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDU2OTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13456984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi","html_url":"https://github.com/derisavi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-04T15:37:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T15:37:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anijain2305 @MarisaKirisame @xqdan @yzhliu Please review.

The key concept here is in the graph tuner we need to **predict** the input/output shape/layout for each kernel. We can't use infer shape or other existing passes, since these are only doable when a group of schedules are selected. There might be a simple way to improve: add a new generic function in target op(such as conv2d), which takes a workload and a config, and returns the corresponding i/o shapes and layouts. Then graph tuner can extract all required information by traversing graph, and all those implementation details are hidden to user. The logic of how to generate layout transformations becomes operator/target agnostic in graph tuner and can have a uniform implementation. Also graph tuning for more than one kind of kernels(mobilenet) is naturally supported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480112965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480113925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2932#issuecomment-480113925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2932","id":480113925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDExMzkyNQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T00:57:40Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T00:57:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@masahi Does it make sense to add an function to check if a `Tensor` is included in the `Schedule`. `Compute_inline` is allowed only when it is in the Schedule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480113925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480117241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2932#issuecomment-480117241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2932","id":480117241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDExNzI0MQ==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T01:19:42Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T01:20:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhiics yeah, that will be a quick fix, but I want to understand why the scalar is not included in the schedule.

Thanks a lot for the input. One point of note for the TVM use-case is that the [TVM modules' thread pool already requires cooperation from the OS](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/rust/runtime/src/threading.rs#L132). In almost all (or maybe actually all?) cases, the TVM threads operate on mutually exclusive portions of the output; the operation also doesn't return until all threads have finished their tasks. Accordingly, it's not so important that the thread pool be trusted.\r\n\r\nTVM also doesn't make use of `fs` nor `net`, so really it's just a matter of threads.\r\n\r\nWith due respect to you and your fantastic `std` facade (and, trust me, there's plenty of that from my end :), the Fortanix programming model is so much simpler and more and flexible.

The JoinHandle is implemented using untrusted Mutex. I don't think their implementation could provide any trustworthiness. They bring too much uncertainty to the SGX environment. Personally, I strongly disagree with their implementation because they provide a LibOS-like Rust-SGX environment without any ability to control/audit the usercalls in compile time. It sounds like pushing the programmers to the edge of a cliff and say: you have the choice to not step forward. As an experienced researcher, you can hardly got away from the falling down because too much stuffs depends on their usercalls. The bad design is not desired by Fortanix, but a result of combining libstd to an environment without thread/fs/time/env/process/net. Similar runtimes such as webassembly are facing the same problem. I think you must know [pwasm-std](https://github.com/paritytech/pwasm-std). Parity create this to provide a real runtime for wasm instead of using the default one -- you can open a file in a .rs file and compile it to webassembly, which would triggers a runtime panic. \"if it builds, it works\" is not true today, due to a bad design of libstd.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480156261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480156718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2887#issuecomment-480156718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2887","id":480156718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDE1NjcxOA==","user":{"login":"dingelish","id":1870436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzA0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1870436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish","html_url":"https://github.com/dingelish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingelish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-05T05:53:11Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T05:53:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The current code of SGX_QUEUE (with rust-sgx-sdk) is not depending on untrusted Mutex -- it relies on sgx_spin to provide atomicity which keeps everything inside.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/480156718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
