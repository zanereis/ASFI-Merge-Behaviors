I did not know about it. I believe, the intent is same. I agree that the approach is different. We wanted to shield the user from interpreter settings.  \r\n\r\nThe approach in this change is to specify a property name and default value in the interpreter setting.  Users  can set a value  for the property. When the interpreter is created, then the user's property value is used as the interpreter setting. \r\nUser's properties are persisted. \r\nOne advantage of this approach is to use the same property across multiple interpreter settings.\r\nWe have been using this feature at our company for last 3 months and its been effective. \r\n\r\nI'll review ZEPPELIN-1338 carefully to understand the approach mentioned in that. Thanks again for letting me know of the related effort. Its good to know that its a feature needed by many. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/298479357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/298491402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2268#issuecomment-298491402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2268","id":298491402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODQ5MTQwMg==","user":{"login":"tinkoff-dwh","id":25951039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUxMDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25951039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh","html_url":"https://github.com/tinkoff-dwh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinkoff-dwh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T03:53:55Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T03:53:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready to review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/298491402/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/298509193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1761#issuecomment-298509193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1761","id":298509193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODUwOTE5Mw==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T06:37:40Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T06:37:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"#2264 was merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/298509193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/298509735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1674#issuecomment-298509735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1674","id":298509735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODUwOTczNQ==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T06:41:30Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T06:41:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let's close.
