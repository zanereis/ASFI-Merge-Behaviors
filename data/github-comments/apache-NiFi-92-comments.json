We can change it but doing so requires a far more thorough analysis of not just the typical build process but being able to do a full release cycle.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, however, to use '${project.version}' since the maven release plugin takes care of it so nicely.

At the moment you'll get a NoClassDefFoundError unless JUnit 4 happens to be on the test classpath (it won't be on the test classpath if you're using JUnit 5). That's because nifi-mock declares JUnit 4 with a \"provided\" scope, when there is nothing providing JUnit 4. It should be \"compile\" scope, because nifi-mock is making use of JUnit assertions in non-test code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/403320273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/403323630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2780#issuecomment-403323630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2780","id":403323630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzMyMzYzMA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-08T22:53:37Z","updated_at":"2018-07-08T22:53:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> (it won't be on the test classpath if you're using JUnit 5)\r\n\r\nThe global declaration for JUnit is JUnit 4.12.

We have to declare JUnit 4 as a dependency with \"test\" scope, and configure the Maven Dependency Plugin to force JUnit 4 as used to prevent it from being reported as a declared and unused dependency.

The issue was because the introduced `NiFiHostnameVerifier` did not evaluate wildcard entries properly. This patch fixes the immediate issue. \r\n\r\n**However**, wildcard certificates are not officially supported and are **not recommended** for use in a secure cluster environment. There are numerous disadvantages to using wildcard certificates, they have been actively discouraged in the past, and have worked to this point only out of luck. The Admin Guide will be updated to state this explicitly [NIFI-5399](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5399). \r\n\r\nDisadvantages of wildcard certificates for cluster:\r\n* we use certificate identities many times throughout the codebase to identify a node, and if the certificate simply presents a wildcard DN, that doesn’t resolve to anything (see [NIFI-5398](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5398))\r\n* you need to provide a custom node identity in your `authorizers.xml` for `*.whatever.com` because all proxy actions only resolve to the cert DN\r\n* no traceability into which node performed an action because they all resolve to the same DN\r\n* if you’re running multiple instances on the same machine using different ports to identify them, and you accidentally put `node1` hostname with `node2` port, it will resolve fine because it’s using the same certificate, but the host header handler will block it because the `node1` hostname is not listed as an acceptable `host` for `node2` instance (correctly)\r\n* if the cert is compromised, all nodes are compromised\r\n\r\nAdvantages of wildcard certificates for cluster:\r\n* nominally faster to deploy in dynamically-scaled clusters, however the NiFi TLS Toolkit automates the process of generating correctly-signed, uniquely-identified certificates in the proper format. The deployment script or process for adding a node should leverage this tool rather than use a repeated wildcard certificate. Using a wildcard in the SAN is fine as long as a unique value exists in the SAN as well.
