If we want to update a tensor in the graph, we may need to copy(will create an operator) the new value to the original tensor. Just like we use Axpy to update parameters. Another strategy is to swap pointers of the two blocks.\r\n```python\r\na = Tensor() # block1->ptr1->addr1\r\nb = Tensor() # block2->ptr2->addr2\r\na = b # inc ref_count of block2, copy the data(memory address, size etc.) in block2 to block1.\r\n# if the ref_count of block1 isn't equal to 1, this strategy will have some problems.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/637290809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/637350685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/716#issuecomment-637350685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/716","id":637350685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzM1MDY4NQ==","user":{"login":"chrishkchris","id":38325429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzI1NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38325429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris","html_url":"https://github.com/chrishkchris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishkchris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-02T07:35:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-02T07:35:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready

\r\n\r\nIssue reported here is for handling the error on the python API side and is particularly noticed for autograd.backward function. \r\n\r\nConsider the below example\r\n```\r\nfrom singa import autograd\r\nfrom singa import module\r\nfrom singa import opt\r\nfrom singa import tensor\r\nfrom singa import device\r\n\r\nclass MLP():\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.linear1 = autograd.Linear(3, 4)\r\n        self.linear2 = autograd.Linear(4, 3)\r\n    def forward(self,x):\r\n        y = self.linear1(x)\r\n        return self.linear2(y)\r\n    def loss(self, out, ty):\r\n        return autograd.softmax_cross_entropy(out, ty)\r\n    def optim(self, loss):\r\n        self.optimizer.backward_and_update(loss)\r\n    def set_optimizer(self, optimizer):\r\n        self.optimizer = optimizer\r\n\r\ndef train(model, x, t, dev=device.get_default_device(), epochs=100):\r\n    for i in range(epochs):\r\n        y = model.forward(x)\r\n        loss = autograd.mse_loss(y, t)\r\n        print(\"loss: \", loss)\r\n        sgd = opt.SGD()\r\n        for p, gp in autograd.backward(loss):\r\n            sgd.update(p, gp)\r\n

without any issues. However if we change the dimension of output tensor such that it does not match the model constructed, the error is noticed.

If we want to update a tensor in the graph, we may need to copy(will create an operator) the new value to the original tensor. Just like we use Axpy to update parameters. Another strategy is to swap pointers of the two blocks.\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> a = Tensor() # block1->ptr1->addr1\r\n> b = Tensor() # block2->ptr2->addr2\r\n> a = b # inc ref_count of block2, copy the data(memory address, size etc.) in block2 to block1.\r\n> # if the ref_count of block1 isn't equal to 1, this strategy will have some problems.\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nif the model is compiled and the graph is created, then we set do self.W=parameters[self.W.name] (reassign W to another tensor). \r\nSince the graph is created already, this reassignment will not be seen by the graph and the graph will use the original tensor.\r\nCan we generate a warning or error when a tensor attribute is reassigned to a new tensor by `__setattr__` when graph is on?

Otherwise the recorded time will include the waiting time.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I do not split the operator, a filling buffer operation will have the time profiled as the sum of :\r\n1. waiting for the NULL stream before start filling buffer 2. filling buffer\r\nIf there is no need to wait, then the time spent for 1 will be zero, but some it still need to wait. \r\n\r\nThe aims of the time profiling design is to figure out how much time actual time (excluding waiting time) we need for each operators, so in the future we may be able to do better scheduling.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all the \"waiting\" operation should be excluded from time profiling of operators.\r\n\r\nAlso, since there is no need to record the waiting time, I renamed all the waiting operators as \"waiting\" so that we don't time profiling for them\r\nhttps://github.com/chrishkchris/singa/blob/SINGA-510_2/src/core/scheduler/scheduler.cc#L292","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/640070499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/comments/640073996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/singa/pull/716#issuecomment-640073996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/716","id":640073996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDA3Mzk5Ng==","user":{"login":"XJDKC","id":32295829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjk1ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32295829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC","html_url":"https://github.com/XJDKC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XJDKC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-06T14:57:10Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T14:57:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You are right.

Type 2 is easier but Type 3 is harder.\r\nType 4 need to modify the c++ code, we'll consider it later.\r\nXh means the workload hours.\r\n\r\nSo the plan is:\r\n1. You should read the code of soonx.py under [dev branch](https://github.com/apache/singa/tree/dev). Because we have updated the soonx to support the re-training, so it's a little different from the old version.\r\n2. You try to add an operator at the `Type 1`, you may add a key in the SingaBackend._rename_operators, and if you need a function to modify the operator, add a key in the SingaBackend._special_operators to indicate such a function.\r\n3. Try to add the test cases to test your new operator, the test cases list at [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/onnx/backend/test/data/node), and you should check the code in test_onnx_backend.py. There are two patterns, the include pattern means the operators which do not in it will be excluded, and the exclude patterns will exclude the pattern in it.\r\n4. When you finish the Type 1, I guess you must have been familiar with the sonnx, so you can try the Type 2 and Type 3. These need you to add operators in `autograd.py`, you can read the code in it and add test cases in `test_operation.py`. In the `autograd.py`, you need to add a class with forward and backward functions. and you need to add a function to call the class's forward function. Don't forget to add test cases in `test_operation.py`. After you add the operator in the autograd, you can add it to the sonnx following the point 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nI know it's a little difficult at first. So I hope you don't be urgent to do, just read the code carefully first and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, please add your code to dev branch. And please skip the frontend code in sonnx.py, only read the backend one.
