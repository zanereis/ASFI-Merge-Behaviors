The `spring-security-saml` library included a number of dependencies that have had to be excluded, so I'm not surprised to see Xalan as another potential problem.  It looks like your most recent update to exclude Xalan resolves the problem with emojis?  That seems like the right solution.  @bbende implemented support for SAML, so he may have some additional insight on whether excluding Xalan could be a problem.  If we can verify that SAML support continues to work as expected with the exclusion of Xalan, then it sounds like we have a solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/832034269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/832040819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5012#issuecomment-832040819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5012","id":832040819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMjA0MDgxOQ==","user":{"login":"s9514171","id":23164757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY0NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23164757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171","html_url":"https://github.com/s9514171","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s9514171/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-04T15:41:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T15:41:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@exceptionfactory I have vertied in my environment, after I exclude the Xalan the flow emoji issue is resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/832040819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/832076294","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5034#issuecomment-832076294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5034","id":832076294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMjA3NjI5NA==","user":{"login":"jfrazee","id":47344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-04T16:29:15Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T16:29:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @jfrazee Good questions. I'm using the term \"Vault\" as implementation-specific shorthand for HashiCorp Vault (similar to Spring, which calls their HashiCorp Vault service simply \"Spring Vault\"). I understand there are other similar technologies with similar names, like Azure Key Vault, so that could be a point of confusion. My thought here was to provide a HashiCorp Vault-specific integration point, which can be used in multiple places (Sensitive Properties Providers, Controller Services/Processors, and even ParameterContext providers in the future). \r\n\r\nThat makes sense; it's util code to be used in the future in implementations of existing interfaces.\r\n\r\n> What do you think about renaming all of these to HashiCorpVault* to help reduce the confusion?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do think that'd be good, but I also realize it's a super annoying ask.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/832076294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/832331888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4723#issuecomment-832331888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4723","id":832331888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMjMzMTg4OA==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-05T00:04:02Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T00:04:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We're marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past few months.

I have a few uncheckpointed messages that get processed again and again when I restart the processor.\r\n> \r\n> I don't really understand how the graceful shutdown works in KCL, but it seems to me we have no chance to exit cleanly (I am always seeing ZOMBIE state in the record processor's shutdown callback).\r\n> Could you please double check it?\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n\r\n@turcsanyip I'd noticed ZOMBIE logs a few times and thought it seemed a \"normal\" thing for KCL (from what I could tell, but note I'm hardly a Kinesis/KCL expert). Taking a look around on the internet, there are many threads about people seeing this kind of behaviour in many different versions of the KCL, for example:\r\n* https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/108\r\n* https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/677\r\n* https://github.com/amazon-archives/amazon-kinesis-connectors/issues/10\r\n\r\nA common thing between these seems to be that the KCL settings likely need tweaking depending upon one's setup. With the ability to configure most KCL settings via Dynamic Properties on the processor, it's largely open for users to figure this out I guess depending upon their setup.\r\n\r\nThat said, a common theme seems to be the need to increase the `failoverTimeMillis` and/or `gracefulShutdownMillis` KCL settings, I've therefore added those to the `ConsumeKinesisStream` processor's properties to encourage users to investigate/tweak as required.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/834187070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/834542439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5053#issuecomment-834542439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5053","id":834542439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNDU0MjQzOQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-07T15:38:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T15:38:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM, tested with Java 8 and 11, verified the behavior exists in both before the PR and is no longer present when the PR is applied.

Looking through this i think ideas are sound. However, this is updating the `nifi-api` module, and once it's been released it's permanent. So we need to be extremely careful about anything that we put in there. Naming, Exceptions that should be thrown, and the correct level of abstraction. So I have some thoughts around this.\r\n\r\n- What this 'extension' is really doing has nothing to do with Auto-Loading. It has to do with sourcing the NAR's from some other location. And given the interface provided in the PR, things like `start()` and `stop()` don't make a lot of sense to me, to be honest. When I see that, I feel like the component should be starting some background thread or something maybe so that it can poll? But then the background thread is created elsewhere. I think what would be a more appropriate level of abstraction would be:\r\n```\r\npublic interface NarProvider {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Initializes the NAR Provider based on the given set of properties\r\n     */\r\n    void initialize(NarProviderInitializationContext context);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Performs a listing of all NAR's that are available.\r\n     */\r\n    Collection<String> listNars() throws IOException;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Fetches the NAR at the given location. The location should be one of the values returned by listNars().\r\n     */\r\n    InputStream fetchNarContents(String location) throws IOException;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd here, `NarProviderInitializlationContext` would perhaps just have a single method:\r\n```\r\nMap<String, String> getProperties();\r\n```\r\nBut this abstraction gives us the freedom to update it in the future.\r\n\r\nI also think it's important to consider how those properties get provided to the implementation. The way that we typically handle something like this within NiFi would be to have the framework look at `nifi.properties` and pull out the properties appropriate for the instance. So, perhaps we would look for any property that has the format:\r\n```\r\nnifi.library.nar.autoload.<name>.implementation\r\nnifi.library.nar.autoload.<name>.XYZ\r\n```\r\nAnd then build up a Map<String, String> where the key is the property name after <name> and the value is the property value. For example, if we have in nifi.properties:\r\n```\r\nnifi.library.nar.autoload.hdfs.implementation=org.apache.nifi.hdfs.FetchNarHdfs\r\nnifi.library.nar.autoload.hdfs.kerberos=username\r\nnifi.library.nar.autoload.hdfs.hello=world\r\n```\r\nThis would produce a Map that could be provided to the `initialize` method (via the context):\r\n            kerberos => username\r\n            hello => world\r\n(No need to include `implementation` necessarily because it's used by the framework to know the name of the class to use but doesn't really need to be passed to the class itself).\r\n\r\nA few additional thoughts on the implementation:\r\n- With this approach, we only need to have extensions for determining what's available and downloading it. The Auto-Loader should not be pluggable, and it should be responsible for calling out to each NarProvider to get a listing, and then triggering the download of each NAR.\r\n- It makes sense to support multiple Nar Providers, even multiple of the same type. It's very reasonable to imagine an organization in which there are multiple teams hosting nars in different locations, and a user may want to fetch from multiple directories, etc. This would all work nicely with the above property naming scheme.\r\n- We should always include debug-level logging indicating which NAR's were returned when performing the listing, and this should indicate how long it took to perform that listing.\r\n- Should log at an INFO level each time a NAR is downloaded and how long that took\r\n- NAR's should be written with a dot-name (`.my-bundle.nar`) and then renamed so that the Extension Loader is able to detect it only when it's done. It probably would make sense to download into a sub-directory of the `extensions` directory. I.e., if the nar loader is configured to monitor the `./extensions` directory we could create a directory `./extensions/hdfs` and then update the Nar Loader to also scan that directory. This would make it easier to understand where each of the NAR's came from if we have multiple NarProviders.\r\n- It's possible that over time users will continually add new versions of a NAR to the same directory. And over time this will result in loading massive amounts of NAR's into NiFi. Those that get removed will remain in NiFi. We will need some way to age off old NARs. Perhaps after performing a listing, we should detect any nar's that were previously downloaded from that NarProvider and not present in the Listing. Then, if any of those is not in use (i.e., no extensions are in the flow that use that bundle) then we can remove the bundle and its NarLoader.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/838659499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/838734495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5064#issuecomment-838734495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5064","id":838734495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzODczNDQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"gschaer","id":5520570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjA1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5520570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer","html_url":"https://github.com/gschaer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gschaer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-11T15:56:54Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T15:56:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> How difficult would it be to have 3 levels of grid display: off, major gridlines only, major and minor?\r\n\r\nGood point.

Configured ExecuteScript with the following script:\r\n```\r\nflowfile = session.get()\r\nflowfile = session.putAttribute(flowfile, 'greeting', 'hello')\r\nsession.transfer(flowfile, REL_SUCCESS)\r\nsession.commit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appeared to run correctly.

Small changes to just make it easier to understand.\r\n> \r\n> There's also the potential for a NullPointerException that must be addressed before we can merge this.\r\n> \r\n> However, the stated goal of NIFI-8126 is to include a new metric about average queue duration, etc. in the stats history. This does not accomplish that. It updates the ConnectionStatus, but it doesn't give us anything in the UI to select the Average Queue Duration. The ConnectionStatusDescriptor needs to be updated to expose that information.\r\n\r\nI will make the requested changes. The ticket actually says to expose a total or an average. I went with the total, leaving it up to consuming systems to calculate the average. This matches other metrics available within ConnectionStatus such as inputBytes, queuedBytes, etc. I will look at adding that to the ConnectionStatusDescriptor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/839779931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/839940334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5059#issuecomment-839940334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5059","id":839940334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzOTk0MDMzNA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-12T16:57:07Z","updated_at":"2021-05-12T16:57:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ottobackwards not sure VFS would provide what we need here.

Just a general observation: it doesn't really make sense IMO to allow for the extensions in nifi to live in either local filesystem or HDFS. What does make sense is local filesystem or some other pluggable location. HDFS will be the only additional location at the point this PR is merged in but it makes sense that it should lay the groundwork for it to be pluggable is all that I was trying to convey.\r\n\r\nThanks @simonbence will take a look.
