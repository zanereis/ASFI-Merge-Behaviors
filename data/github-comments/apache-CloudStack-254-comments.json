@rafaelweingartner \r\nBasically, I started from this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2320/files#diff-71901db20e3d4adb6711e69c1c1ca2ba\r\n\r\nit was found by @rhtyd and I fixed Id from 1 to actual code. I don't include it into PR because master already includes it. Next I went to debugging and opened the issue (CLOUDSTACK-10140) you saw in Jira.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@cs2-secstorage-nfs1:/secondary/template/tmpl/2/209# cat template.properties \r\nuniquename=209-2-3accb15b-8647-356b-9791-9e2f1ec36b6b\r\nfilename=bbab2601-050d-4c18-ae35-00f2ba44de28.qcow2\r\nsize=3254517760\r\nqcow2.filename=bbab2601-050d-4c18-ae35-00f2ba44de28.qcow2\r\nqcow2.virtualsize=10737418240\r\npublic=true\r\nid=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nID is fixed by code from 1st diff, but other information is incorrect including size (I don't see it in my snippet but AFAIK \"size\" field was incorrect and included something like UUID-like with \"-\").\r\n\r\nNext, https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=weizhou user provided the patch and everything started to work fine. Might be the problem in buffered IO which leads to corrupted data? Closing of try leads to sync and processor is able to append correctly?\r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, I didn't dive into details and it's a shame but It takes a lot of time to move across all the ACS code, because I'm not a \"real\" java developer. But this patch really works. I patched the 4.10, compiled, deployed into Agent, recreated SSVM and templates started to work properly. Basically, I recommend to consult Wei Zhou about his patch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/345295039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/345309388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2322#issuecomment-345309388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2322","id":345309388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTMwOTM4OA==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-17T17:28:57Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T17:28:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the information.\r\nCan you also explain something else?
