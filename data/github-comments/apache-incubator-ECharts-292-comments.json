@plainheart it looks a good solution, however I just want to flag something related to the callback you suggested.\r\n\r\nWhenever you use the formatter callback within the `MarkPoint` label object the callback params contain an object with keys like `{ value: 120 }` but the same formatter callback inside the `axisLabel` (e.g. in yAxis) returns the value straight away therefore params has a different type, maybe could be worth to have consistency within this function.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/638243376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/638276864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/9463#issuecomment-638276864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/9463","id":638276864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODI3Njg2NA==","user":{"login":"aloneWang","id":30726187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzI2MTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30726187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang","html_url":"https://github.com/aloneWang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloneWang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T15:36:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T15:36:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"这就关掉？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/638276864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/638536015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12751#issuecomment-638536015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12751","id":638536015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODUzNjAxNQ==","user":{"login":"plainheart","id":26999792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTk5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26999792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart","html_url":"https://github.com/plainheart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plainheart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-04T00:54:29Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T00:54:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It

@plainheart, it's exactly what I was pointing out. \r\n\r\n@Ovilia given multiple objects around the chart are using the same naming convention (`label.formatter`) I would suggest to keep the type of returned values within callbacks the same to keep consistency and permit the developer user to share functions across all the objects (e.g. Markpoint, axisLabel). \r\n\r\ne.g. \r\n```\r\nformatter: () => { \r\n  // always returns either an Object { value: } or a String/Number \r\n}\r\n```\r\nI would  suggest to return an object so you can use keys for the MarkPoint like `name` like this:\r\n```\r\nformatter: params => {\r\n  return `${params.name}\\n${params.value?.toFixed(2)}`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the callback solution mentioned by @plainheart solves my request, I just kept the issue open as I believe it would be an \"enhancement\" the
