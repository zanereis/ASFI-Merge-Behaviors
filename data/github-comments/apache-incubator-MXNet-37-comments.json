you very much for your swift response @thirdwing  . I do feel like I'm getting further with your help now, but I'm not quite there yet. I think I'm lacking some basic knowledge of installing packages this way. I have described in detail what I have done so far, and note that some of the information may be completely redundant but I am unsure as to what I am doing wrong.\n\n**Create `R-package/inst/libs/x64` folder - SUCCESS**\n(1) I have done what you said and created a folder called `R-package/inst/libs/x64`   (in some arbitrary location I assumed)\n\n**Copy .dll files into `R-package/inst/libs/x64`**\n(2) I have copied a bunch of .dll files into the `R-package/inst/libs/x64` folder. I'm unsure whether I have chosen the correct ones. \n  Compared to the [mxnet_0.5.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/drat/gh-pages/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/mxnet_0.5.zip) file, and the folder MXNET/libs/x64:\n- I have the same .dll files. (Noted that the libmxnet.dll I copied is twice the size of the pre-built package file, because it is now the GPU version I'm guessing.)\n- I have also copied 4 extra .dll files from the cudart and cudnn folders, namely,\n  - cublas64_75.dll\n  - cudart64_75.dll\n  - cudnn64_4.dll\n  - curand64_75.dll\n\nI simply assumed I needed those .dll files as well, I hope I'm right about that.\n\n**Create/build `R-package/inst/include` folder**\n(3) I have created the `R-package/inst/include` folder and the folders in `mxnet/nocudnn/include`. Remember, I used the files from here https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/releases/download/weekly_binary_build/20151209_win64_gpu.7z\n\nSo now, `R-package/inst/include` contains 3 subfolders, namely:\n- dmlc\n- mshadow (unsure about whether I need this one)\n- mxnet\n\n**Attempt to use R CMD INSTALL**\nIf I run `R CMD INSTALL R-package` at this point, I get `Warning: invalid package 'R-package`.\n\nI figured, I first need to run `R CMD build --no-build-vignettes R-package`, as in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/Makefile#L199\n(Unsure about the `--no-build-vignettes` part though, I'm unsure of what it does and also tried the command without that argument.)\n\nIf I do try to run `R CMD build --no-build-vignettes R-package` now I get the Error that there is no DESCRIPTION file. Specifically I get:\n- checking for file 'R-package/DESCRIPTION' ... NO\n\n**The ways I tried to fix it**\nSo, naturally I copied the DESCRIPTION, INDEX, LICENSE etc. files from [mxnet_0.5.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/drat/gh-pages/bin/windows/contrib/3.2/mxnet_0.5.zip) into `R-package/` and tried running the command again.\n\nNow, it does seem like if I re-run `R CMD build --no-build-vignettes R-package` that this made some progress. This is the output:\n    \\* checking for file 'R-package/DESCRIPTION' ... OK\n    \\* preparing 'mxnet':\n    \\* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK\n    ERROR\n   computing Rd index failed\n\nThe R warnings it returned were: `Warning in file(con, \"r\"): cannot open file 'man'`\nI wouldn't know where I should've added a file called 'man', so I am lost here.\n\nI feel like I missed something trivial and much of the information I gave above may be redundant.\n\n**EDIT: Some extra output info**\n\nI tried running `R CMD INSTALL R-package` without the whole `R CMD build` step. After I added the DESCRIPTION, INDEX, LICENSE etc. files like I described above, I get the following output:\n- installing to library 'D:/Program files/R-3.1.2/li\n- installing _binary_ package 'mxnet' ...\n  cp: unknown option -- )\n  Try `/usr/bin/cp --help' for more information.\n  Warning: running command 'cp -R . \"D:/Program files/R-3.1.2/library/mxnet\" || (tar cd - .| (cd \"D:/Program files/R-3.1.2/library/mxnet && tar -xf -))' had status 1\n  ERROR: installing binary package failed\n- removing 'D:/Program files/R-3.1.2/library/mxnet'\n\nThis does not help me personally, but it might be a known error to someone else.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167586798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167614753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1093#issuecomment-167614753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1093","id":167614753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzYxNDc1Mw==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-28T17:59:14Z","updated_at":"2015-12-28T17:59:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The shape here should be consistent with what `provide_data` and `provide_label` return.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167614753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167615680","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1088#issuecomment-167615680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1088","id":167615680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzYxNTY4MA==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-28T18:03:08Z","updated_at":"2015-12-28T18:03:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think HDF5 data iter support should be useful.

the resnet-small example, there are differences to the paper:\n- 1*1 convolution operators are used for increasing dimensions.\n-  This is a small residual net consists of 52 layers.\n- Data augmentations are using mxnet default options include center crop (instead of random crop) and random mirror, **no** paddings on raw image data and the input image size is 28×28(instead of 32×32).\n- Hyper parameters, this code is using initial lr=0.01, wd=0.00001. \n\nRunning this example by\n`python train_cifar10.py --network=resnet-small --lr=0.01 --lr-factor=0.1 --lr-factor-epoch=20

what I did before was the wrong way to do it. **My post above can be disregarded** but may be helpful for others that don't have a clue of what they're doing with the installation :')\n\nSo I've started over again.\n\nThis time I realised I first have to get everything from https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet , in which the R-package folder exists.\n\n### Following instructions from @thirdwing\n\n(1) I created the folder 'R-package/inst/libs/x64'\n\n(2) In this folder, I copied all .dll files I think I need from [20151228_win64_gpu.7z](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/releases/download/20151228/20151228_win64_gpu.7z)\n\nTo be precise, from the file I linked I copied all .dll files from:\n- nocudnn/3rdparty/cudart\n- nocudnn/3rdparty/cudnn/bin (cudnn64_70.dll)\n- nocudnn/3rdparty/openblas/bin\n- nocudnn/3rdparty/vc\n- nocudnn/3rdparty/lib\n\n(3) \"create the folder R-package/inst/include and copy all header files into it. Just like what we do in https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/Makefile#L190-L192\"\n\nI did what you said here- and I end up with 3 subfolders in `R-package/inst/nclude/`, namely `/dmlc`, `/mshadow` and `mxnet`.\n\n(4) Now I run, `R CMD INSTALL R-package`\n\n### Result from installing\n\n(Note that I realised I at least had to update R since my last post)\nWhen I run `R CMD INSTALL R-package`, I get this output:\n\n`* installing to library 'D:/Program files/R-3.2.3/library/mxnet'`\n`* installing *source* package 'mxnet' ...`\n`**libs`\n\n`*** arch -i386`\n`make: Nothing to be done for`all'.`\n`installing to D:/Program files/R-3.2.3/library/mxnet/libs/i386`\n\n`*** arch -x64`\n`make: Nothing to be done for 'all'.`\n`installing to D:/Program files/R-3.2.3/library/mxnet/libs/x64`\n\n`** R`\n`** demo`\n`** inst`\n`** preparing package for lazy loading`\n`** help`\n`*** installing help indices`\n`** building package indices`\n`** installing vignettes`\n`** testing if installed package can be loaded`\n`*** arch - i386`\n`Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'mxnet', details:`\n`call: library.dynam(\"libmxnet\", pkgname, libname, local = FALSE)`\n`error: DLL 'libmxnet' not found: maybe not installed for this architecture?`\n`Error: loading failed`\n`Execution halted`\n\n`*** arch - x64`\n`Error: loading failed for 'i386'`\n`* removing 'D:/Program files/R-3.2.3/library/mxnet'`\n\n### What I tried to do to fix it\n\nSo I googled a bit based on the error I got:\n`Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'mxnet', details:`\n`call: library.dynam(\"libmxnet\", pkgname, libname, local = FALSE)`\n`error: DLL 'libmxnet' not found: maybe not installed for this architecture?`\n\nAnd I checked if I already had an installation of mxnet , which I don't. (I uninstalled the CPU-version)\nAnd, I checked if the `libmxnet.dll` file was present in `R-package/inst/libs/x64', and it is.\n\nAlso, I am wondering why it tries to do anything with 'i386' in the first place..\n\nI hope somebody can help me solve the last few steps, because I do think I am close to getting it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167767105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/167770942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1084#issuecomment-167770942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1084","id":167770942,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Nzc3MDk0Mg==","user":{"login":"winstywang","id":4225664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjU2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4225664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang","html_url":"https://github.com/winstywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T11:40:55Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T11:40:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

, i update the example by:\n1. fix the cut_off_size bug of data.py\n2. change ElementWiseSum to directly \"+\" symbol.\n3. add the h_w parameter for Crop Operator, and this can be used for general cropping operator.\n4. fix/add some descriptions.\n5. update the new symbol in [yun.baidu](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1bgz4PC) for use.\n\nps, thought i add the h_w for explicitly set the height and width for crop, but i also retain the use of \"crop_like\" symbol for height and width when corpping. the reason is that even if we crop the input data with the same size, we should also need to manually calculator the crop h_w in some other place, just like in fcn16s and fcn8s , https://github.com/tornadomeet/mxnet/blob/b8b9700fcdb1d7fb4c79a3d271da178639453b8a/example/fcn-xs/symbol_fcnxs.py#L179 and

hyper-parameter of cnn structure is changed, like the stride, pad... then we should manually calculator the size again, so the crop_like symbol is used for auto calculate the crop_size without

Other than that thanks for the great work!\n\nI'd like to think that having them in C++ would improve code reuse, as binding languages wouldn't have to reimplement the optimizers again and again, just provide access to the C++ implementation. This could also improve performance (Try MNIST with 'sgd' and 'ccsgd').\nThe downside I see for having all optimizers in C++, would be that these would be harder to write, debug and maintain. (see https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/src/optimizer/sgd-inl.h vs https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/optimizer.py#L129).\n\nAlso, if anyone is interested in a C++ implementation of RMSProp 'ccrmsprop'.
