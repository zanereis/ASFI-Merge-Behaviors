My colleague and I can contribute but I don't know how skilled we are to be able to contribute effectively, I'm afraid that we don't have enough experience.\r\n\r\nThese days I'm trying to understand how this type of problem can be solved and maybe I'll keep this issue updated.\r\n\r\nLuca","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2371254755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2371285885","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1781#issuecomment-2371285885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1781","id":2371285885,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86NVvN9","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-24T13:30:59Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T13:30:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well ... we recently added a Listener interface to the PlcConnection ...

This error might appear due to differences in client/server protocol implementation. One of causes for such errors was length of cryptographic nonce  used during handshake.\r\nI asked about demo server, simply to run it on my windows machine and try to communicate with it and see if that's the case or is it maybe config error. The NONE security mode usually cuts off most of issues, but be aware that with security mode none you can not use username/password auth. Leave these values empty and try with anonymous auth instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2396753120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2396768395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1802#issuecomment-2396768395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1802","id":2396768395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86O28iL","user":{"login":"codekundan","id":99414530,"node_id":"U_kgDOBezyAg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99414530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan","html_url":"https://github.com/codekundan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-07T12:17:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-07T12:17:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"By Default, it uses **\"Security Policy : Basic128Rsa15\"** and **\"Message Security Mode : Sign & Encrypt\"**.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2396768395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/2396886309","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/1802#issuecomment-2396886309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1802","id":2396886309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa86O3ZUl","user":{"login":"codekundan","id":99414530,"node_id":"U_kgDOBezyAg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99414530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan","html_url":"https://github.com/codekundan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codekundan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-07T13:08:57Z","updated_at":"2024-10-07T13:08:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@splatch I have sent the MXOPC UA Server in your luke@code-house.org mail.
