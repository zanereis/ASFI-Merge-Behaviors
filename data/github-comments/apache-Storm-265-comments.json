As I mentioned in a previous comment:\r\n\r\n> This would be much more useful if it were implemented using a newer version of the msgpack-core library—they changed the name after 0.6.12—because 0.7 and above supports the `BINARY` format, which lets you send arbitrary bytes. Without that, you won't be able to send tuples containing arbitrary bytes with this serializer. This is also a problem with the JSON serializer (because JSON strings can't contain non-Unicode characters), but it would be great if we didn't have the problem here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270457144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270457236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1793#issuecomment-270457236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1793","id":270457236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQ1NzIzNg==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T19:05:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T19:05:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

As Taylor stated, give same seconds to supervisor waiting time and worker waiting time doesn't make sense. Supervisor should wait longer. If not there's no reason for worker to kill itself.</p>\n\n<p>2. For normal topology, after adjusting seconds I got error code 143 (128 + 15), which seems to be expected.<br/>\n<= CORRECTION: It should be 20. I was modifying the code around this, and hook for waiting and shutdown seemed to have a bug.</p>\n\n<p>3. If worker has one or more multi-lang tasks, for now they are having high chance to raise NoOutputException in progress of shutting down (yes we should fix that, but not considered as critical for me), and when it calls System.exit() to give up, worker is going into deadlock since shutdown hook is already running.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/know-jvm-series-2-shutdown\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://dzone.com/articles/know-jvm-series-2-shutdown</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>5. Once shutdown sequence starts, it can be stopped by Runtime.halt() only.</p>\n\n<p>Once the shutdown sequence starts, only Runtime.halt() (which forcefully terminates the JVM) can stop the execution of the shutdown sequence (except for external influences such as SIGKILL). This means that calling System.exit() with in a Shutdown Hook will not work. Actually, if you call System.exit() with in a Shutdown Hook, the VM will get stuck, and you have to terminate the process forcefully.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>4.

above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270936667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/270938933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1785#issuecomment-270938933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1785","id":270938933,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDkzODkzMw==","user":{"login":"ppoulosk","id":4550393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTAzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4550393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk","html_url":"https://github.com/ppoulosk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppoulosk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T16:15:34Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T16:15:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@abellina

\r\n\r\n>1- Retry worthy Errors\r\n\r\nRight now theres no explicit `fail` api. When a stage in the stream completes processing (and possibly emits results), the underlying tuples are acked automatically. The only way spout will re-emit is after the message timeout. It may be good to have a fail fast api, but I am not sure how it would help since the replayed tuple could fail again in processing. Instead the processing logic itself can have some retry logic (say retry 3 times) and forward to an error stream  and ack the tuple.\r\n\r\n> 2- Not worth retrying\r\n\r\nThis can be handled via branch logic. E.g. send valid values to stream1 and bad values to stream2.\r\n\r\nI have opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2282 to discuss ideas around this and see what apis can be added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/271788314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/271789333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1693#issuecomment-271789333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1693","id":271789333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTc4OTMzMw==","user":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T06:28:39Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T06:28:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR have addressed the comments and fixed the issue with state handling.
