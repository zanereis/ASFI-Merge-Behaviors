This isn't problematic in itself but it's an issue when the `ROW` or `ARRAY` contains a `MAP` object, i.e, `array(map(varchar, varchar))`. \r\n\r\nThe failure is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"error\": \"list index out of range\", \"stacktrace\": \"Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \\\"/srv/superset/superset/views/core.py\\\", line 2284, in table\\n    columns = mydb.get_columns(table_name, schema)\\n  File \\\"/srv/superset/superset/models/core.py\\\", line 1154, in get_columns\\n    return self.db_engine_spec.get_columns(self.inspector, table_name, schema)\\n  File \\\"/srv/superset/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py\\\", line 235, in get_columns\\n    cls._parse_structural_column(column.Column, column.Type, result)\\n  File \\\"/srv/superset/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py\\\", line 157, in _parse_structural_column\\n    if field_info[1] == \\\"array\\\" or field_info[1] == \\\"row\\\":\\nIndexError: list index out of range\\n\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI looked into trying to fix (checking the length of `field_info`) but I don't fully follow the logic and I'm unsure whether a `MAP` needs to be handled like an `ARRAY` or `ROW` and thus where I should fix this.
