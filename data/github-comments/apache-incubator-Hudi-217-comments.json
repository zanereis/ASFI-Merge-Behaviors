for flagging this @YuweiXiao, great catch! \r\n\r\nTo summarize what the issue is here: it is unfortunately a very sneaky one and it occurred accidentally during the refactoring of AvroSerializer/Deserializer hierarchy in Hudi.\r\n\r\nCrux of the issue is that converter initializes AvroSerializer/Deserializer upon _every_ invocation of it, b/c it's done w/in the returned lambda itself (it also has a side-effect of pulling whole `SparkAdapter` into the closure):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef createAvroToInternalRowConverter(rootAvroType: Schema, rootCatalystType: StructType): GenericRecord => Option[InternalRow] =\r\n    record => sparkAdapter.createAvroDeserializer(rootAvroType, rootCatalystType)\r\n      .deserialize(record)\r\n      .map(_.asInstanceOf[InternalRow])\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead it should have been\r\n```\r\ndef createAvroToInternalRowConverter(rootAvroType: Schema, rootCatalystType: StructType): GenericRecord => Option[InternalRow] = { \r\n  val deserilizer = sparkAdapter.createAvroDeserializer(rootAvroType, rootCatalystType) \r\n  record => \r\n
