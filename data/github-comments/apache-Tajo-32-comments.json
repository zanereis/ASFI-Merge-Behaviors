I found that the result of `S3Tablespace::calculateSize` is always equals to the result of `FileSystem::getContentsSummary`.

It seems that the cause of performance difference is listing directories recursively.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/221473568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222065279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/1031#issuecomment-222065279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/1031","id":222065279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjA2NTI3OQ==","user":{"login":"jinossy","id":3632397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzIzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3632397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy","html_url":"https://github.com/jinossy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T05:45:44Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T05:45:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222065279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222081661","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/1027#issuecomment-222081661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/1027","id":222081661,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjA4MTY2MQ==","user":{"login":"eminency","id":3282561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODI1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3282561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency","html_url":"https://github.com/eminency","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eminency/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T07:43:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T07:43:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Separated issues and refined code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222081661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222400539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/1024#issuecomment-222400539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/1024","id":222400539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjQwMDUzOQ==","user":{"login":"jinossy","id":3632397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzIzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3632397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy","html_url":"https://github.com/jinossy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-30T02:34:04Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T02:34:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Guys, \n\nI found the improved performance reason. If there is not set the delimiter, the listObjects return a list of summary information about the objects. it reduce the requests to aws.\n\nplease see the below comments\n\n```\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/model/ListObjectsRequest.html\n\nContains options to return a list of summary information about the objects in the specified bucket. Depending on the request parameters, additional information is returned, such as common prefixes if a delimiter was specified. List results are always returned in lexicographic (alphabetical) order.\n\nBuckets can contain a virtually unlimited number of keys, and the complete results of a list query can be extremely large. To manage large result sets, Amazon S3 uses pagination to split them into multiple responses. Always check the ObjectListing.isTruncated() method to see if the returned listing is complete, or if callers need to make additional calls to get more results. Alternatively, use the AmazonS3Client.listNextBatchOfObjects(ObjectListing) method as an easy way to get the next page of object listings.\n\nCalling setDelimiter(String) sets the delimiter, allowing groups of keys that share the delimiter-terminated prefix to be included in the returned listing. This allows applications to organize and browse their keys hierarchically, similar to how a file system organizes files into directories. These common prefixes can be retrieved through the ObjectListing.getCommonPrefixes() method.\n\nFor example, consider a bucket that contains the following keys:\n\n\"foo/bar/baz\"\n\"foo/bar/bash\"\n\"foo/bar/bang\"\n\"foo/boo\"\nIf calling listObjects with a prefix value of \"foo/\" and a delimiter value of \"/\" on this bucket, an ObjectListing is returned that contains one key (\"foo/boo\") and one entry in the common prefixes list (\"foo/bar/\"). To see deeper into the virtual hierarchy, make another call to listObjects setting the prefix parameter to any interesting common prefix to list the individual keys under that prefix.\nThe total number of keys in a bucket doesn't substantially affect list performance, nor does the presence or absence of additional request parameters.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222400539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/222400768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/1024#issuecomment-222400768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/1024","id":222400768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjQwMDc2OA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-30T02:36:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T02:36:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for sharing.
