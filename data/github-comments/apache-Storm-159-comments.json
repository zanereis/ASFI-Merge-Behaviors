Or at least not crash constantly when it does happen and yell a lot in the logs.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612631250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612631254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5037#issuecomment-2612631254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5037","id":2612631254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MzEyNTQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T22:49:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:14:11Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user roshannaik commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/936#discussion_r49248342\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/936#discussion_r49248342</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: external/storm-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/hdfs/spout/FileLock.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,328 @@<br/>\n    +/**<br/>\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one<br/>\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.

Not only the SQL interface allows faster development cycles on streaming analytics, but also opens up the opportunities to unify batch data processing like <span class=\"error\">&#91;Apache Hive&#93;</span>(///hive.apache.org) and real-time streaming data analytics.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +At a very high level StormSQL compiles the SQL queries to <span class=\"error\">&#91;Trident&#93;</span>(Trident-API-Overview.html) topologies and executes them in Storm clusters. This document provides information of how to use StormSQL as end users.

Users can specify data sources using the `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement. The syntax of `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` closely follows the one defined in <span class=\"error\">&#91;Hive Data Definition Language&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL):\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL):</a><br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE table_name field_list<br/>\n    +    [ STORED AS<br/>\n    +      INPUTFORMAT input_format_classname<br/>\n    +      OUTPUTFORMAT output_format_classname<br/>\n    +    ]<br/>\n    +    LOCATION location<br/>\n    +    [ TBLPROPERTIES tbl_properties ]<br/>\n    +    [ AS select_stmt ]<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +You can find detailed explanations of the properties in <span class=\"error\">&#91;Hive Data Definition Language&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL</a>). For example, the following statement specifies a Kafka spouts and sink:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE FOO (ID INT PRIMARY KEY) LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=test' TBLPROPERTIES '{\"producer\":{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\",\"acks\":\"1\",\"key.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.IntSerializer\",\"value.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.ByteBufferSerializer\"}}'<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Plugging in External Data Sources<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Users plug in external data sources through implementing the `ISqlTridentDataSource` interface and registers them using the mechanisms of Java's service loader. The external data source will be chosen based on the scheme of the URI of the tables. Please refer to the implementation of `storm-sql-kafka` for more details.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Example: Filtering Kafka Stream<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Let's say there is a Kafka stream that represents the transactions of orders. Each message in the stream contains the id of the order, the unit price of the product and the quantity of the orders. The goal is to filter orders where the transactions are significant and to insert these orders into another Kafka stream for further analysis.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The user can specify the following SQL statements in the SQL file:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ORDERS (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, UNIT_PRICE INT, QUANTITY INT) LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=orders' TBLPROPERTIES '{\"producer\":{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\",\"acks\":\"1\",\"key.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.IntSerializer\",\"value.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.ByteBufferSerializer\"}}'<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE LARGE_ORDERS (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, TOTAL INT) LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=large_orders' TBLPROPERTIES '{\"producer\":{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\",\"acks\":\"1\",\"key.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.IntSerializer\",\"value.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.ByteBufferSerializer\"}}'<br/>\n    +INSERT INTO LARGE_ORDERS SELECT ID, UNIT_PRICE * QUANTITY AS TOTAL FROM ORDERS WHERE UNIT_PRICE * QUANTITY > 50<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The first statement defines the table `ORDER` which represents the input stream. The `LOCATION` clause specifies the ZkHost (`localhost:2181`), the path of the brokers in ZooKeeper (`/brokers`) and the topic (`orders`). The `TBLPROPERTIES` clause specifies the configuration of <span class=\"error\">&#91;KafkaProducer&#93;</span>(<a href=\"http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs</a>).<br/>\n    +Current implementation of `storm-sql-kafka` requires specifying both `LOCATION` and `TBLPROPERTIES` clauses even though the table is read-only or write-only.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Similarly, the second statement specifies the table `LARGE_ORDERS` which represents the output stream. The third statement is a `SELECT` statement which defines the topology: it instructs StormSQL to filter all orders in the external table `ORDERS`, calculates the total price and inserts matching records into the Kafka stream specified by `LARGE_ORDER`.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +To run this example, users need to include the data sources (`storm-sql-kafka` in this case) and its dependency in the class path. One approach is to put the required jars into the `extlib` directory:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +$ cp curator-client-2.5.0.jar curator-framework-2.5.0.jar zookeeper-3.4.6.jar<br/>\n    + extlib/<br/>\n    +$ cp scala-library-2.10.4.jar kafka-clients-0.8.2.1.jar kafka_2.10-0.8.2.1.jar metrics-core-2.2.0.jar extlib/<br/>\n    +$ cp json-simple-1.1.1.jar extlib/<br/>\n    +$ cp storm-kafka-<b>.jar storm-sql-kafka-</b>.jar storm-sql-runtime-*.jar extlib/<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    cp jackson-annotations-2.6.0.jar extlib</p>\n\n<p>    To run the kafka example I needed to add jackson-annotations-2.6.0.jar to extlib</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612683694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/170201430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1001#issuecomment-170201430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1001","id":170201430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDIwMTQzMA==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-09T06:26:20Z","updated_at":"2016-01-09T06:26:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this

It says you have a working prototype for windowing.  Could you post something describing the changes you had to make to the coordinators or how the coordination works to support the windowing operations.<br/>\n<Satish> There are no changes done at batch coordinators for this feature as the chosen approach is at operator/bolt level. Batches are replayed by coordinators when there are any failures and window operator’s bolt will receive the failed batches. I have basic prototype but it does not cover all the details mentioned here. I can start working on this design and raise PR soon if the chosen approach seems to be in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Also an explanation of how the windowed state will be stored would be very good. I would like to see both the format and how the bolts communicate the state to the state store.<br/>\n<Satish> Window processor is an implementation of TridentProcessor. It contains state-store(its factory is passed with window operations by user) and window-manager instances. It takes tuples and accumulates in-memory collection. When a batch is finished, it is added to the window state store and window-manager. Window manager determines when to trigger or evict based on the windowing configuration.</p>\n\n<p>window-manager:<br/>\nIt contains a List of tuples containing only batch_id, tuple_index, and timestamp value but the actual tuple field values are stored in window state store. Window manager fires triggers/evictors based on the window configuration. When a trigger is fired it accumulates and keeps the triggered tuples in store. But the plan is to compute the aggregated value of those triggered tuples, add it to the store and update the expired tuples of respective batches from the store.</p>\n\n<p>window state store:<br/>\nCurrent representation of tuples : Map of <component_id | task_id | batch_id> vs <List of trident tuples><br/>\nIt may be changed to: Map of <component_id | task_id | batch_id | tuple_index> vs <TridentTuple></p>\n\n<p>Currently created MapStore with API of<br/>\npublic static interface MapStore<K, V> {<br/>\n    public V get(K k);<br/>\n    public Collection<V> getWithPrefixKey(K k);<br/>\n    public void put(K k, V v);<br/>\n    public boolean remove(K k);<br/>\n}<br/>\nBut storm.trident.state.map.MapState can be used/enhanced for the same. For better performance, may need to add range based APIs for get and put.</p>\n\n<p>trigger-state representation:<br/>\nCurrently, Map of <component_id | task_id | ‘$trigger’|trigger_id> vs Collection of TridentTuples, trigger_id is sequence of integer value.<br/>\nValue of the above Map can be backtype.storm.tuple.Values instance as aggregation can be done when a trigger is fired.</p>\n\n<p>When finishBatch is invoked on WindowProcessor then it checks whether there are any pending triggers to be emitted. These triggered results are emitted to collector as part of the current batch.</p>\n\n<p>Will there be any aggregation before writing the state?<br/>\n<Satish> Currently, triggers are not storing the aggregated values. But the plan is to compute the aggregation and store that.</p>\n\n<p>How will you handle a topology coming down and a new one with a different parallelism of bolts/spouts coming back up?  I would suspect that it should not be a problem as we can aggregate over the old parallelism + the new parallelism, but I want to be sure we take that into account.<br/>\n<Satish> Right. Whenever a bolt is prepared, it gets the current state of that bolt containing componentId/taskId from window state store and creates window-manager which comprises windowing data for earlier unfinished tuples and pending triggers.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612526529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612526535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4517#issuecomment-2612526535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4517","id":2612526535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1MjY1MzU=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-11T14:26:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:25:25Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=satish.duggana\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"satish.duggana\">Satish Duggana</a>,</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the explanation it looks like you have thought through this fairly well.

I purposely moved rotating the metrics off of the critical path.  The call to rotate happens in a background thread, that is shared by all similar metrics in a worker process.  This allows the critical path, the thing that happens all of the time, to be just an atomic increment.  Rotating only happens every 30 seconds or so too.  So I suspect the best that it is going to do is reduce the overall CPU the worker uses by a tiny amount.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612613813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612613821","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4966#issuecomment-2612613821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4966","id":2612613821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2MTM4MjE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-11T14:50:56Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:06:38Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>Github user abhishekagarwal87 commented on a diff in the pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/816#discussion_r49328566\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/816#discussion_r49328566</a></p>\n\n<p>    &#8212; Diff: storm-core/src/jvm/backtype/storm/metric/internal/CountStatAndMetric.java &#8212;<br/>\n    @@ -0,0 +1,211 @@<br/>\n    +/**<br/>\n    + * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one<br/>\n    + * or more contributor license agreements.
