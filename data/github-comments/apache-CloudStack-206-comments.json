It further imposes or knows any limitation associated with the resource being HA-ed. With this PR, we've presented two Host-HA plugins (a) a HA provider simulator to verify the framework in a _deterministic_ way that's not possible with the status quo, and (b) a HA provider for KVM that uses out-of-band management. This approach clearly and cleanly provides a good policy vs implementation outlook for the developer and for writing good robust tests, than the status quo. We're further also implemented an out-of-band management nested-cloudstack plugin to allow us to test this feature at scale with virtualized KVM-hosts (VMs) with Trillian and other environments.\r\n\r\nFor current VM-HA VMs are first class resource/objects, while for Host-HA at the framework level the first class resource/objects are agnostic but the implementation is not and is as per host/hypervisor specific plugins (that are free to implement recovery, fencing and other operations). In the KVM specific HA provider we've implemented, it uses oobm based fencing/recoverd/investigation and hosts are first class resources.\r\n\r\nFor Host-HA to work and execute the recovery and fence operations -- VM HA should not kick-in before host is successfully investigated, recovered, fenced etc. In terms of precedence of execution, Host HA > VM HA i.e. Host-HA operations runs before VM-HA operations. The current VM HA framework does a poor job at reliably fencing a host, at least on KVM based large prod. environments this has shown to cause disk corruptions. Without modifying the current VM HA framework or rewriting it -- this limitation or precedence of execution has been addressed by the KVM HA provider implementation by returning suitable states for VM HA framework to block it from executing before Host-HA completes its operations, but only for suitable hosts i.e where the host-ha provider is configured and enabled and have oobm enable.\r\nNote: for this VM HA _framework_ itself has not been modified, or rewritten in any way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/295167146/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/295168407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1836#issuecomment-295168407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1836","id":295168407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTE2ODQwNw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T08:46:03Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T08:46:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@blueorangutan package","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/295168407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/295168805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1836#issuecomment-295168805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1836","id":295168805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTE2ODgwNQ==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-19T08:47:02Z","updated_at":"2017-04-19T08:47:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rhtyd a Jenkins job has been kicked to build packages.
