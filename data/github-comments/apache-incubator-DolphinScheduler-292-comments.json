@caishunfeng thank u for ur reply, I'm also talking about the original record on workflow instance page. I agree with your design, but it's not actually implemented that way. There are two problems that are completely different from this design. Please check the following screenshot:\r\n_org.apache.dolphinscheduler.service.process.ProcessServiceImpl.constructProcessInstance_\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20518339/187028602-16ac5a89-f65e-42ee-80ee-d878571edfee.png)\r\nWhen the _**MasterSchedulerBootstrap**_ thread gets the command from the db and converts it to the process instance, it will update the process instance to db, including the startTime and endTime fields. So there are two issues.\r\n**Issue 1: The start time of this workflow record will be refreshed every time it is re-run.** It cannot keep the first time as startTime.\r\n**Issue 2: update endTime to null cannot take affect.** because Mybatis plus updateById will skip the null params (FieldStrategy.NOT_NULL is default update strategy). We should set the FieldStrategy to IGNORED for the ProcessInstance.endTime, please review the following change:\r\n`@TableField(updateStrategy = FieldStrategy.IGNORED)\r\n    private Date endTime;`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1229178671/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1229179578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11669#issuecomment-1229179578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11669","id":1229179578,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5JQ8q6","user":{"login":"DarkAssassinator","id":20518339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTE4MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20518339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator","html_url":"https://github.com/DarkAssassinator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkAssassinator/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-27T12:02:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-27T12:02:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In addition, based on this question, I think a judgment should be added, the start time must be guaranteed to be earlier than the end time, otherwise the Duration value should be set to null.

I agree with your design, but it's not actually implemented that way. There are two problems that are completely different from this design. Please check the following screenshot: _org.apache.dolphinscheduler.service.process.ProcessServiceImpl.constructProcessInstance_ ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20518339/187028602-16ac5a89-f65e-42ee-80ee-d878571edfee.png) When the _**MasterSchedulerBootstrap**_ thread gets the command from the db and converts it to the process instance, it will update the process instance to db, including the startTime and endTime fields. So there are two issues. **Issue 1: The start time of this workflow record will be refreshed every time it is re-run.** It cannot keep the first time as startTime. **Issue 2: update endTime to null cannot take affect.** because Mybatis plus updateById will skip the null params (FieldStrategy.NOT_NULL is default update strategy). We should set the FieldStrategy to IGNORED for the ProcessInstance.endTime, please review the following change: `@TableField(updateStrategy = FieldStrategy.IGNORED) private Date endTime;`\r\n\r\n@DarkAssassinator Thanks for your reply. I think `re-run` is different from `recovery failure` or `recovery pause`, it's better to create a new workflow instance with the name such as `workflowName-2`, and then it can keep the old one. \r\nWhat do you think? cc @lenboo @ruanwenjun ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1229361987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1229380158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10211#issuecomment-1229380158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10211","id":1229380158,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5JRto-","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-28T05:28:44Z","updated_at":"2022-08-28T05:28:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Hi @iamliangdi, may I ask whether you have any follow-ups to this issue?

What if hive with kerberos? Most companies will enable kerberos in the production environment.\r\n\r\n@zhuxt2015 Good question. AFAIK, currently DS task plugins do not support `kerberos` except `SQL tasks with datasource`. I've added instructions in docs about how to choose between `hive datasource` and `hive cli task plugin` for different scenarios. If they enable `kerberos`, they could use `SQL tasks with hive datasource` to connect to `hiveserver2` with `jdbc` at this moment.\r\n\r\nHowever, it will be great if other task plugins like `spark task plugin`, `hive cli task plugin`, etc. could support `kerberos` in the future. May I ask whether you have any suggestions or ideas on how to do it? Thanks.
