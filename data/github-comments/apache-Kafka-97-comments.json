thank you for the article, it was fascinating, and it may indeed be that our profiling runs were affected.\n\nto gauge the effect of this change i used the following \"micro-benchmark\" (quoted because i didnt bother with a full JMH one):\n\n``` java\n@Test\ndef perfTest(): Unit = {\n   val batchSize = 1\n   var nanosTotal: Long = 0\n   var runsTotal: Int = 0\n   (1 to 1000000).foreach(i => {\n     val messages = (1 to batchSize).map(m => {\n       new Message((s\"message num $m\" + System.currentTimeMillis()).getBytes)\n     })\n     val messageSet = new ByteBufferMessageSet(GZIPCompressionCodec, messages: _*)\n     var count = 0\n     val start = System.nanoTime()\n     messageSet.foreach((offset: MessageAndOffset) => {\n       count += 1\n     })\n     val elapsed = System.nanoTime() - start\n     assertEquals(batchSize, count)\n     if (i > 100000) { //warm up iterations\n       nanosTotal += elapsed\n       runsTotal += 1\n     }\n   })\n   val avg = nanosTotal / (runsTotal * 1000000.0)\n   println(s\"$avg ms on avg\")\n}\n```\n\ncomparing the avg per-betch iteration time between vanilla Kafka and my patch shows it highly depends on the batch parameters.\n\nThe most extreme case is small batches and fast compression - batch size 1 + snappy show a ~x4 time improvement. this would be typical of environments where kafka would be used for real time messaging (tiny batches, fast compression).\n\nOn the other extreme (batch size 10000 + gzip) there's no noticeable difference.\n\nAlso no difference in case no compression was used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253690417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253690858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1995#issuecomment-253690858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1995","id":253690858,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzY5MDg1OA==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T02:01:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T02:01:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Minor comment on the javadoc, but the rest looks good.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253690858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253699254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1995#issuecomment-253699254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1995","id":253699254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzY5OTI1NA==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T03:14:05Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T03:14:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

I'll continue running the test while I prepare the next release candidate.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253935936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253946570","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2007#issuecomment-253946570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2007","id":253946570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzk0NjU3MA==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T23:57:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T23:57:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good overall. @dguy @enothereska @hjafarpour\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253946570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253973413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1588#issuecomment-253973413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1588","id":253973413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzk3MzQxMw==","user":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T09:36:14Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T09:36:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dguy you can check the passed version of PR `comments reverted to previous version`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/253973413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/254061368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1761#issuecomment-254061368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1761","id":254061368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDA2MTM2OA==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-16T17:39:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T17:39:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah good idea.

I am currently traveling and the network is a little flaky. \n\n@guozhangwang can you elaborate a little on the \"not thread safe\" purgatory? I am not sure what does that exactly mean. In the `DelayedOperationPurgatory`, we have locking on two things: 1) the lock on `operations` list and 2) the lock on each single operation.  \n\nThe first lock seems necessary to ensure the purgatory works correctly. The second lock is more of do a favor for the purgatory users.\n\nUnfortunately, the current deadlock is caused by the first locking instead of the second one. i.e. Thread 1 holds the group lock and try to put a DelayedProduce into the purgatory `operations` list. Meanwhile thread 2 holds the purgatory `operations` list lock and try to lock the group when executing the delayed heartbeat.\n\nSo if the \"not thread safe\" purgatory means we do not perform the lock on each single operation, that seems not really help? Am I misunderstanding something?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/254151815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/254175228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2032#issuecomment-254175228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2032","id":254175228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDE3NTIyOA==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T10:50:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T10:50:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dguy @guozhangwang please have a look.
