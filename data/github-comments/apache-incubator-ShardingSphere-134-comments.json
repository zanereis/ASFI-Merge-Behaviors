have received several similar reports about the slow startup recently, mostly due to loading unconfigured tables for meta data purpose of ShardingSphere.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6179 : 7000+ tables cost much time.\r\nSimilar issues: https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6161 , https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5755 , https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/5999 .\r\n\r\nLoading table (column and index information) is expensive, there're 7 SQLs interactive for each table.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24643893/86317891-24003900-bc63-11ea-9bb9-9d6ffbaa0316.png)\r\n\r\nAfter investigate, I found that for tables unconfigured will not use column or index information any more after loading. So we can omit this process. \r\n\r\nI also checked the relevant issue https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4460 , which will load collation for all columns in every table. If a table is unconfigured, the route result must be single route, a single route will not need merge any more. If the resultset does not need to merge, it is irrelevant with cache of collation. So I think we can safely remove the loading of unconfigured tables now.\r\n\r\nNote that all unconfigured table names still need to be loaded for routing logic, this can simply obtain from one SQL for each database.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/652786884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/652792630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6212#issuecomment-652792630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6212","id":652792630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Mjc5MjYzMA==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-02T05:32:41Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T05:32:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We can accomplish the goal by several steps.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Remove the load procedure for unconfigured tables.\r\n- [ ] Remove the refresh procedure for unconfigured tables\r\n- [ ] Remove the multi-thread logic for unconfigured tables.
