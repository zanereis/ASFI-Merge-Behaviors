Thanks for putting in the grunt work on this.\r\n\r\nWhen using NUnit 2.x, we didn't have any issues running out of space when the output actually went to the output window. That problem began occurring when NUnit 3.x started putting the output in each test, which apparently has a limited amount of space available. Maybe there is a way to increase the space available, but it certainly is a lot more like the intended experience direct the console output somewhere it could be viewed in one chunk of text, as there is information that is output *between* each test run that may otherwise be lost.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/773637723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/773652223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/406#issuecomment-773652223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/406","id":773652223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MzY1MjIyMw==","user":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-04T22:44:22Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T22:44:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Upgrading the two as a pair seemed to make things happy.

Thank you for linking to the public docs which do in fact show the method public in version 5.2.  The odd thing is that when I look up the class in the [Lucene Java 5.x repo](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/branch_5x/lucene/join/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/join/TermsQuery.java#L38) I see that it does not have an access modifier. And when no access modifier is specified in Java the default is [package private](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3530065/what-is-the-default-access-specifier-in-java/3530070#3530070) which means it is not publicly available.  \r\n\r\nIn the latest version of Java Lucene, the `TermsQuery` class still has [no access modifier](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/join/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/join/TermsQuery.java#L37) which means that it's still not publicly available.  \r\n\r\nThis causes me to think the Java documentation is wrong to show it as a public class.  But I would expect the java documentation to be generated from the code base so I'm a bit baffled.  Perhaps someone else can chime in about this.

This class has never been declared public in Lucene.\r\n\r\nIn Lucene 5.1.0, a new public [TermsQuery](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/5.1.0/lucene/queries/src/java/org/apache/lucene/queries/TermsQuery.java) class was added to the `queries` package, which is the one the documentation link refers to above.\r\n\r\nIn principle, I don't see any issue with making the `TermsQuery` class in `Lucene.Net.Join` public. But I would like to ask the Lucene team why it was made package private in the first place. If the Lucene team agrees that it should be made public in the current version, then I don't see any reason we can't make that change in Lucene.NET 4.8.0.

On [this line](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/410/commits/0f1894540dd877b47db4a0b86e3ec93cdf2906f4#diff-10b89dfb9b661aa00c8521f46673d331f50fe6ec82a342af7bd58ca7f8b21defR53), this is a bit twiddle that is equivalent to Java's `>>>` operator (unsigned right shift). The cast was done to make it unsigned, however, there is a faster approach that doesn't require a cast (at least not with `int`) is to use [`TripleShift`](https://github.com/NightOwl888/J2N/blob/b24a28da203b55aba860f16d955ce3b1788fcd42/src/J2N/Numerics/BitOperation.cs#L531-L645).\r\n\r\nI removed more than 1000 casts last night and have passing tests, but I would like to run some benchmarks to see how removing them compares with the casts in place before submitting the PR. Benchmarking the `TripleShift(this int number, int bits)` method against the two casts shows almost a 20% improvement in performance, and during the tests there seems to be less locking contention.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/779731240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/779736300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/410#issuecomment-779736300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/410","id":779736300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTczNjMwMA==","user":{"login":"eladmarg","id":3823205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg","html_url":"https://github.com/eladmarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-16T10:18:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T10:18:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cool, the expensive parts are the casts, if you have this on separate PR, this one can be closed.\r\nwaiting to see it in action","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/779736300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/779815429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/419#issuecomment-779815429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/419","id":779815429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTgxNTQyOQ==","user":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-16T12:48:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T12:48:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll do this one.

But those patches were made to Lucene 4.10 files, and when investigating other patches that just one of the patched files ([hunspell/Dictionary.java](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blame/releases/lucene-solr/4.10.0/lucene/analysis/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/hunspell/Dictionary.java) ) contains, I learned that it contained the following patches that occurred after Lucene 4.8.1:  LUCENE-5485, LUCENE-5603, LUCENE-5777, LUCENE-5778, LUCENE-5823, LUCENE-5826, and LUCENE-5864.   \r\n\r\nThat was almost enough of a deterrent for me right there.

I took a close look at these patches.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that since most analyzers exist in a vacuum, to upgrade hunspell to the latest version of Lucene. However, FST had some major changes in 6.x, so that is not an option.\r\n\r\nBut since there were quite a few hunspell issues patched before 5.x, I am proposing upgrading the whole `Lucene.Net.Hunspell` namespace (and tests) to version [4.10.4](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/releases/lucene-solr%2F4.10.4), the latest 4.x version. This reduces the risk of incompatible changes and gives us a point in time we can debug the code against without too much mental anguish, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\"LUCENE-5778: support hunspell morphological description fields\" isn't a big deal, but \"LUCENE-5864: Split BytesRef into BytesRef and BytesRefBuilder\" is a major API change to the `Lucene.Net.Util` namespace.

It looks like C# is finally catching up with Java in this regard.\r\n\r\nSo, with that revelation my thought is now to change the return type to match Lucene instead of using the (obsolete) .NET convention for the `Clone()` method. We keep the cast, but no longer force the end user to contend with casting when cloning. This is a non-breaking change for most projects.\r\n\r\nThe only question is, do we really need the feature of allowing the end user to custom compile with `ICloneable`? My vote is no, we don't need it anymore. A comment on why we diverged and not implemented `ICloneable` in .NET will suffice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to `Clone()` there are **a lot** of classes where the subclass in Java returns a covariant (subclass) of the base type, which we can now do to eliminate even more casts. That being said, it will be hard to find them. Any thoughts on how we might track these down without doing a method by method comparison of virtual/abstract methods?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/783526882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/783580181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/430#issuecomment-783580181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/430","id":783580181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MzU4MDE4MQ==","user":{"login":"eladmarg","id":3823205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg","html_url":"https://github.com/eladmarg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladmarg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-22T18:30:56Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T18:30:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we don't need the ICloneable, it was only a patch for the .net port\r\nmy main concern is if this truly solves the the performance penalty of boxing / unboxing issues behind the scenes.

In some cases however, it is more safe to use docfx 'override' files. For example, we are already doing this with the [/websites/apidocs/apispec/core/Lucene_Net_Codecs.md file](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/0dbda3e18c7b69bd6beecd8e47d288c00d5d5440/websites/apidocs/apiSpec/core/Lucene_Net_Codecs.md).

In some cases it may make more sense to use override files as opposed to modifying the converted file. I guess there's no strict rules on whether to use override files or not. I dunno, i guess there's pros/cons to both. By changing the converted files it means we'd know about any changes made upstream to them in the Java Lucene project and we'd have to manually merge those, but by using override files we don't end up with merge issues which might be nicer in cases where we totally overhaul the docs.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like override files are probably better for maintenance. But on the other hand, it sounds like it might be confusing for contributors if they think that modifying the original will modify the API site. \r\n\r\nWe should probably do an experiment with each to try to get a feel for which choice is the right one for given scenarios.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/786962763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/787435151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/429#issuecomment-787435151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/429","id":787435151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NzQzNTE1MQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-28T11:11:49Z","updated_at":"2021-02-28T11:17:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI took a look at this and how changing `Lucene.Net.Search.FieldDoc` to be generic would affect other types, and have come up with a possible way we can eliminate boxing/unboxing, but it does require some breaking changes across public APIs.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nFieldDoc // Make FieldDoc<T>\r\nFieldDoc.Fields // Change from object[] to T[]\r\nIndexSearcher.SearchAfter(ScoreDoc after, Query query, int n, Sort sort) // Change ScoreDoc to FieldDoc<T>\r\nIndexSearcher.SearchAfter(ScoreDoc after, Query query, Filter filter, int n, Sort sort) // Change ScoreDoc to FieldDoc<T>\r\nIndexSearcher.SearchAfter(ScoreDoc after, Query query, Filter filter, int n, Sort sort, bool doDocScores, bool doMaxScore) // Change ScoreDoc to FieldDoc<T>\r\nIndexSearcher.Search(Weight weight, FieldDoc after, int nDocs, Sort sort, bool fillFields, bool doDocScores, bool doMaxScore) // Change FieldDoc to FieldDoc<T>\r\nTopFieldCollector.Create(Sort sort, int numHits, FieldDoc after, bool fillFields, bool trackDocScores, bool trackMaxScore, bool docsScoredInOrder) // Change FieldDoc to FieldDoc<T>\r\nTopFieldCollector.PagingFieldCollector // Change to PagingFieldCollerctor<T> (this class is private)\r\nTopFieldCollector.PagingFieldCollector(FieldValueHitQueue<Entry> queue, FieldDoc after, int numHits, bool fillFields, bool trackDocScores, bool trackMaxScore) // ctor: Change FieldDoc to FieldDoc<T>\r\nFieldComparer.SetTopValue(object value) // Change to SetTopValue<TValue>(TValue value)\r\nFieldComparer<T>.SetTopValue(object value) // Change to SetTopValue(T value) and overload SetTopValue<T>(T value). \r\nToParentBlockJoinFieldComparer : FieldComparer<object> // Rely on SetTopValue<T>(T value) rather than SetTopValue(object value)? The class cannot be made generic easily due to its usage in ToParentBlockJoinSortField.GetComparer(int numHits, int sortPos).\r\n```\r\n> NOTE: There are also several subclasses of `FieldComparer<T>` that can remove the casting, especially in cases where it is currently object to numeric type.\r\n\r\n`FieldComparer<T>` was only generic in Lucene, but had to be widened in C# because there is no common type between different closing types in C# (`FieldComparer<long>` is a different type than `FieldComparer<float>` and cannot be put into a strongly typed array together). So, another abstraction was added, `FieldComparer` to be able to pass the type without knowing the closing type.\r\n\r\nThe `FieldComparer<T>` class would define a default implementation of `SetTopValue<TValue>(TValue value)` by casting from `TValue` to `T` using an intermediate cast to object, but can be overridden to eliminate boxing in subclasses where boxing applies.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic abstract SetTopValue(T value);\r\n\r\npublic override SetTopValue<TValue>(TValue value) // Added for .NET to eliminate boxing\r\n{\r\n    SetTopValue((T)(object)value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a little weird because the base type uses a generic method and the subclass is a generic closing type, but given the leaky nature of generics and the fact that some types don't have a reasonable way to pass the generic without also becoming generic this seems like a reasonable compromise. I am open to suggestions if someone can come up with something that seems more natural than this.\r\n\r\n> NOTE: `FieldComparer.CompareValues(object first, object second)` also casts the generic type in the generic overload (the object overload was added in .NET because there is no common type between generic closing types in C#). Perhaps it would be better to make it `FieldComparer.CompareValues<TValue>(TValue first, TValue second)` on the base class as well. This leaks into Lucene.Net.Grouping types, `ISearchGroup.SortValues` and `MergedGroup.TopValues` are also declared as type object[] and may contain numeric types.\r\n>\r\n> I am mentioning this here because it is another method using the same generic type on FieldComparer<T>.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/787435151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/787448843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/429#issuecomment-787448843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/429","id":787448843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NzQ0ODg0Mw==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-28T13:01:42Z","updated_at":"2021-02-28T13:01:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A potential problem with the above approach is that it is difficult to cast `TValue` to a value type, such as `float`.

We cannot make a `BufferedHashAlgorithm` class that works with any `HashAlgorthm` because it doesn't expose APIs to update the algorithm.\r\n2. The raw speed of `BuffferedCrc32Algorithm` is better than a buffered `CRC32`, but the large number of allocations by the former would cause performance degradation.\r\n\r\nSo, while this seemed to be sensible when writing up #255, our understanding of the issues with doing this have changed as we are neither gaining in API usability or in performance. In short, there is no benefit to replacing the `IChecksum` interface with `HashAlgorthm` and it is best to leave it marked internal.\r\n\r\nThanks for putting this together so we could explore this option. You definitely deserve all of the credit for closing #255 and we'd welcome your further participation in the project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/796797535/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/796798831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/255#issuecomment-796798831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/255","id":796798831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5Njc5ODgzMQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-11T15:00:03Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T15:00:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"See #436.

A series of reference type wrappers are made for each numeric type similar to the [Numbers Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberclasses.html) in Java. However, unlike our previous one-off approach to building wrappers whenever reference types are required these will be fully implemented with full tests, and put into `J2N`.\r\n    -  These classes will have all of the same interfaces that numeric types have in .NET including `IConverible` and `IComparable<T>`.\r\n    - To reduce the number of breaking changes introduced to users, they will also use the [implicit operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/user-defined-conversion-operators) to convert the wrapped value to the numeric type without a cast.\r\n4. The number class references are used as the `TWrapper` type in `NumericComparer<TValue, TWrapper>`.\r\n5. Other related systems, such as the field cache may also be refactored to both enforce the use of reference types and to allow the system to pass the numbers class instances all the way through from their creation in `Field` to the `FillFields()` method without having to unwrap and rewrap the numeric value in a reference type.\r\n\r\nOf course, none of this is set in stone, but it is clear that fixing this problem will likely involve breaking some public APIs at least a little so I am moving this to the `4.8.0-beta00015` milestone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/799466687/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/799760495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/308#issuecomment-799760495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/308","id":799760495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5OTc2MDQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-15T21:21:07Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T21:21:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#326 fixed the `Debug.Assert()` issue some time ago.

But we should include this file for copying/conversion in the html/markdown tool so that if/when it changes in lucene and we make a new major version the conflicts are detected and we do a merge\r\n\r\nLooks like the tool that I made into a `dotnet` CLI installable command (https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet-javadoc2markdown) isn't yet in use in the scripts and the (older) `JavaDocToMarkdownConverter` is still in the main repo, and still exists in the \"converted\" branch https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/tree/docs/markdown-converted/4.8.1/src/docs. I just wanted to make you aware of it so we don't have multiple ever-diverging copies. I don't want to delete it from the repo, since the script still depends on it, but we should change that.\r\n\r\nBasically, that tool is now versioned in a NuGet package so you can specify a specific version in the script, or not specify a version and always get the latest copy from NuGet. The latter option isn't available to us by keeping the tool side-by-side in the same branch as the build script. The thought is when we update the tool, those updates should be carried across all of the \"converted\" branches, so the tool definitely shouldn't exist in that branch. If for some reason we need to lock it at a specific version, that can also be done by specifying the version explicitly.\r\n\r\nWe don't have to keep the tool on GitHub - we should move it over to an Apache Git repo so everyone involved in the project can push updates to it. I have named it accordingly, so it should be easy to do. I guess moving the repo could be done at any point, but deleting the copy out of the `master` and `docs/markdown-converted/4.8.1` branches should be done ASAP.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/804408933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/805245974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/447#issuecomment-805245974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/447","id":805245974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTI0NTk3NA==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-23T20:51:18Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T21:04:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rclabo\r\n\r\nThe [documentation for building the website and API docs sites](https://lucenenet.apache.org/contributing/documentation.html) gives some info about how all of this works, but it would be great for someone to poke holes in that documentation to see how well it holds up to scrutiny.\r\n\r\n1. Updates to the website happen in the pre-build stage in this repo.
