The DataType captured in the schema has both SV and MV for primitives so why can't we use that all the way even in functions.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the description, I think we should replace `DataType` with `ColumnDataType` where the SV and MV info is embedded within the type. This way, the data type within the schema and the response will be consistent. That will be a large refactor, so will do that separately.\r\n\r\n> Also, not necessarily related to this PR but I don't think I fully understand the purpose of PinotDataType.

I agree we can force argumentType and parameterType to be the same which can simplify the logic a lot, but that also means user need to explicitly cast the value to the correct type.

Then in order to make schema incompatible change, user has to drop and recreate the table. wdyt?\r\n\r\nThat is totally fine I think. The way I look at this is as follows:\r\n\r\n If we have a production deployment, it is good  in multiple respects to NOT have backward incompatible changes. New columns can be added, and old columns just set to default value in future segments. In a columnar database, the only extra resource consumed is metadata for the column.\r\n\r\nIf this is a non-production env (experimental) it should be ok to drop the data and recreate the table. Maybe we can provide some recipes for saving off existing segments and recreating the segments for the new table. The main problem that users may have is if they drop the table and recreate it the same instant (before the old table goes away). We could (should) add a check in table creation logic that there is no EXTERNALVIEW for a new table being created. If there is, fail the table with a good error message to ask the user to try later.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Good to drop the table in either case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/812701105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/812751014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6721#issuecomment-812751014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6721","id":812751014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjc1MTAxNA==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-02T23:17:29Z","updated_at":"2021-04-02T23:17:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Next step (next PR), we should move `ColumnMetadata` into `segment-spi` and move some functions in `SegmentMetadataImpl` into the `SegmentMetadata` interface.

I have tried \r\nto import codestyle-eclipse.xml and it works well (maintaining one file is much easier that maintaining two).  But I agree to add basic formatting rules as the first step. I can send separate PR to delete codestyle-intellj.xml and update codestyle-eclipse.xml if need be (create a separate issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/issues/6790 to track it).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12423751/114633972-66d15180-9c76-11eb-9f40-9dcd4d8ffbeb.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/819120571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/819138899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6782#issuecomment-819138899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6782","id":819138899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxOTEzODg5OQ==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-14T00:36:38Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T00:36:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mqliang Yes I totally agree maintaining one file is easier and more desired.
