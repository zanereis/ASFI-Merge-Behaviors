For example\r\n``\r\nContextManager.activeSpan().errorOccurred().log(t);\r\n``\r\nBut the author implement is like following:\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n    public void cancel(@Nullable String message, @Nullable Throwable cause) {\r\n        final AbstractSpan span = ContextManager.createLocalSpan(operationPrefix + REQUEST_ON_CANCEL_OPERATION_NAME);\r\n        span.setComponent(ComponentsDefine.GRPC);\r\n        span.setLayer(SpanLayer.RPC_FRAMEWORK);\r\n        ContextManager.continued(snapshot);\r\n\r\n        if (cause != null) {\r\n            span.log(cause);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            super.cancel(message, cause);\r\n        } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n            ContextManager.activeSpan().errorOccurred().log(t);\r\n            throw t;\r\n        } finally {\r\n            ContextManager.stopSpan();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe local span only triggers the log function rather than trigger the 2 functions together. So the local span should always be a normal span. It seems that the author did this on purpose. But I think this situation can be ignored. After all, OAP can determine the status based on Entry Span only.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/688886435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/688892482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5426#issuecomment-688892482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5426","id":688892482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODg5MjQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-08T13:55:59Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T13:55:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"From my understanding, in default, `ContextManager.activeSpan().errorOccurred().log(t);` == `ContextManager.activeSpan().log(t);`, isn't it?\r\n\r\nI know the OAP could determine the exception, I just said, this seems not an issue.
