think this pr should be discussed sufficiently before we merge it in.\r\n\r\nUnlike the scalar type, the type info of dynamic types (such as Array, Map and etc) can not be generated in compile time. For instance, in `get_type_info(const TabletColumn* col)`, the depth of the col should be calculated first and it is unknown until runtime. The optimization for `ArrayType` here is powered by small object optimization technique (cache objects with small depth) but it sacrifice the flexibility for objects with bigger depth.\r\n\r\nI think there are some possible improvements (may be hard to implement): \r\n1. It is reasonable to restrict the max depth to protect our system from suffering serious performance penalty. I was also planning to do this. However, if we can configure the max depth in runtime, it may be better than the hard coded number.\r\n2. `ArrayTypeInfo` can be refactored to store both leaf type info and depth, therefore, we can construct an `ArrayTypeInfo` with any depth in a quick way.

For instance, in `get_type_info(const TabletColumn* col)`, the depth of the col should be calculated first and it is unknown until runtime. The optimization for `ArrayType` here is powered by small object optimization technique (cache objects with small depth) but it sacrifice the flexibility for objects with bigger depth.\r\n> \r\n> I think there are some possible improvements (may hard to implement):\r\n> \r\n> 1. It is reasonable to restrict the max depth to protect our system from suffering serious performance penalty. I was also planning to do this. However, if we can configure the max depth in runtime, it may be better than the hard coded number.\r\n> 2. `ArrayTypeInfo` can be refactored to store both leaf type info and depth, therefore, we can construct an `ArrayTypeInfo` with any depth in a quick way. After that, we may cache the objects with small depth statically and use some cache strategies for objects with large depth to speed up.\r\n> \r\n> All in all, the key problem is how to manage the resource of dynamic types if there are generated dynamically.

Here I use templates and static variables to optimize get scalar type, and I I think that for the design of composite types such as arrays and maps, my changes are only expedient. I think composite types may need to be managed with another set of logic in future, because scalar type is the most used type by users, so performance is very important, PR #8500 has already done some performance \r\n optimization work for this

If we manage the resource created by dynamic types and ignore the static resource for static types, the unified `const TypeInfo*` returned by some functions is inappropriate. I think some functions and some usage for `TypeInfo` should be **SEPARATED** first before apply the  optimization for static types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1082571465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1082577762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/8707#issuecomment-1082577762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/8707","id":1082577762,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5AhtNi","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-30T03:16:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T03:16:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR

1 Timer itself has an overhead, I don't think we need so many Timer by default and collect it in Prod Env. We can use GenericTimer when we meet obvious performance bottleneck in Prod Env or Test Env. We'd better not add more timer than before. So I suggest you just add `ShortPredEvalTime` or using `PredEvalTime` to cover short and vec evaluation. For other Timer, you can disable it by default or using `GeneralDebugTimer` instead. Explaining how to Timer `SegmentIter` is helpful.\r\n> \r\n> 2 `GeneralDebugTimer` is open by default currently, I think we can disable it by default.\r\n\r\nI think there is a scenario that needs to be considered. For example, a certain sql query of a user in an online environment is slow. If the profile is relatively detailed, we can directly use the online environment to analyze the profile through the profile to quickly locate the bottleneck. Instead of adding relevant profile indicators by changing the code, then compiling, deploying, and analyzing the problem.\r\nOf course, the timer itself has an overhead, so there needs to be a trade-off. ReadColumn is a very time consuming operation (shown below), please confirm whether it is necessary?\r\n\r\n```\r\n- BlockLoadTime: 8s695ms\r\n- PredColumnReadTime: 2s536ms\r\n- LazyReadTime: 5s422ms\r\n- ShortPredEvalTime: 433.292ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will delete other new timers and turn off GeneralDebugTimer by default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1084565079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1084697088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/8768#issuecomment-1084697088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/8768","id":1084697088,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5ApyoA","user":{"login":"wangbo","id":12951030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUxMDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12951030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo","html_url":"https://github.com/wangbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-31T14:52:45Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T14:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the key point is how much the Timer cost in Prod Env.\r\nIn my experience,millions times call of Timer could see significant performance drop.\r\nSql runs one by one, Timer may not so cost.\r\nIn Prod Env, a Be may have many sqls runs at the same time, so the Timer cost may big.\r\nI would make a concurrent query test and then Perf for a period of time to see the cpu cost of timer.\r\nIf there is no noticeable increase in cpu time, I think new timer is OK.\r\n\r\nAnd this may not be a trade-off, find online performance bottlenecks is an occasional operation.\r\nBut Timer is called all the time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1084697088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1084718534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/8768#issuecomment-1084718534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/8768","id":1084718534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs5Ap33G","user":{"login":"wangbo","id":12951030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUxMDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12951030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo","html_url":"https://github.com/wangbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-31T15:03:59Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T15:03:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The purpose of this PR to help locate and analyze the query bottleneck is good.\r\nI will do some code refactor to make lazy materialization easier to understand.\r\nSo this PR can be merged first.\r\nPerformance test would be will be included in my next PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/1084718534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
