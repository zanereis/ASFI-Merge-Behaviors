Currently there are 3 types of project: the ones using the old structure, the ones using the new, and some redefining their `<build>` section (most of the time with unnecessary changes). Of course the build works, otherwise we would be in trouble. But I feel the project deserves more cleanup and standardization on how things are done. Then the usual copy/paste of code & configuration will be aligned too when creating new modules. Also the `pom` files will be simpler with less customization at different places within the sub-module tree.\r\n\r\nI agree that the cherry-picking could be cumbersome, if lot of them should happen. It makes me think that it should be merge (if agreed) as the first commit for the next LTS version. This will lower the cherry-pick frictions on backporting fixes. I'm up for handling the effort to backport commits colliding with this one.\r\n\r\nOn the 150+ PR waiting to be merged, I don't see that number really getting to a low value any time soon since the build and check process is pretty long. The rebasing of any of them is trivial, the only exception to newly created file, which would show up as an error pretty quickly since they should be used directly by the PR's code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/346335644/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/346337371","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2263#issuecomment-346337371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2263","id":346337371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjMzNzM3MQ==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-22T12:33:37Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T12:33:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Packaging result: ✔centos6 ✔centos7 ✔debian.

looks overcomplicated, really, search over resourceId is a wrong logic. It should search only against uuds. We discussed the problem in a mail list with @rafaelweingartner.\r\nRight now I'm working on fix for it too. The code is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bwsw/cloudstack/blob/4.10.1-NP/server/src/com/cloud/tags/TaggedResourceManagerImpl.java\r\n\r\nAll marvin component and smoke are passing, and tag specific too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnosetests-2.7 --with-marvin --marvin-config=setup/dev/advanced.cfg -w test/integration/component --with-xunit --xunit-file=/tmp/bvt_selfservice_cases.xml --zone=Sandbox-simulator --hypervisor=simulator -a tags=advanced,required_hardware=false -a speed=0 `pwd`/test/integration/component/test_tags.py\r\n```\r\nI believe, leaving internal id search is a wrong way to deal with it, because they can not and shouldn't appear in API. Also, the code I'm working on includes security fix for listing resource tags because right now the code from the PR doesn't even checks privileges for listing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n @Override\r\n    public List<? extends ResourceTag> listByResourceTypeAndId(ResourceObjectType type, long resourceId) {\r\n        return _resourceTagDao.listBy(resourceId, type);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nMine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n    public List<? extends ResourceTag> listByResourceTypeAndId(ResourceObjectType resourceType, long resourceId) {\r\n        Account caller = CallContext.current().getCallingAccount();\r\n        Pair<Long, Long> accountDomainPair = getAccountDomain(resourceId, resourceType);\r\n        Long domainId = accountDomainPair.second();\r\n        Long accountId = accountDomainPair.first();\r\n        checkResourceAccessible(accountId, domainId, \"Account '\" + caller + \"' doesn't have permissions to list tags\" +\r\n                \" for resource '\" + resourceId + \"' of type '\" + resourceType + \"'.\");\r\n        return _resourceTagDao.listBy(resourceId, resourceType);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, basically the PR:\r\n\r\n1. it doesn't fix the semantical problem allowing to search with internal ids\r\n2. doesn't fix security fault when listing resource tags.\r\n\r\nI need couple of days to finish the code because I want to add account tags feature and have to implement set of marvin tests for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/346590497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/346591263","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/905#issuecomment-346591263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/905","id":346591263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjU5MTI2Mw==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-23T11:15:40Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T11:15:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bwsw I thought this was your PR, sorry for my lack of attention.
