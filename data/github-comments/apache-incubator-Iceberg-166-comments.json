The decision was to go with the builder pattern (a `PartitionSpecBuilder` class) here but to make an attempt to consider the option to directly instantiate a spec using the `PartitionSpec` init method. In Java that class is protected and so you are forced to go through the builder pattern, but it may turn out feasible to allow more flexibility in the python client.\r\n\r\nA consideration to keep in mind is that someone directly instantiating a `PartitionSpec` won't have any checks or other logic that the builder offers. As the builder grows in complexity, I'd imagine the option to directly instantiate a `PartitionSpec` becomes less feasible (we wouldn't want to duplicate the builder logic in an overly complex init method for `PartitionSpec`).\r\n\r\nLet's keep this issue open and as you work on this, feel free to comment here with anything you find that may require reconsidering all of this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1113632408/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1113637923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3616#issuecomment-1113637923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3616","id":1113637923,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CYMQj","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-29T19:08:56Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T19:08:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this since it's completed.

That stack trace will allow us to see where the exception is propagating.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight risk if anything fails after actually committing to the catalog, which we avoid by not doing any work in commit other than returning. That's why `BaseMetastoreCatalog` sets a flag to refresh the table, but the refresh actually happens in the cleanup after the commit. And, if there's any problem in the cleanup then it just warns and stops (which is why @RussellSpitzer's test works).\r\n\r\nIt could be that the OOM happened after the commit succeeded, or at least after the commit was sent to the server and eventually succeeded. But the problem is that OOM should not have triggered the `cleanAll` behavior. It should have prevented all cleanup: `cleanAll` happens when a `RuntimeException` is caught in the commit block, and any further exceptions block cleanup.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1113712458/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1113714389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4666#issuecomment-1113714389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4666","id":1113714389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CYe7V","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-29T20:48:29Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T20:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue Very sorry. unfortunately, in our app we were not able to capture the stack trace.

So we may want to have the logging in the operations (HiveTableOperations, HadoopTableOperations, ... ) themselves?\r\n> \r\n> Good point. But I think a table version string will be there even for a future catalog without a metatdata.json file. It can easily support that, with minor word change. like `Successfully committed to table {} with the new metadata location({})` -> `Successfully committed to table {} with the new version ({})`\r\n> \r\n> Hi @kbendick, what do you think from the perspective of rest API catalog?\r\n\r\nFor the current REST catalog, a file should be loggable. That said, I do agree that it's probably best not to force catalogs to have to always return a new metadata.json.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the REST catalog, presently it wouldn't matter.\r\n\r\nThat said, it looks like there would be quite a n number of places to log this if we did it at the catalog level. Essentially everywhere that `commit` is called..\r\n\r\nFor `HiveCatalog`, that would be:\r\n- `registerTable` (from `Catalog` interface)\r\n- `createTable`\r\n- Several functions in the `BaseMetastoreCatalog`, such as `BaseMetastoreCatalog#BaseMetastoreCatalogTableBuilder::create`.\r\n- The various implementations of `Transactions::commitTransaction` would also need to add logs (which breaks down into `BaseTransaction::commitCreateTransaction`, `BaseTransaction::commitReplaceTransaction`, and 2 more I can see from a simple pass over the code.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**: I agree that having the catalog do the logging would be the ideal way, but realistically that's a lot of additional places to add logs vs a small handful of implementations of `TableOperations::commit` would suffice and generally speaking all of the relevant information is in Table Operations. So in my opinion, as long as the `TableOperations` implementations add the logging themselves, I think that would be simpler.\r\n\r\nFor the RESTCatalog, `RESTTableOperations::updateCurrentMetadata`, which is called at the end of `commit` with the `LoadTableResponse`  - just for clarification on where / how this could be handled in the REST catalog.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1115529855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1115546231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4668#issuecomment-1115546231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4668","id":1115546231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CfeJ3","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-03T02:04:45Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T02:04:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I removed the ordering of fields from the test.

Users may append the same data twice in case of retry.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1116766515/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1116769299","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4578#issuecomment-1116769299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4578","id":1116769299,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85CkIwT","user":{"login":"amogh-jahagirdar","id":87500546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTAwNTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87500546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar","html_url":"https://github.com/amogh-jahagirdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-03T23:54:04Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T23:54:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated, still need to add some tests but @rdblue @kbendick let me know what you think!
