I asked you to help testing, which you partially did. But not having a test environment and relying on a simulator for everything seems a bit naive for me. You might remember that we had many problems when people did LGTM PRs based on the Travis results, which are not reliable.\n\nAs I wrote on Saturday, I was going to test again - with the changes - and post the result, which I did. I will now retest in a clean DC without the commit - GC related -  and post the results. We all expect it to pass, of course. But if it doesn't we need to find out why the \"agnostic\" nature of the implementation is broken.\n\nWe could talk for hours and disagree only on things being agnostic within ACS. I have a few cases in my sleeve. But let's not start again.\n\nDon't give up and say it's useless. At the end we will learn something anyway, even from rants on github.\n\nBy the way, the `smoke/test_routers.py` tests were executed by @remibergsma as well.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/170508275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/170520102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1277#issuecomment-170520102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1277","id":170520102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDUyMDEwMg==","user":{"login":"koushik-das","id":11499860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk5ODYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11499860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das","html_url":"https://github.com/koushik-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koushik-das/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-11T11:59:24Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T11:59:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wilderrodrigues My questions were not in the context of refactor at all. The reason for asking the questions was to highlight the point that for testing config parameters you don't need real hardware to test.

Based on your comments it looks like you never understood what I was trying to say.\n\nAbout testing with real hardware, it is only needed when you want to verify something by actually accessing the VM OR some HV specific scenario needs to be tested. For e.g. ssh to VM for validating certain properties of the VM OR verifying if some n/w rules etc. are programmed properly in VR.

I noticed the commits you pointed out, are pretty old and do not correspond to the code we have in master branch today.\n\nThe Point that @GabrielBrascher touched makes sense to me, have you looked at the piece of code he pointed at?\n\nI looked at the code, the variables you changed are not used. If they should be used, that has to be properly coded, if not, they should be removed.\n\nIn details for you:\nYou changed the method com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.startRouters(RouterDeploymentDefinition), to use the called user as the one returned by the code “_accountMgr.getActiveUser(CallContext.current().getCallingUserId())” and the Account by the one returned by the method“CallContext.current().getCallingAccount();”.\n\nThen, at line 336, it is called the method “com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.startVirtualRouter(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>)” with the aforementioned variables you changed. That method does not use either one use of those variables you changed, it only uses them to execute the method “com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.start(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>, DeploymentPlan)”. Those executions occur at lines 349, 387 or 412, depending on some logic.\n\nAfter that, the method “com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.start(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>, DeploymentPlan)”, receives its parameters and performs its job. However, it does not use the  “User” and “Account” parameters in any of its operations.\n\nAt the end, the variables were not being used before your change and they are not being used now. Therefore, I do not see how that simple change can solve a problem.\n\nDo you intend to alter the code of “com.cloud.network.router.NetworkHelperImpl.start(DomainRouterVO, User, Account, Map<Param, Object>, DeploymentPlan)” too ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/171619337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/171657390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1341#issuecomment-171657390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1341","id":171657390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTY1NzM5MA==","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T14:28:23Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T14:28:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

It has helped readability quite a bit. :)\n\nNow, in case you're interested in improving this code _even further_, may I suggest breaking down the `postVideoCardMemoryConfigBeforeStart` method a bit more? I like what you did separating it into two, but there are still quite a few conditionals within each other and that makes the whole thing look convoluted, not to mention adding up to cyclomatic complexity. Bonus points for adding javadoc style descriptions to the new methods you create like you did to the existing ones.\n\nMy last suggestion would be to write some test cases (unit tests) for the methods you've created. After that, as far as I can assess, this PR will be perfect. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/171798749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/171865987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1321#issuecomment-171865987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1321","id":171865987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTg2NTk4Nw==","user":{"login":"agneya2001","id":6416480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTY0ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6416480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001","html_url":"https://github.com/agneya2001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agneya2001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-15T03:54:16Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T03:54:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"tag should not be a reason for incompatibility. that is you can mover from a service offering that is similar but with any other set of tags.  we should just do away with check on tags.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/171865987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/171885529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1321#issuecomment-171885529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1321","id":171885529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTg4NTUyOQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-15T06:54:11Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T06:54:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 for removing the check.
