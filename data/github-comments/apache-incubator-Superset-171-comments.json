Check out some of the recordings from above as well – it followed the idea of the toggle being front and center and also serving as the indicator which is something we discussed briefly on Friday.\r\n\r\n## Toggling the Published Status of a Dashboard \r\n#### (The logged in user is \"Admin User\" in this example)\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tresdon/misc_public/master/images/superset/publishing_dash.gif)\r\n\r\nNote a few things:\r\n1. This user has the \"all_datasource_access\" permission so they can see all of the dashboards in the system.\r\n2. One can only change the publish status by putting the dashboard into edit mode. \r\n\r\n## Not being able to toggle the status\r\n#### (The logged in user is \"Gamma User\" in this example)\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tresdon/misc_public/master/images/superset/cant_change_status.gif)\r\n\r\nNote a few things:\r\n1. The user cannot see the dashboard titled \"No datasources for gamma\" from the previous image. This is because this user doesn't have access to any of the datasources backing the slices used in the dashboard.\r\n2. The user can see the dashboard they do because it is published AND they have access to at least one slice.\r\n3. The option for publishing a dashboard does not appear for this user\r\n\r\nSome of the design considerations we discussed are as follows:\r\n- Publishing a dashboard is essentially the same as putting a dashboard into production right now so we need to make sure the visual weight of the action is reflected appropriately in the design of the feature\r\n- This feature needs to be discoverable and have appropriate verbage that makes it clear how discoverable and visible the dashboard is. Perhaps public / private might be a more clear distinction for what this feature does.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/424037938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/424064448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5802#issuecomment-424064448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5802","id":424064448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDA2NDQ0OA==","user":{"login":"kakoni","id":812150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjE1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni","html_url":"https://github.com/kakoni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakoni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T17:49:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T17:49:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mistercrunch I thought I already did?;) https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5802/commits/2f67a04679de80fe2aead114ac06f78169f71485","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/424064448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/424077400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5958#issuecomment-424077400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5958","id":424077400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDA3NzQwMA==","user":{"login":"shobhitverma","id":5643690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDM2OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5643690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma","html_url":"https://github.com/shobhitverma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shobhitverma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T18:29:32Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T18:29:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That was very helpful.

To confirm, the current behavior/proposal is:\r\n\r\n#### In welcome page and crud view\r\nFor admins\r\n- show all dashboards regardless of status\r\n- show a column that indicates the status of the dashboard (published, draft)\r\n\r\nFor everyone else\r\n- show only public dashboards, and dashboards you own\r\n- show a column that indicates the status of the dashboard (published, draft) //not sure if this was your intention, but I think this would make sense)\r\n\r\n#### In profile page\r\n- created content tab: show all dashboard you've created, regardless of status //it seems like it would be helpful to know the publication status here, too. like, \"oh shit i forgot I was working on these, maybe I should publish them\" / sanity check that you haven't published your work-in-progress stuff yet\r\n- favorites tab: show favorited dashboards, regardless of publication status\r\n\r\n#### On dashboard itself\r\nFor dashboard owner, for an unpublished dashboard\r\n- show \"draft\" label next to title\r\n- while in edit mode, you can select \"Publish Dashboard\" //nit: if we keep this, the D probably shouldn't be capitalized\r\n\r\nFor dashboard owner, for a published dashboard\r\n- show nothing next to the title\r\n- you can unpublish it\r\n\r\nFor everyone else\r\nUnpublished dashboard\r\n- show \"draft\" label next to title\r\n- you can favorite it and it will appear in your favorites on your profile page\r\n- can't edit status\r\n\r\nPublished dashboard\r\n- show nothing\r\n- you can favorite it and it will appear in your favorites on your profile page\r\n- can't edit status\r\n\r\n#### Feedback\r\n### \r\nI think the \"draft\" label is a lot clearer than the eye icon. Although I originally suggested putting it in the dropdown, I think @elibrumbaugh has a good point that the corresponding publish action might be too buried in the drop-down and I like the idea of having it as its own separate button. I also think it could work as a toggle (where the indicator is also the button to flip), as long as it's not an eye icon (since we're intentionally making it visible even if it's not published). I think using words is also preferable to icons because then it's easy to map to the statuses that we'd show in the crud/welcome view, and I really like that you can understand the intention of the author of the dashboard as a consumer of a dashboard. I defer to @elibrumbaugh/design though.\r\n\r\nWith regards to terminology, I currently prefer published/draft because I think it feels closer to what the product behavior is. Public/private could be a little ambiguous (does public mean anyone can see it, even outside the company? Also if it were me, if it said private, I would assume that *no one* can view it, and that's not the case (and that's a bad mistake to make)).
