An connection pool makes acquiring a scarce resource less expensive, but it is not cost-free.  By taking a connection when the pool is under load, the following could occur:\n- This code may request a connection when none are available causing the connection pool to create another ad hoc connection or blocking the thread until a connection becomes available -- dependent on the pool configuration.\n- This code may exhaust the last connection in the pool causing other thread(s) to create ad hoc connection(s) or to block waiting for a connection to become available -- dependent on the pool configuration.\n\nThere are variety of patterns that can be employed to address this problem.   I lean towards a construct such as the following:\n\n```\nTransaction transaction = new Transaction(USAGE_DB).attempt(new TransactionWork() {\n\n      public void execute(final Connection connection) throws SQLException{\n\n             // Do database work ...\n      }\n\n}\n```\n\nThe `Transaction.attempt` method wraps the call to the passed `TransactionWork.execute` method with the following boilerplate that appears throughout the code base:\n1. Capturing the current database ID from `TransactionLegacy`\n2. Open a connection to the requested database\n3. Handling exceptions including translation and proper logging\n4. Aborting/commiting/closing the transaction via `TransactionLegacy` as needed\n5. If necessary, switching `TransactionLegacy` back to the previous database ID\n\nThese steps assume that `TransactionLegacy` has a `switch` method that changes the `ThreadLocal` tracking the current database ID without consuming a connection from the pool.\n\nI prefer this approach because it allows DAO to declare transactional blocks in a side-effect free manner.  This form of code should be immune to a replacement of `TransationLegacy` because it only relies on the JDBC API and makes no assumptions about the call flow.  It also yields a `Transaction` class that can be unit tested with a little bit of mocking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134245543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134257627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/738#issuecomment-134257627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/738","id":134257627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDI1NzYyNw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-24T15:49:56Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T15:49:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[cloudstack-pull-rats

The first:\n\n```\norg.libvirt.LibvirtException: Controller 'cpuacct' is not wanted, but 'cpu' is co-mounted: Invalid argument\n```\n\nThis is due to the co-mount: both 'cpu' and 'cpuacct' are on one mount point, and our previous config instructs it to use only 'cpu'. So, the 'cpuacct' is `not wanted` by our config. This was solved in my PR by relying on the default.\n\nThe second issue:\n\n```\nunsupported configuration: CPU tuning is not available on this host\n```\n\nThis issue also went away by updating the `libvirtd` config. When I look at the Libvirt source (https://github.com/virtualopensystems/libvirt/blob/master/src/qemu/qemu_cgroup.c#L635) I see this error is thrown in qemu_cgroup.c I assume the VIR_ERR_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED aka `unsupported configuration` also has to do with the rather weird cgroup config that we put there before but I don't know for sure.\n\nIf you have some time, please give it a go. I'll also ask @wilderrodrigues to review it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134363088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/134364759","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/729#issuecomment-134364759","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/729","id":134364759,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNDM2NDc1OQ==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-24T20:19:47Z","updated_at":"2015-08-24T20:19:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shwetaag Could you change the title to: \"CLOUDSTACK-8757: Test to verify if FTP modules are loaded in VR\" as right now it looks like there is a defect, which there is not.\n\nAlso, could you post the test results please.
