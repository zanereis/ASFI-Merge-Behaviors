I think setting a cache_timeout of `0` means \"forever\", so you probably want to set a very small value like \"1\". I'm not sure if negative value will effectively set the caching to not happen. \r\n\r\nOn the longer run, I'm not sure how to handle this as we cannot just make a cache key based on the rendered SQL query. The only reason we cannot do this (that I can think of right now) is that relative time filters like \"90 days ago\" get transformed into real values, and what we want the cache key to be based on is \"90 days ago\", not a hard value. If it's only that, we **could** perhaps pass dummy values to the time filter and cache that along with the relative time inputs, but that assumes that the query generation is a deterministic process, which seems like a brittle/dangerous assumption.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/429552605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/429553865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6065#issuecomment-429553865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6065","id":429553865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTU1Mzg2NQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-13T16:10:39Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T16:10:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/429553865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/429555763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5270#issuecomment-429555763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5270","id":429555763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTU1NTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-13T16:34:52Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T16:34:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Is
