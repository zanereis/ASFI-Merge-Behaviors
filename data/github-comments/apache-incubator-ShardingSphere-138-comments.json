I would like to discuss this feature with you and @terrymanu. Let us light up our minds!\r\n\r\n`ThreadLocal` is designed for `ShardingSphere` to get specific sharding values from users. But `an average user` will not care about `ThreadLocal ` or not, and he or she just wants to get one instance of `hintManger`. \r\n\r\nIf this function always returns the same one, it is likely to confuse users that `hintManger` is in`Singleton pattern`. Therefore, they might believe that the same `hintManger` will be returned in different threads, though. \r\n\r\nOne important point here is that how we tell users the information that `hintManger` is going to return the same one only in the current thread.\r\n\r\nThat is my opinion about this feature, what do you think? @SirMin @terrymanu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/660058695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/660072906","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6375#issuecomment-660072906","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6375","id":660072906,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MDA3MjkwNg==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-17T12:10:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T12:10:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"it has been fixed in master branch.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6299","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/660072906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/660074273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6374#issuecomment-660074273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/6374","id":660074273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MDA3NDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-17T12:14:32Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T12:35:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"it's a bug.

current situation is that different threads are also returning different objects, and without looking at the source code, I subconsciously think that this should be the object held by the current
