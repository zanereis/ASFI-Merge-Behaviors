There's no problem with empty tiers yet. However, our tests create tiers as part of their normal processing, and we'd like to treat these as temporary tiers:  Create a tier, use it for testing, and then delete the tier.

Since the recent decision to move to time-based releases, we have not been necessarily marking all PRs with the milestone (just \"important/blocker\" ones). So the best way to find them is trawling the git commit history for the 0.11.0 branch.\r\n- Put TLS & Authentication/authorization extension points next to each other as the first two points, and insert some language in the preamble (\"Major new features include…\") about how this release is a big deal from a security perspective.\r\n- The \"Updating from 0.10.1\" section should have something about the setting introduced in #4944.\r\n- The \"Updating from 0.10.1\" section is scarily long, but many of the points are actually not that big of a deal. I'd suggest keeping the ones that _are_ a big deal in their own subsections (like they are now) but grouping together all the minor ones into an \"other\" subsection. Also group together all the ones that only apply to extension authors.\r\n- There's a \"Placeholder\" in the notes for some reason.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/337723581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/337724528","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4876#issuecomment-337724528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4876","id":337724528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzcyNDUyOA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-18T20:53:22Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T20:53:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Suggested

(You could check if its avg value is too high)\r\n\r\nThe workflow is that if a buffer is failed to be emitted, it goes to a separate \"fail queue\" (reflected by `emitter/buffers/failed`), and if it is successfully emitted from there, it doesn't return to the `reuseQueue`. So the number of allocated buffers could grow indefinitely. I would keep it a delta metric, `emitter/buffers/failed` above zero could also allow to spot problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, I fixed description of `emitter/buffers/reuseQueue`, it was not correct.\r\n\r\n> Btw, do you suspect bugs in the emitter that caused you to add these metrics?\r\n\r\nI would say not bugs, but the way the code is written, may lead to uncontrolled growth of the amount of buffers, if there are network problems with emitting. We are exploring that at the moment.\r\n\r\n> How do these metrics get emitted if the emitter is not working right?\r\n\r\nThanks, I didn't think about this before. At least HttpPostEmitter logs something when it couldn't emit a buffer, so it could be spotted in logs. Also in case of network problems, emitting old events doesn't block the new events, so if problems are gone, we could see new events. But in this case the information about problems could be lost, if we don't have gauge `emitter/buffers/allocated` metric. So I think I'm going to change it's to gauge indeed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/338282140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/338309334","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4890#issuecomment-338309334","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4890","id":338309334,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODMwOTMzNA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T20:05:26Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T20:05:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@himanshug pushed a new commit addressing your comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/338309334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
