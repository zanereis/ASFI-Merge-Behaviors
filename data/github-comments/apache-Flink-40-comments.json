exactly. Let's at the moment I land in the following situtaion. \n1. I want to create a job which includes the [statistics collection facility proposed by @tammymendt](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-1297). \n2. In order to do that, my project needs to set `flink-contrib` with scope `compile` and use it in the final artifact (even if I am building a _thin_ jar which is going to be submitted to a standalone flink cluster).\n3.

@shghatge! Thank you for the update :)\n\nI left some comments inline. There are still some formatting issues in the code. Please, carefully go through your changes and try to be consistent. Also, there are still several warning regarding types, unused annotations, unused variables. Can you please try to remove them? Your IDE should have a setting that gives you the list of warnings.\n\nRegarding the tests, better create new test files for your methods, since you need to test with files and currently other tests use `collect()`.\n\nFinally, I find the `types()` methods a bit confusing. Could we maybe have separate types methods for the vertices and edges? e.g. `typesEdges(keyType, valueType)`, `typesEdges(keyType)`, `typesVertices(keyType, valueType)` and `typesVertices(keyType)`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118173012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118177927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/881#issuecomment-118177927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/881","id":118177927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODE3NzkyNw==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-02T21:48:28Z","updated_at":"2015-07-02T21:49:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am a bit out of context here, but I believe this PR should be deleted :) Or at least be named something else than \"My branch\".

Chiwan, I had some comments on the code.\n\nIn a more general sense, I have some concerns about the rationale of including an algorithm that by its nature does not scale to large datasets in a library like FlinkML. \nFlinkML is supposed to be a system _\"that is scalable and can deal with problems of various sizes, whether your data size is measured in megabytes or terabytes and beyond.\"_, as stated in our vision.\n\nPerhaps we can move this topic to the mailing list, for me I would vote to not include algorithms that do not scale to FlinkML.\n\nPersonally I would like to see an effort on scalable approximate nearest neighbors instead.\nIn the linked JIRA there was another contributor interested in implementing approximate NN, but seems to not have made any progress. Would you be interested in working on that?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118807403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118832384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/880#issuecomment-118832384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/880","id":118832384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODgzMjM4NA==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T11:55:29Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T11:55:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, I've closed the JIRA. can you close the PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118832384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118888815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/877#issuecomment-118888815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/877","id":118888815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODg4ODgxNQ==","user":{"login":"shghatge","id":6418348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6418348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge","html_url":"https://github.com/shghatge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shghatge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T15:20:03Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T15:20:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updated PR\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118888815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/118891421","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/877#issuecomment-118891421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/877","id":118891421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODg5MTQyMQ==","user":{"login":"andralungu","id":2550549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTA1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2550549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu","html_url":"https://github.com/andralungu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andralungu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T15:28:59Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T15:28:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see the requirements have been fulfilled here.

is a very nice idea, thank you for the contribution! The numbers look quite encouraging.\n\nI need to look into this carefully, as it touches a very sensitive part of the system. It will probably take me a bit of time.\n\nHere are some initial comments:\n- The integration tests seem to be failing, this change apparently triggers a stack-overflow at some point. Have a look at the logs of the Travis CI build.\n- Can we add a flag to the hash-table, to enable/disable the bloom-filters? That would make it easier for future comparisons.\n- Could you include a standalone mini benchmark similar to the one you did where you posted the numbers here? A simple standalone Java executable that creates the hash table and feeds some generated records through it (with bloom filters activated and deactivated)? It would not start a full Flink cluster, but only test the HashJoin in isolation.\n  We like to include some of those mini bechmarks for performance critical parts, and re-run them once in a while to determine how the performance behaves at that point.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/119136367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/119137396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/887#issuecomment-119137396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/887","id":119137396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExOTEzNzM5Ng==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-07T09:35:31Z","updated_at":"2015-07-07T09:35:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think all in all, this looks good.\n\nWe have another change by @mxm pending that changes the accumulators to do live updates during runtime.
