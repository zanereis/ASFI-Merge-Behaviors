I have updated the patch to address all the comments. I have added one integration test to simulate the log directory failure and verify that producer will receive NotLeaderForPartitionException. Note that producer request does not necessarily trigger IOException immediately after log directory failure because log append operation uses mmap and its write operation to disk is delayed. On the other hand, our write operation to checkpoint file can see IOException immediately because it uses FileChannel. And if the IOException is triggered when broker writes to checkpoint file, ProduceResponse will show NotLeaderForPartitionException instead of KafkaStorageException.\r\n\r\nI will try to add another test to verify that producer can send message after retry.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311594553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311597230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929#issuecomment-311597230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2929","id":311597230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTU5NzIzMA==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T08:48:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T08:48:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junrao It seems that @becketqin has finished reviewing the patch and I think the KIP-112 implementation is in good shape.

After writing the code I realize that adding that check doesn't really do anything. It would just be between the JMX code and the for loop over output. Since getting any stdout output would require that we've been assigned partitions, the loop effectively enforces that condition. The only thing we would gain by adding that check is some notification that we never successfully assigned partitions in the case that we get no output, but that seems like a very unusual case that we probably don't need to specifically catch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311714424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311715051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3455#issuecomment-311715051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3455","id":311715051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTcxNTA1MQ==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T16:31:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T16:31:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

agree with @ewencp that adding the `wait_until` check for assigned partitions doesn't make sense in the context of these changes, since the presence of stdout implies that partitions are assigned. \r\n\r\nHowever, we do have tests that don't depend on consuming messages, but do depend on having partitions assigned, like the `produce_consume_validate.py` which explicitly checks for assigned partitions. See https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/tests/kafkatest/tests/produce_consume_validate.py#L53\r\n\r\nIn particular, in the `produce_consume_validate` context, it is possible that the topic being consumed from is empty when you start the consumer. In that case, waiting on `has_partitions_assigned` is the only way you can be sure that the consumer is ready and will not miss any messages from the producer which starts later.\r\n\r\nThat is the only use of `has_partitions_assigned` that I know of, and it doesn't apply here. So I think we can leave it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311812433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311812910","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3454#issuecomment-311812910","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3454","id":311812910,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTgxMjkxMA==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T22:44:25Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T22:44:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

As Ismael said, this does seem a little trickier than reordering the scheduler shutdown. For example, it seems problematic for the shutdown logic in `LogManager` to have to contend with any of the background scheduled tasks. A few alternatives come to mind:\r\n\r\n1. Maybe the scheduler needs to add support for removing a scheduled task? Then we can remove the tasks manually before proceeding with shutdown logic.\r\n2. The exceptional case from the JIRA shows that the event which caused the unexpected call to `schedule` was a response from a replica fetch request. Maybe there is a way to add a check somewhere in that path to see if the broker is shutting down.\r\n3. Maybe instead of raising an exception when we receive a call to `schedule`, we should just log a warning?\r\n\r\nThere might be other options as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311824584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/311824795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929#issuecomment-311824795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2929","id":311824795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTgyNDc5NQ==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T00:00:41Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T00:00:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junrao
