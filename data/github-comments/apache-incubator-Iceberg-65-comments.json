Instead, Spark needs to define how it will pass path-based tables to catalogs, and what the behavior requirements are for those tables. Right now, no one has done the work to find out what the behavior of v1 is or to try to build consensus in the Spark community about what it should be.

I thought he was talking about default catalogs, but now that I've thought about this a bit more there's still a problem if there is no Iceberg catalog configured in the environment. In 2.4, there is no need to configure any Iceberg catalog and we should support the same case, where a user wants to load a table and hasn't configured any catalogs in 3.0.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how we want to do that exactly. One idea is to ensure that at least one catalog is registered by creating the properties for it.

If iceberg provide schema management tools like avro, may be we can also manage schema by Iceberg.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741473849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741487016","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1893#issuecomment-741487016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1893","id":741487016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTQ4NzAxNg==","user":{"login":"zhangjun0x01","id":25563794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTYzNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25563794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T02:35:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T02:35:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@openinx  could you help me review the pr when you have time ,thanks ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741487016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741592505","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1831#issuecomment-741592505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1831","id":741592505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTU5MjUwNQ==","user":{"login":"GintokiYs","id":51935076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTM1MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51935076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs","html_url":"https://github.com/GintokiYs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GintokiYs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T07:36:06Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T07:36:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The property engine.hive.enabled needs to be set to true and added to the table properties when creating the Iceberg table.\r\n```\r\nMap<String, String> tableProperties = new HashMap<String, String>();

AFAIK the only exception is the Schema level struct.\r\nI have been thinking about 2 other solutions:\r\n- Move field matching to be based on the ordering of the fields. We can do it by adding a new input to parameter to `SchemaWithPartnerVisitor<P, R>.PartnerAccessors<P>.fieldPartner(P partnerStruct, int fieldId, String name, int fieldOrderId)`. I do not like this because I do not feel that Struct fields should have specific ordering. It could work, because we are the ones who generate the ObjectInspectors, but still...\r\n- Add the field name to the ObjectInspectors themselves when generating them for the Schema. I do not like this because then we will have specific ObjectInspector instances we have to create and drop.\r\n\r\nSo this is why I have kept the current one which has its own drawbacks, so I am happy to go for a more general solution if we find one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741595522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741624785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1873#issuecomment-741624785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1873","id":741624785,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTYyNDc4NQ==","user":{"login":"raptond","id":30231978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjMxOTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30231978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond","html_url":"https://github.com/raptond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raptond/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T08:43:53Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T08:43:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All comments taken care.

I don't know how people are using Spark3 and if catalogs are widely adopted so I don't know how bad of a break it is. Option 1 is as you say rather ugly but is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nMy understanding for Option 1 is the following:\r\n* check if the requested catalog (or current catalog) is able to handle Iceberg\r\n* if yes great, else create and register a `HiveCatalog` and replace the requested catalog w/ the created one\r\n\r\nThis is rather woolly as I don't think we should change the catalog and I don't know how to reliably determine if a catalog supports Iceberg. A `CatalogPlugin` may be a delegating catalog or something that handles Iceberg tables but doesn't extend our `BaseCatalog`.\r\n\r\nI suppose option 3 is to proceed but warn that we can't guarantee the user is actually writing an Iceberg table.

I don't see a way around registering a catalog, so I think we should do it and also use that to maintain compatibility. So here's what I think behavior should be:\r\n\r\n1. Always register a default Iceberg catalog that is a HiveCatalog using the HMS URI from hive-site.xml, like what you've done.\r\n2. Use the `/` check for paths. If the table ref is a path, then load it from the default Iceberg catalog (any catalog works).\r\n3. If the table ref has a catalog, use that catalog (if it doesn't support Iceberg, that's fine because we can't guess or replace it)\r\n4. If the table ref does not have a catalog, use the current catalog\r\n5. If the current catalog is the session catalog and is not an `IcebergSessionCatalog`, then replace it with the default Iceberg catalog\r\n6. If the current catalog is not the session catalog, use it even if it doesn't support Iceberg\r\n\r\nThat keeps behavior identical and also follows Spark's rules for identifiers. The only time that we use the default Iceberg catalog for a Hive identifier is if there is nothing new in Spark 3 that overrides the behavior to use a different catalog, and if the session catalog (equivalent to the default in 2.4) can't handle Iceberg.\r\n\r\nOptionally, paths could be loaded from the session catalog if it is an `IcebergSessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741929560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/741941924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1898#issuecomment-741941924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1898","id":741941924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTk0MTkyNA==","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T17:49:20Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T17:49:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@islandgit: The method was introduced by [HIVE-15269](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15269).

Clearly from my above comments, I'm confused about how it all works together.\r\n\r\nRyan's email helped me a lot: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1c357c7867234fed58b12f0cba6e9d2c13ed1af94b8d922ffe3a3def%40%3Cdev.iceberg.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nFor this PR it sounds like it's still in flux but my understanding is (please correct the things I have wrong):\r\n\r\nFor spark as an example the config barriers are:\r\n\r\n- User passes:\r\n- - command line args + hadoop config files on disk\r\n- Spark will push down:\r\n- - DataSourceV2 options + hadoop config\r\n- Spark source will initialize the catalog object (catalog client?) with:\r\n- - Map<String, String> argument (called properties?) + hadoop config\r\n\r\nInside the catalog the config sources seem like:\r\n\r\n- Map<String, String> arguments: system/compute constraints (like running on prem vs on an ec2 instance)\r\n- HadoopConfig: for setting up HadoopFileSystem\r\n- CatalogProperties: ~~I'm not sure what these are? If it's hive or glue would it be a Map<String, String> per table entry or would it be for the catalog as a whole? In ryan's email I think it says that it should just give the location and that it is an iceberg table (but what if it should also say if it's an iceberg table backed by aws vs gcp and how to read it?) [edit: I'm wrong. I don't understand what he's saying fully here: ```Config in the Hive MetaStore is only used to identify that a table is\r\n   Iceberg and point to its metadata location. All other config in HMS is\r\n   informational. For example, the input format is FileInputFormat so that\r\n   non-Iceberg readers cannot actually instantiate the format (it’s abstract)\r\n   but it is available so they also don’t fail trying to load the class.\r\n   Table-specific config should not be stored in table or serde properties.```]~~ These are the same as the arguments\r\n- TableProperties: table specific infromation\r\n\r\nIt sounds like for tables which use S3FileIO:\r\n- HadoopConfig should be ignored since we're not using HadoopFileIO.\r\n- Map<String, String> arguments should give enough info to reach the catalog.\r\n- Then catalog properties should be mixed with some arguments which have constraints on where the compute is running (eg proxy for on prem vs an ec2 machine). This should give enough info to be able to read the table's json file.\r\n- Then the catalog properties should be ignored and the table properties should be mixed with the arguments. This should give enough information to read and write to the table?\r\n\r\nShould a file io be created just for the json file and then a new file io be created for the other part of the table after reading the table properties? (manifest list/ manifest + data files?)\r\n\r\nWhere should the kms key id go? Is that a per table thing to write new data files (table properties) or is it a user/system defined property which should go in the arguments?\r\n\r\nIt would help me a ton if that was written out somewhere (it might be in Jack's docs that he's written up I still have to go take a look)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/742112667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/742173682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1525#issuecomment-742173682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1525","id":742173682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjE3MzY4Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T01:30:50Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T01:30:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RussellSpitzer, I noted a few more changes needed in exception handling.
