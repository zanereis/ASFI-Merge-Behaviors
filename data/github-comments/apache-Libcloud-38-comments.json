What I can say:\r\n\r\n * only functions of ECSDriverTestCase that start with `test_` are considered as tests, such as test_list_nodes\r\n * in `ECSDriverTestCase.setUp`, the connection class of the `ECSDriver` instance is defined as `ECSMockHttp`, because we don't want to make real requests in tests, but use mocking instead\r\n* `ECSMockHttp`, defined lower in the file, is a subclass of `MockHttp` which is defined in `libcloud/test/__init__.py` and this is where all the magic happens: when `ECSDriver` makes a request, `MockHttp._get_requests` will try to find a method in `MockHttp` to call.\r\n\r\nFor `test_list_nodes`, for example, the endpoint is `DescribeInstances`, but instead `ESMockHttp._DescribeInstances` will be called, and it only reads from the `describe_instances.xml` fixture, which is in `libcloud/test/compute/fixtures/ecs/describe_instances.xml` and this is from this file that things like `iZ28n7dkvovZ` come from.\r\n\r\nAlways make sure that your test fails without your code, and consider using a debugger such as pudb to understand what happens. So you could add `import pudb; pudb_set_trace()` in`test_list_nodes` then run `pytest -k ecs -s` and try to follow what happens. Or you can use `print()`.\r\n\r\nDoes that help?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/355883772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/355939347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1135#issuecomment-355939347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1135","id":355939347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTkzOTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-08T11:13:14Z","updated_at":"2018-01-08T11:13:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Added a test case in 0710d23de52a1c2c4841937e4c7c17b81950b9ae and merged it into trunk.\r\n\r\nI also included small optimization in 484e02a6395f3f05989a90b88bdb4c9b583ab4d7.
