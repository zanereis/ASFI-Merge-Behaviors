It might feel like I put a lot of comments/questions that are designed to prevent things from being merged. That's not my intent. We get a lot of submissions which work very well for a specific use case and \"scratch your own itch\" as it were, and people don't evaluate/aren't aware of a lot of the negative/edge cases which can arise in the many scenarios users deploy NiFi into. If you're not interested in trying to address all the possible combinations and failure scenarios, that's ok. We always appreciate sharing these features with the community, and often suggest hosting the code for the custom processors in your own repository so interested users can build and deploy them locally. To be accepted and bundled as part of the core project, however, we have a (non-legally obligated) responsibility to support and maintain the code, so we have to reach a certain threshold of familiarity and basic behavioral consistency in order to do that. Thanks.
