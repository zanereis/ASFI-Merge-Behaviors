Probably what you care about on expression level is Java method execution speeds, but monitoring that is an `ObjectWrapper` concern.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1859230267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/1860499559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/89#issuecomment-1860499559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/89","id":1860499559,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAn9g0s5u5Phn","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-18T13:27:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T13:27:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have refined this quite heavily.

I'm not sure what step of the Ant builds adds these, but I can't really see the value in adding them. That said, they are trivial to add, if neccesary.\r\n- As described in the opening comment of the PR, I have added a couple of package private `SuppressFBWarnings` classes to avoid the need to preprocess the source files.

So, we have to remove `buildTimestamp=...`, but everything else can stay.\r\n\r\nOk thanks. I discovered one problem: The tokens like `nightly_@timestampInVersion@` in comments of `version.properties` were replaced too (I think in [FreemarkerRootPlugin](https://github.com/apache/freemarker/blob/2.3-gae/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/freemarker/build/FreemarkerRootPlugin.kt#L67C56-L67C56) ). I think that this can easily be forgotten during a release. Thus I changed the comment in 9677cda slightly to `nightly_[timestampInVersion]` (square brackets `[]` instead of `@@`).  \r\n\r\nThat way during a release you only have to adjust the real properties `version`, `mavenVersion`, `versionForOSGi` and do not care about the comments. If you know a better solution to avoid the replacement in comments, I'm glad to know. \r\n\r\n\r\nFew more words to my latest 3 commits:\r\n\r\nc9aa766978359232410aabb8808c3b1e2faa182a : I decided to NOT remove the `buildTimestamp` for now, because removal made some testcases fail and the buildtimestamp is also referenced in code (Version.java). I wanted to avoid too many changes for this PR here for now, before having a discussion about it. \r\nSo for now buildtimestamp is a fixed value now (`buildTimestamp=1980-02-01T00:00:00Z`). So it is rather meaningless, but at least backwards-compatible for the current code.\r\n\r\n17ee92ca2f6dee2a6c59954d94e55ba1ad5fc11b and 5bcc56f18bbd675a042b16c2947bddf9891a0c6f: here I think I fixed the problem related to executability of `gradlew` which you pointed out. \r\n\r\n> `gradlew`: I meant, it's not executable in the source distribution tar.\r\n> `tar -tvf apache-freemarker-gae-src-2.3.33-SNAPSHOT.tgz` gives `-rw-r--r-- 0/0 8941 1970-01-02 01:00 gradlew`.\r\n> But I just realized that that's already broken in the `2.3-gae` branch. But I guess if I fix that these, the `filePermissions { unix(\"rw-r--r--\") }` you added will collide with that.\r\n\r\nI just applied the permissions and reproducible attributes (file timestamps, ordering) to the contents of the .jar files e.g. in `build/libs` like `freemarker-gae-2.3.33-sources.jar `, `freemarker-gae-2.3.33-javadoc.jar`, `freemarker-gae-2.3.33.jar`. \r\n\r\nIMO these three files are what's need to be reproducible.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > You mean more specific to \"what exact Java version (incl. build) to use and to do to get the exact same build result\"?\r\n> \r\n> Yes. Like is it Oracle, is it OpenJDK, etc., and then which build exactly. I assume we have to specify that, and from there, the JDK will be pretty much always downloaded at first build (because the user doesn't have exactly the same version).\r\n> \r\n\r\nHmm regarding exact vendor and version. I did a little more investigation. \r\nIn short: I have not really found out yet how to specify this in such detail.\r\nIt looks like `foo-jay` works based on gradle toolchain definitions: see https://github.com/gradle/foojay-toolchains?tab=readme-ov-file#matching-toolchain-specifications \r\n\r\nI found that you could specify the vendor. \r\nI also checked a few .buildspec of the reproducible central guys files e.g. https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/blob/master/content/io/opentelemetry/instrumentation/opentelemetry-1.14.0-alpha.buildspec which mostly define jdk=11, jdk=17 and the like. Less often I have found more specific definition like jdk=17.0.3.  but no vendor like Oracle, Temurin.\r\n\r\nThe guide e.g. https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-reproducible-builds.html mentions:\r\n\r\n> Generally depend on the major version of the JDK used to compile. (Even with source/target defined, each major JDK version changes the generated bytecode) \r\n\r\nAnd I have the feeling that this is  the way it is treated.\r\n\r\nThe `.buildinfo` file ([see here](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/#buildinfo-file)) seems to contain more details, but it seems to be just for documentation how a build has been created... (used to lookup by humans not by tools).\r\n\r\n`After 3 years of work on Reproducible Builds, it has been found more useful as an internal file format: Reproducible Central and its .buildspec format is more what we need to check that Reproducible Builds results has been achieved. .buildinfo just records a build, be it reproducible or not.\r\n`\r\n\r\nSo I don't really know how to proceed. My gut feeling is that we could keep it like it is now.\r\nWe could just explain e.g. in the README which JDK you need for a reproducible build (and make a recommendation) and then it is up to the developer bringing it's machine to this state. \r\n\r\nWe could provide \r\n\r\n```\r\nplugins {\r\n    id(\"org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention\") version \"0.7.0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto make it easier to build right away, but document in the README that for a reproducible build a specific JDK is required. \r\n\r\n\r\n> > How do you create this `apache-freemarker-gae-src-2.3.33-SNAPSHOT.tgz`?

I discovered one problem: The tokens like `nightly_@timestampInVersion@` in comments of `version.properties` were replaced too (I think in [FreemarkerRootPlugin](https://github.com/apache/freemarker/blob/2.3-gae/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/freemarker/build/FreemarkerRootPlugin.kt#L67C56-L67C56) ). I think that this can easily be forgotten during a release. Thus I changed the comment in [9677cda](https://github.com/apache/freemarker/commit/9677cdafe783ee46d87a98fd585b939b0b6f50b2) slightly to `nightly_[timestampInVersion]` (square brackets `[]` instead of `@@`).\r\n\r\nNow that that the timestamp causes complications, we should just change the convention to `version=2.3.33-nightly`. Pretty much nobody cares about the build timestamp of a snapshot version after all. (Of course it would be also possible to set the `filter` so that it doesn't replace in comment lines, but that would just adds even more complication.)\r\n \r\n> [c9aa766](https://github.com/apache/freemarker/commit/c9aa766978359232410aabb8808c3b1e2faa182a) : I decided to NOT remove the `buildTimestamp` for now, because removal made some testcases fail and the buildtimestamp is also referenced in code (Version.java). I wanted to avoid too many changes for this PR here for now, before having a discussion about it.\r\n\r\nI say, we just keep it in the `Version` API, but mark it as deprecated, and always return `null`. (It was documented that it can return `null`, and it's quite unlikely that anyone even calls that method, and also fails on `null`.) That's the price of  reproducible builds. The JUnit tests has to be adjusted for this. And all these change belongs to this PR of course.\r\n\r\n> `After 3 years of work on Reproducible Builds, it has been found more useful as an internal file format: Reproducible Central and its .buildspec format is more what we need to check that Reproducible Builds results has been achieved. .buildinfo just records a build, be it reproducible or not. `\r\n> \r\n> So I don't really know how to proceed. My gut feeling is that we could keep it like it is now. We could just explain e.g. in the README which JDK you need for a reproducible build (and make a recommendation) and then it is up to the developer bringing it's machine to this state.\r\n\r\nIronically, we did have the exact JDK version in the META-INF of `freemarker.jar`, but now that was removed because of reproducible builds, which makes it harder to actually reproduce the build for someone else. Anyway... We could put this information automatically into the source artifact (that one we publish to Maven Central, and also into the source release), and the we can tell people to look for the information there, if they need to reproduce the build, and it didn't match at first attempt.\r\n \r\n> > `gradlew build`, and then see in `build/distributions`.\r\n> \r\n> Oh, so simple..

(If you have `gpg` installed anyway, that's the easiest.) Please check the included `gradle.properties` to set that up.

Although it's not needed, it seems like it may be less surprising if it works the same (perhaps fewer support questions). It would also provide a mechanism for people who are desperate to avoid whitespace.  \r\n_**Note**: If we made that change, we would need to decide the behavior of `continue` , due to its surprising legacy handling with `case`._\r\n\r\nExample trying to avoid whitespace:\r\n```freemarker\r\n<#switch animal.size>\r\n  <#on \"tiny\", \"small\">This will be processed if it is small<#break>\r\n  <#on \"medium\">This will be processed if it is medium<#break>\r\n  <#default>This will be processed if it is neither<#break>\r\n</#switch>\r\n```\r\nCounter-argument example instead using `t` (using `rt` seems to lead to slightly different results):\r\n```freemarker\r\n<#switch animal.size>\r\n  <#on \"tiny\", \"small\">This will be processed if it is small<#t>\r\n  <#on \"medium\">This will be processed if it is medium<#t>\r\n  <#default>This will be processed if it is neither<#t>\r\n</#switch>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is more a request for opinion than me making a decision. The motivation behind this directive was to give us a `switch` which isn't deprecated due to fall-through, but other than that, additional complications seem unnecessary. I might have a different opinion if we weren't reusing the `switch` directive.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/2161626816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/comments/2163287560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/freemarker/pull/106#issuecomment-2163287560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/freemarker/issues/106","id":2163287560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAn9g0s6A8SYI","user":{"login":"ddekany","id":342341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany","html_url":"https://github.com/ddekany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddekany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-12T15:10:08Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T15:10:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`<#t>` expresses the intent much better than `#break`.

After that, all the long existing missing value operators are applicable (see: https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_template_exp.html#dgui_template_exp_missing) . Also, that targets the root of the problem, which is that you really just want either a `null`, or a non-blank `String`, but because of some technical mess in a layer out of your control, both variants can come.\r\n\r\nAs of `s?is_empty`, check `s?has_content`. Maybe there's an overlap. (Also according the above, the question can be if you want to normalize a `\"  \"` to `null`, or only a 0-length string.)\r\n\r\nAs of `s?trim?length == 0`, note that if `s` is `null`, that's actually an error, so that wouldn't even work.
