The patch implementation was added to the ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao to allow updates to fields other than `alert` and `status` which require special handling and have dedicated endpoints\r\n- a `getAllLatest` implementation was added to the HBaseDao along with an integration test\r\n- a bug was discovered where the number of search results returned defaults to 10 meaning changes to alerts are only propagated to the first 10 meta alerts and vice-versa.  This was corrected in the ElasticsearchDao.searchByGuids by explicitly setting the size and fixed in the alert/meta alert lookup queries by paging through all the results if necessary.  A test was added to the integration test to catch this case in the future.\r\n\r\nI feel like this PR is in pretty good shape from a functional perspective.

latest commit fixes the bug in the previous comment.  The root cause was that HBaseDao.getAllLatest was not properly returning the sensor type and causing subsequent updates in Elasticsearch to fail.  The solution was simple:  look up the sensor type from the document and add it to the return Document.  I added a constant for this field (essentially a copy of ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao.SOURCE_TYPE) to the HBaseDao in anticipation of the ES 5 upgrade where it will no longer be required to change .'s to :'s.  At that point we can just change the constant to Constants.SENSOR_TYPE and it should continue to function.  \r\n\r\nThere are a couple other solutions to this problem that I can think of:\r\n- change the getAllLatest interface to include guid/sensorType mappings instead of separate guid and sensorType lists\r\n- add a column family to store the sensor type\r\n- other more complicated ways of getting the correct sensor type field name\r\n\r\nI felt this temporary constant was the simplest but feel free to give opinions on other options.  I also update the HBaseDaoIntegrationTest to expect this field to be returned.\r\n\r\nThe PR description has been updated to reflect the various interface changes and new testing procedure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/344089276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/344096600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/824#issuecomment-344096600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/824","id":344096600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDA5NjYwMA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-13T23:41:54Z","updated_at":"2017-11-13T23:41:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

We are now just excluding the \"metaalert\" sensor type from group by queries.\r\n\r\nRefactoring the HBaseDao was more involved.  One of the side effects of storing the sensorType in the row key is that now we require a map of guids to sensorTypes for an IndexDao.getAllLatest call.  These means the IndexDao.getAllLatest interface needed to change.  It made sense to just create a standard interface that can be used for looking up records since it is used in many different places and can be confusing as to what is needed to perform an operation on a document.  So this PR introduces a GetRequest that has the following structure:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"guid\": \"some guid\",\r\n  \"sensorType\" : \" some sensor type\",\r\n  \"index\": \"some optional index, not required\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince now keep the sensorType in the row key it is required for a look up.  HBase still doesn't have any concept of an index so that is kept optional.  In the ElasticsearchDao this is handled by using the index of a GetRequest if present or looking it up in Elasticsearch if not.  Now it should be clear what is needed to get a document since the interface is more consistent across that DAO methods.\r\n\r\nBecause of the GetRequest change the testing process and REST interface has changed slightly.  The PR description has been updated to reflect the changes.  I am still planning on doing a fresh vagrant build but this should be ready for testing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/344434720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/344459396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-344459396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/840","id":344459396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDQ1OTM5Ng==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T01:46:00Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T01:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"6.0 was released, should we consider going to that while we are at it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/344459396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/344460644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-344460644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/840","id":344460644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDQ2MDY0NA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-15T01:53:06Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T01:53:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was looking at that today as well, and I think that should be a follow-on\nconsidering how large the change is moving from 2.x to 5.x.

During deployment it has to reboot the VM to pickup new kernel options.  Sometimes Ansible fails to wait long enough for the reboot.  If this error does happen, running `vagrant provision` it will continue the progress.  That is what I did during my testing.  \r\n\r\nI am not sure exactly what the problem is, but the same condition occurs in master.  I would call this a pre-existing condition that we can handle with a separate PR.  \r\n\r\nOf course that is just my opinion and you or others may feel differently.
