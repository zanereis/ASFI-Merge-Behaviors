Hi all. This PR is still in progress actually. In this PR, first, if we do not set the 'limit', it will fetch as large as it can, it may cause the problem of Memory Explosion. Second, the sequence of fetch data is not in order, I think it violates the purpose of 'offset' and 'limit' field because we can find what we want by SHOW TIMESERIES OFFSET ? LIMIT ?.\r\n> I will fix it later and after the IT for cluster merged, I will add the test case of this part, thanks!\r\n\r\nping, you can add IT tests
