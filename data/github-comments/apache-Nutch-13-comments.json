The indexer-csv is not among the plugins activated by default.

That explains why you need to override the property `plugin.includes` if you want to use indexer-csv. You can do this in the command-line (`-D...`) or in your nutch-site.xml, see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTCH/NutchTutorial#NutchTutorial-Customizeyourcrawlproperties","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/2265008491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/comments/2347394534","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nutch/pull/824#issuecomment-2347394534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/824","id":2347394534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmIs6L6mXm","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-12T23:14:46Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T23:14:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 @sebastian-nagel applied and tested against `master`.
