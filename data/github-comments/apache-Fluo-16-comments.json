Could classes be loaded from HDFS directly using Accumulo's VFS classloader?\r\n\r\nYes. One possible way to do this would be to run `fluo config -a <app>` and grep for the property `fluo.observer.jars.url`. Its also possible to obtain this property via the Java API using `FluoAdmin.getApplicationConfig()`.  Then the VFS classloader could be configured to use this.  \r\n\r\nFluo is not currently using the VFS classloader for itself though.  Currently its not doing anything with classloaders and relying on the launch scripts to setup its classpath.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/408864422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/409228633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/466#issuecomment-409228633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/466","id":409228633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTIyODYzMw==","user":{"login":"cjmctague","id":20524292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI0Mjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20524292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague","html_url":"https://github.com/cjmctague","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjmctague/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T13:52:58Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T13:52:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updating

Looking inside `get(Collection<RowColumn> rowColumns)` there is a `ParallelSnapshotScanner`, I wonder if this could be used.  Create a parallel snapshot scanner and then read all the data from it.  Can pass `locksSeen` to the constructor of `ParallelSnapshotScanner`.\r\n\r\n> Another option would be something like the following, which just runs all the getImpl call concurrently.\r\n\r\nI am wary of using `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` for operations that do I/O because it runs in a JVM wide shared thread pool.  If the Fluo client library does this it could impact user code that is also using `runAsync()`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/544969648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/544989215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1079#issuecomment-544989215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1079","id":544989215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDk4OTIxNQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T14:26:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T14:26:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I built locally with JDK8 and JDK11 w/ no problems.

How do we make this determination? I haven't really given this much thought yet. Might be something to consider as part of a separate issue/PR.\n- There doesn't seem to be a lot of tests in the command module.

If I've missed any or if there are other issues please let me know. I'm going to work on adding tests and doing some functional testing. It might take a little while because I need to figure out the best way to test all the commands.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of potential follow up issues though that I've come across\r\n\r\n1. Investigate possible ways of condensing the [fluo script](https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1083/files#diff-9085d61b756f1527aae51ea144142951).\r\nAfter this change the [fluo script](https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1083/files#diff-9085d61b756f1527aae51ea144142951) has become pretty repetitive, there may be some ways of condensing it.\r\n2. Figure out solution for printing to logger vs `System.out`. \r\nSome commands print to `System.out` while others log to a Logger\r\n3. Make commands more friendly to be used outside of CLI.\r\n(This may be very related to number 2). Because `execute` returns `void`, the caller doesn't get much information from the commands, just whether it was successful or if there was an Exception. For example `FluoList` is pretty useless outside of the CLI right now, it just prints the running applications to `System.out`. Issues like #670 could benefit from being able to use the info from `FluoList`. One possible solution would be to move the functionality to another method like `public T list()` where `T` was some type that had the relevant information for listing applications. Then `execute()` could call `list()` and print the information to `System.out`. The web app mentioned in #670  could just call `list()` directly. The other commands would each have to be looked at individually.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/566860671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/567068406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/1083#issuecomment-567068406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/1083","id":567068406,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzA2ODQwNg==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-18T15:00:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T15:00:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So I'm pretty happy with the current status of this PR and I think I've addressed all the comments.\r\n\r\nI think this is in really good shape.

I usually use the Squash and Merge button on github (there is a drop down arrow beside the Create a Merge Commit button) when there are no merge conflcts.  Be careful with the Squash and merge button though.  In the past it failed for me and when it did a retry button showed up.
