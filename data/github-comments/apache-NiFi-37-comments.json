This was necessary to solve the HBase + Phoenix problem, but in many other cases it may be acceptable to just make a new InstanceClassLoader with a parent of the NAR ClassLoader.\n\nSo I started working on a change where every single processor, cs, reporting task will get an InstanceClassLoader and by default it will be empty and have a parent of the NAR ClassLoader. Only components with the @RequiresInstanceClassLoading will force a full copy of the resources. \n\nThis lets the HBaseControllerService use @RequiresInstanceClassLoading, and other components can still have properties that modify the classpath without making full copies.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257964654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/257981597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1166#issuecomment-257981597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1166","id":257981597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Nzk4MTU5Nw==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-02T20:01:08Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T20:01:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"duh...

Unfortunately I had already rebased my branch before you had started reviewing, so i ended up having to force push, but I left it as two commits where the first one has the stuff you already looked at, and the second commit has changes after that.\n\nI think the remaining discussion point is mostly around how restrictive we get regarding what happens when one or more resources can't be found. I understand the point about what happens if something that is necessary can't be loaded, but I also want to give flexibility to the developers using this feature. There may be cases where someone wants to provide a couple of directories that are common locations for a given library, and if found then load whatever is found, but if not then maybe they don't care. One option might be to provide a validator that uses ClassLoader.getURLsforClasspath to validate everything resolves, and then document that this is available, but not enforce that it is always used.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/258241936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/258242484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1156#issuecomment-258242484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1156","id":258242484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODI0MjQ4NA==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-03T19:02:58Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T19:02:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende thanks, will start looking\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/258242484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/258326217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/587#issuecomment-258326217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/587","id":258326217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODMyNjIxNw==","user":{"login":"aoyawale","id":20134928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTM0OTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20134928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale","html_url":"https://github.com/aoyawale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aoyawale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-04T01:58:29Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T01:58:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm going to close this pull request since the documentation changed a lot and the changes added here are not needed anymore.

I appreciate these projects providing WebSocket support for NiFi, and wanted to merge the capability to Apache NiFi code base. I referred these existing projects, and add few functionalities and Unit Test codes.\n\nFeatures:\n- As a WebSocket client to connect a remote WebSocket server\n- As a WebSocket server to receive connection from remote WebSocket clients\n- Receive and send text messages as well as binary messages\n- Secure communication (using SslContextService) is supported\n\nIt may look more complex, so for the description purpose, I wrote a blog post about how it works, and how it's designed. Please check this post as well, [NiFi WebSocket Support](http://ijokarumawak.github.io/nifi/2016/11/04/nifi-websocket/).\n\nAny comment or advice would be appreciated, thanks in

I think this is valuable functionality but I'm currently having some issues with it.\n\nI'm currently testing the merge against Oracle express 11g and am having some problems.\n\nIt's generating the following SQL that Oracle doesn't like:\n\n```\nMERGE VIOLATIONS target_t \nUSING VALUES (?,?) \nAS source_t (SUMMONS_NUMBER,PLATE) \nON target_t.SUMMONS_NUMBER = source_t.SUMMONS_NUMBER \nWHEN MATCHED THEN \nUPDATE SET PLATE = source_t.PLATE \nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN \nINSERT (SUMMONS_NUMBER,PLATE) \nVALUES (source_t.SUMMONS_NUMBER,source_t.PLATE) \n;\n```\n\nOracle is complaining that it is missing an INTO keyword after the MERGE.\n\nIf I add that manually, it then complains of an invalid table name.  I suspect this is due to the \"USING VALUES\" portion of the query which [doesn't appear to be standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_%28SQL%29).\n\nIf each database is going to require different SQL for this operation, it may warrant its own processor where we can contain all of that custom logic per database, possibly with the [DatabaseAdapter interface](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/db/DatabaseAdapter.java) (@mattyb149 may have some thoughts around that).\n\nIf you'd like to repro my tests, here is a link to the [Oracle docker image](https://github.com/brosander/dev-dockerfiles/tree/master/sample-data/nyc_traffic_violations/oracle-xe-11g) and here is one to [my flow.xml.gz](https://blog.rosander.ninja/attachments/random/2016/11/08/flow.xml.gz) and [test.json file](https://blog.rosander.ninja/attachments/random/2016/11/08/test.json).\n\nThanks,\nBryan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/259215004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/259220125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/952#issuecomment-259220125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/952","id":259220125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTIyMDEyNQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T18:34:22Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T18:34:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's a real bummer that an ANSI \"standard\" such as MERGE is done differently by so many databases :( If there isn't an application of the standard MERGE syntax that applies to many databases (or the functionality is desired for DBs that don't support the standard), then I like Bryan's suggestion of using the DatabaseAdapter interface. We could add a method such as getMergeStatement() to DatabaseAdapter, with no-op (or exception-throwing) default implementation (on the interface or the subclasses), then implement for Oracle (which has a DatabaseAdapter already) and add a TeradataDatabaseAdapter subclass to implement their version of the syntax. Thoughts?\n\nAlso, it sounds like the community is gearing up for a 1.1.0 release soon, do you think you'd have any updates ready in the near-term? If not (which is totally fine btw), could we push the Fix Version for the Jira to 1.2.0?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/259220125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/259227840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1187#issuecomment-259227840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1187","id":259227840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTIyNzg0MA==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-08T19:03:21Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T19:03:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing.

I was just running it and had some follow-up questions. It looks as though the proposed changes are conditionally validating the underlying Processor when it is stopped. However, other validation about the Processor (specifically regarding the incoming and outgoing connections) is still happening. Comments about these changes are outlined below according to the modified method.\n\n**isValid**\n\nisValid is used throughout the application to check processor state usually prior to performing some action or transitioning to some state. I believe in this method we still need to run all Processor validation logic to ensure we know if it's valid when invoking it.\n\nWhen looking into the context of the isValid usage, it does appear that we can make some changes when getting the Processor status [1]. By checking if the scheduled state is running prior to checking the processor validity aligns with the proposed solution and should help reduce the expense of the status calls identified in the JIRA.\n\n**getValidationErrors**\n\nRegardless of whether the UI is rendering the validation results, they are still being returned from the Rest Api. I'm wondering if returning a portion of the validation errors when the Processor is not stopped is confusing. Would it be more clear if we moved the rest of the validation inside of the conditional as well? Meaning, when the Processor is not stopped, this method would return an empty Collection. When the Processor is stopped, this method would run all Processor validation.  \n\n**Additional Comment**\n\nShould these changes also be applied to Ports, Reporting Tasks, and Controller Services (if disabled)? I understand that not all of these components cause lengthy validation times, but I'm trying to consider it from a consistency perspective from a client of the Rest Api. If a Processor only returns validation errors when it is stopped, I believe this is how all components should work too.\n\n[1]

Also I was able to apply the styles you suggested in the Jira. Be aware, however, there is an issue with the spacing you outlined in the Jira. The issue is that the ellipsis plugin requires the width and height of the element be set in 'px'. With the responsive nature of the dialogs I do not believe we can support these descriptions as responsive divs that would be necessary to fulfill said spacing (i.e. to support a responsive description area div we would need to apply position:absolute). This will require a much larger effort and as the original ask for NIFI-2898 was to restore the 0.x ellipsis functionality I think we could consider the spacing you outlined as part of a follow on Jira that will support the scrollable description areas (as discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-2898).
