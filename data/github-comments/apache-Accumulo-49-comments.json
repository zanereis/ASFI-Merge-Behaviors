When adding a project to an issue/PR, the automation sets it to `To do`; normally, it would automatically move to `Done` when it is closed.\r\n\r\nHowever, since I added the project to the issue after it was already closed, it did not transition to `Done` automatically, and needed to be manually moved to `Done` in the project. Normally I do this second step immediately. For whatever reason, that didn't happen this time (either because of AJAX timeout in GitHub UI or because I simply forgot this time).\r\n\r\nIn future, it is best if everybody helps organize issues, by adding the version prior to it being closed, or manually marking it done immediately following closing it, rather than rely on me to sweep in and add the version later. If I am the only one doing this, some will inevitably slip through the cracks. Other committers can help by adding projects themselves, and properly marking them as `Done` as needed (or, if an issue is closed as `Won't fix` or similar, then removing it from the project).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/630111462/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/630876823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1607#issuecomment-630876823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1607","id":630876823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDg3NjgyMw==","user":{"login":"ivakegg","id":347158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/347158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg","html_url":"https://github.com/ivakegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivakegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-19T14:57:55Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T14:59:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was a little scared to do that because of the configuration comparison mechanism that tries to ensure configurations are consistent across hosts.

To easily do the check we need `Map<File, List<Range>>`. \r\n\r\nAnother option if that does not work is when Range.TABLE is seen AND maxTablets > 0, then we actually try to resolve the range to tablets.   However this kinda defeats the purpose of Range.TABLE as it is for the case when user has the most knowledge and Accumulo can do the least work in the fastest manner.\r\n\r\nNot sure what is best, just trying to think through the options.  Need to look at the code some more too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/637796852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/637899981","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1614#issuecomment-637899981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1614","id":637899981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNzg5OTk4MQ==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T01:28:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T01:28:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@milleruntime the following branch has a change I was experimenting with for adding a server side check... its the top commit\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/keith-turner/accumulo/tree/accumulo-1614","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/637899981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/638415810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1620#issuecomment-638415810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1620","id":638415810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODQxNTgxMA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-03T19:33:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T19:33:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a possibly related change for import table #1569\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to have a VolumeManager.bulkRename() method for renaming lots of files.

One possible way to do this is to only check when a client does the startUpdate() RPC.  If startUpdate() successfully increments the counter, then this is recorded on the server side write session and the client can call applytUpdate() and closeUpdate() w/o the checks happening.  If the startUpdate() does not increment the counter, then it throws a special exception indicating no resources.  When a write session is deleted on the server side, the counter is decremented.\r\n\r\nOn the client side, when an exception is seen indicating no resources it can do exponential back off up to the configurable client side timeout.  The batch writer already has a configurable timeout, so this would work nicely with that w/o any API changes.\r\n\r\nI think checking in the startUpdate() RPC instead of the applyUpdate() RPC is better for throughput.  When server side resources are under strain, the client will not even bother sending an overburdened tserver data when the check is done in startUpdate().

I have a branch where I basically combined the features of both that I will put a pull request up soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/646617405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/646698597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1634#issuecomment-646698597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1634","id":646698597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjY5ODU5Nw==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-19T15:29:49Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T15:29:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cradal It looks like you have unrelated formatting changes included in this PR.

If a user processes a data set and generates multiple tables, say data, metrics and errors - the ideal case would be that there are no errors (so an empty table).  Rather than handling the logic of if the table does not exist, there must be no errors, it was simpler for their query / scan logic to have the empty table.
