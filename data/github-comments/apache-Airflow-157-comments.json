I do agree that we should always have proper SSL certificates. But this feature may be quite necessary when\r\n- if we want to use a different CA cert bundle than the one used by `botocore` (argument `verify` can be either boolean or string. When it's string, it can be path/to/cert/bundle.pem).\r\n- for my own case, my infra team didn't set proper SSL for the on-prem UAT S3. Before they set it up for me, I have to use `--no-verify-ssl`, i.e. put `verify` as `False`. I believe I'm not the only one who have this sort of issue.\r\n\r\nRegarding default value: In `boto3`, default value of `verify` is `None`, and actually it's equivalent to `True` here (please refer to [boto3 session reference](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/core/session.html)). when we run \r\n```\r\nsession.client(client_type, endpoint_url=endpoint_url)\r\n```\r\nit's equivalent to\r\n```\r\nsession.client(client_type, endpoint_url=endpoint_url, verify=None)\r\n``` \r\nand SSL certificates would be verified.\r\nTo keep consistent with `boto3`, I also put `None` as default value here.\r\n\r\nHope this clarifies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/414131118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/414131815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3758#issuecomment-414131815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3758","id":414131815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDEzMTgxNQ==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-19T14:34:14Z","updated_at":"2018-08-19T14:34:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Did

S3 API and LDAP protocol support communication with and without SSL. Organisations who want to disable insecure connection will generally block the port that allows insecure communication (LDAP 389 port). Additionally, we have development environments where users want to test tools without having to deal with things like TLS and Kerberos.\r\n\r\nThe other point is when we are in an on-premise environment using tools like Minio or IBM Cloud Object Store, we need to be able to pass certs that aren't the default AWS certificates. This is a requirement for running Airflow securely in an on-premise cloud.\r\n\r\nI would suggest defaulting to SSL enabled but allow the opportunity for users to disable it if required. As the AWS CLI does, an warning could be thrown telling users that noSSL is an insecure option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/414529083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/414547304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3776#issuecomment-414547304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3776","id":414547304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDU0NzMwNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T04:37:34Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T04:38:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
