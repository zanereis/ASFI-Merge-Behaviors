Apart from that, everything in `initdb` is optional - airflow will operate fine with only ever running `upgradedb`. We have been running in prod since 1.8.2 only having done `upgradedb` and nothing has broken or missing (other than no sample charts or connections)\r\n\r\nI have no idea where KnowEvent(Type) is actually used - there are very few references to it in the rest of the code base that I could see other the creation there, and a view. Nothing ever seems to use it for anything else.... Maybe a candidate for dropping, though worth checking with @mistercrunch or someone else (still?) at AirBnB.\r\n\r\nPre-loading of the DAG table didn't used to be required as starting the scheduler would do this job too, but on quick testing I'm not sure that's the case anymore.\r\n\r\nHmm, the RBAC change should possibly be converted to be an actual Alembic migration, or at the very least done via upgradedb not just initdb!\r\n\r\nI have somewhat hijacked this issue though. Oops.\r\n\r\nHaving written al that I'm not sure the way forward either.\r\n\r\nRBAC and KET should probably be in upgradedb. It might be worth merging them in to a single command behind a flag `airflow initdb --with-examples` which is more obvious/delibarate than having to know that `upgradedb` exists when all the tutorials just talk about initdb.

The intent is that, for example, an AWS KMS Hook could be added in the future (similar to `GcpKmsHook` now) following the `KmsApiHook` interface (in addition to supporting any AWS-specific features), and then add it to the list of supported KMSs in `get_kms_hook` (`models.py`, Line 883 in this PR). You should then be able to choose between AWS or GCP KMS on a per-connection basis. \r\n\r\nThe reason the `kms_*` fields are not stored as part of the `extra` field is so that you can encrypt *any* connection via KMS managed credentials (not just Google connections).
