My branch‚Äòs version is 2.0.5-release and I have checked the code is same with above from the compiled jar . Could you have a look at here, please. @JinyLeeChina\r\n\r\nI found the reason! Firstly, the NPE cause by `long` can't be null. Maybe  it should replaced by `Long`. \r\nWhen the task A was depended by a sub process 's task B, task A rename to A1, or be deleted. And the task B 's depend item list wouldn't update, then cause the result that can't find the `depTasks`.\r\nIt would be ok with fix the dependent task by manual.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136785101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136811573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10142#issuecomment-1136811573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10142","id":1136811573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Dwl41","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T06:42:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T06:42:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is expected behavior, just like temporarily overwriting the parameter with use in.
