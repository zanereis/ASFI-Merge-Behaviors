docker-compose to start dolphonescheduler, use image apache/dolphinscheduler:2.0.4, and create a workflow like image above and get task definition via api queryTaskDefinitionByCode   dolphinscheduler/projects/{projectCode}/task-definition/{code}.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\n2.0.5\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a

Firstly, the NPE cause by `long` can't be null. Maybe  it should replaced by `Long`. \r\nWhen the task A was depended by a sub process 's task B, task A rename to A1, or be deleted. And the task B 's depend item list wouldn't update, then cause the result that can't find the `depTasks`.\r\nIt would be ok with fix the dependent task by manual.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136785101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136811573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10142#issuecomment-1136811573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10142","id":1136811573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Dwl41","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T06:42:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T06:42:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is expected behavior, just like temporarily overwriting the parameter with use in.

I think we should open a discussion before adding this.\r\n\r\nYou are right, because it is better to eliminate the dependency of the code in the program on the modules that are not open inside java, but the problem now is that there is such a dependency in the code, and it will cause the program to fail to compile. I think you guys can remove my pr after refactoring the code improvement, but for now I think this pr is necessary","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136833447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136838101","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10239#issuecomment-1136838101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10239","id":1136838101,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5DwsXV","user":{"login":"SbloodyS","id":17822915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIyOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17822915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS","html_url":"https://github.com/SbloodyS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SbloodyS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T06:58:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T06:58:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kezhenxu94 PTAL","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136838101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1136846928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10239#issuecomment-1136846928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10239","id":1136846928,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5DwuhQ","user":{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T07:02:50Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T07:02:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@106umao hi thanks for doing this, since the patch doesn't require developers' additional changes in their development process I'm OK to add this.\r\n\r\nBut did you test the compiled codes can run correctly at runtime?
