It seems the direct use of the Database is all wrapped in a JSON-related file object, which kind of confuses me, would you mind providing a brief explanation of the class structure somewhere?\r\n\r\nHey thanks @mbrookhart for asking! Let's focus on the database API and ignore the workload registry part (which will be removed according to previous discussion with Cody in this thread).\r\n\r\n* The base abstract class is `Database`, which has 4 pure virtual methods: `commit_workload`, `commit_tuning_record`, `get_top_k`, `size`\r\n* The system interacts with any subclass of `Database` by calling these 4 methods\r\n* To implement a concrete subclass of `Database`: in pure C++, we can just inherit Database and do so; in pure python, we provide `PyDatabase` to inherit from, where we plays some tricks, so that everything can be implemented in pure python\r\n* `JSONFile` is a simple default implementation of `Database` for open source\r\n* Developers can provide other implementations too by inheriting `Database` or `PyDatabase`, for example, database backed by SQLite, etc, as long as the class implements the 4 methods","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/926207149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/926211415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9061#issuecomment-926211415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9061","id":926211415,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43NN1X","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-23T22:33:35Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T22:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The first three points and the last one make sense, but I think I'm a little confused by `JSONFile` being the default user-facing database.
