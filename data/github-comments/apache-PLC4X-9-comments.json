If the refactoring of code is extensive and can not forseen it is against the basic principle of Community over Code. If you can convince the community on the mailing list to accept your PR then it would work. To be realistic.... the changes are too big and it would be hard to get a majority with this amount of changes. So we like to pull in you really nice changes in a slower pace and decouple it by looking first and the non-breaking elements and for the string topic you already saw the dicussion on the mailing list. I hope that helps you to understand a little better as we are aiming to have a community around the code and a stable framework where developers are comfortable on supporting and evolving PLC4X.

Is the project active?\r\n- No this project is not active and has not been started yet. But we as PLC4X Community are happy to support developers aiming to implement.\r\n> * [x]  If the TypeScript version isn't active, is there any plans to start it? How can one contribute to it either in terms of time or money?\r\n- For the time beeing mainly developer willing to put time into it and get TypeScript started as a supported language.\r\n> * [x]  Is the [Help Wanted](https://github.com/apache/plc4x/wiki/Help-Wanted) Wiki still up to date?\r\n- Yes it it is still up to date - We are currently investigating into Multiconnection support in a more generic way. We started some specific one in Java for S7 protocol. Check-out our mailing list as well where we discuss these kind of things.\r\n> \r\n> * [x]  Also, planning to use PLC4x in some industrial applications and confused between deciding PLC4Java v/s PLC4Go. Any suggestions which one is more mature or are they at par?\r\n- For Industrial applications we are currently recommending to use PLC4Java as this is the most mature one. PLC4Go is quite close but not at par (especially for S7, but we are working on it -> See Multiconnection discussion)\r\n> * [x]   Is the following [table](https://plc4x.apache.org/users/protocols/index.html) up to date?\r\n- Yes and we have another one on our confluence site: [Drivers and their Transports/Protocols](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=255069989)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1546828811/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/1546867512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/issues/615#issuecomment-1546867512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/615","id":1546867512,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBtifa85cM1M4","user":{"login":"maneetgoyal","id":25290212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjkwMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25290212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal","html_url":"https://github.com/maneetgoyal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maneetgoyal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-14T10:40:27Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T10:40:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\r\n
