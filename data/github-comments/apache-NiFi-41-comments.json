Difference between RAW and HTTP protocol for receiving data.\r\n\r\n    RAW resolves hostname from socket, while HTTP does so from HTTP request. Due to this difference, RAW uses hostname as `s2s.host` attribute like `localhost`, while HTTP set `127.0.0.1`. I think this may be difficult when users define routing rules in downstream flow. I wonder if it can produce the same value, hostname or ip address for both transport protocol.\r\n\r\n2. Unknown hostname and port due to illegal URL\r\n\r\n    As discussed in the [previous PR](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1307#issuecomment-266442657),  I got 'unknown' hostname and port with Docker containers. While this can be handled as a corner case since it's not allowed by the URL specification, I think it'd be better if we can be lenient here to support Docker environment. I confirmed provenance event also failed to resolve hostname and produced provenance details with `null` hostname.\r\n\r\n    I think this can be improved by changing Peer's constructor. It parses peerUrl then use its hostname and port, but the same information should be retrieved from PeerDescriptor without parsing the URL. Currently, SocketRemoteSiteListener uses server's hostname and port for PeerDescription, but it seems it's not correct, those should be client's.\r\n\r\nPlease let me dig deeper comments above. Will update soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267924104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/267987085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1322#issuecomment-267987085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1322","id":267987085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzk4NzA4NQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-19T15:08:11Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T15:08:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @scottyaslan!

I reconsidered about s2s.address property, and by focusing only on the downstream flow, I think it probably doesn't matter whether the flow file came into the flow either by pulling or receiving it.\r\n\r\nIf one needs to distinguish the direction in downstream flow, they can do so by adding UpdateAttribute to add whatever context they need. I think it's better to keep the number of attributes that NiFi framework create automatically at minimum. Removing feature from framework may be harder than adding it.\r\n\r\nSo, I will keep the attribute names as they are now. Will update the PR with additional unit tests later.

That button is present based on the users permission to modify the template [1]. Looking at the screenshot, the button has been added to the DOM so the permissions to the template are correct. I believe the button has just wrapped to the next line. Now the question is why has this happened.\r\n\r\nLet's try to eliminate one other simple possibility first. The templates page is loaded via an iframe. This can sometimes cause caching issues. Resources are cached according to URL so if you access the instance differently (different scheme, host, or port) when bypassing the proxy, this may be what's happening. Opening the templates page directly (outside of the iframe) will allow you to clear the cache. This doesn't happen reliably when loading through an iframe.\r\n\r\nCan you try popping the page out by clicking the arrow button next to the close 'X' in the upper right-hand corner of the shell? Once the page is in it's own page/tab can you clear the cache or do a hard refresh to see if that makes a difference?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui/src/main/webapp/js/nf/templates/nf-templates-table.js#L265","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/268814187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/268826112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1354#issuecomment-268826112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1354","id":268826112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODgyNjExMg==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-22T15:43:46Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T15:43:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/268826112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/268826368","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1342#issuecomment-268826368","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1342","id":268826368,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODgyNjM2OA==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-22T15:45:01Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T15:45:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the issue was that I had left nifi.remote.input.host blank on both instances.

To reference an internet URL somewhat breaks the idea that the build system works of of package names/versions. Both maven and the OS (alpine, centos, etc.) reference dependencies by name/version only. If we can avoid this, we also improve portability of the builds and prevent issues when the upstream HTTP url of the referenced built nifi changes, goes down, or is inaccessible from the build environment.\r\n\r\nWhat the others say about the self-referencing version makes sense, too.\r\n\r\nBasically, if building the image were another build stage, then the version of the docker image produced would just be in sync with the source tree as a whole. E.g. you build a 1.1.0 release, and the java build/package produces a 1.1.0 binary, then the final docker packaging stage produces a 1.1.0 image.\r\n\r\nThe docker-maven-plugin that @ddewaele

My original thought was that this would be a more singular build that we as a community release for end users to download. However from this discussion it seems like most people might be more interested in the build process approach.\r\n\r\nIn that case it should be pretty simple to do a little maven magic to inject the current version into the Dockerfile and use the docker-maven-plugin. \r\n\r\nI do believe this might make maintenance on older Docker images a little harder since they would be tightly coupled to a release/branch however. Does anyone more seasoned than myself have ideas about how to make that process easier?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270380707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270382134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1372#issuecomment-270382134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1372","id":270382134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM4MjEzNA==","user":{"login":"ai-christianson","id":24681233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgxMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24681233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson","html_url":"https://github.com/ai-christianson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ai-christianson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T14:25:47Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T14:26:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jdye64 If we do end up going the route of injecting the build #, Dockerfile ARG statements might be the way to go. The docker-maven-plugin would be the place to set the arg, if that plugin supports it. Unsure if they do.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of image maintenance are you concerned with? Are you talking about going back and releasing minor releases? In my experience with docker, the way it would work is with image tags. E.g. the \"centos7\" tag of the official \"centos\" image tracks the 7.x release. This would be analogous to a \"nifi1.0.x\" or \"nifi-1.1.x\" tag, or however it would best be named. In that arrangement, it would come down to compatibility between versions. If I'm running a production release of nifi 1.1.x, I want to get the latest bugfixes/patches when I do a docker pull, but I do not want to be upgraded to an incompatible version, i.e. 1.2.x.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/270382134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
