As demonstrated, which has big performance impact when conv2d is executed fast. Besides us, the community also report this thing too. https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/quantization-autotvm-performance-degradation-due-to-transpose-ops-when-nchw-layout-is-used/3561. I think we should support NHWC layout of spatial pack schedule in ARM CPU instead of inserting transpose op. Morever, @jackwish has investigated NHWC / NCHW layout on ARM CPU advantages / disadvantages internally. If we don't take NHWC layout, we can not get the best performance and beat QNNPACK. \r\n\r\nIn summary, we should support NHWC layout like here: https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/topi/python/topi/arm_cpu/bitserial_conv2d.py#L264 and it is not difficult and only need our minor work. Unified one NCHW sounds good but is not best in practical if we want to get the best performance (which is one key factor to let users use TVM or not).

seems that the normalisation of the quantisation parameters would be the same for a number of different operators. If that is the case, does it make sense to factor this out and maybe put this in a pass? That would avoid having to implement this for each operator.\r\nDo we know what the quantization parameters are at each point in the Relay graph?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520426953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520460898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3408#issuecomment-520460898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3408","id":520460898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDQ2MDg5OA==","user":{"login":"csarofeen","id":22205833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjA1ODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22205833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen","html_url":"https://github.com/csarofeen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csarofeen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T14:58:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T14:58:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like this got stuck, is there a way to retry the tests?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520460898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520475436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2623#issuecomment-520475436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2623","id":520475436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDQ3NTQzNg==","user":{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T15:33:26Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:33:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"# TVM Monthly -

But, equally important is portability, both across frameworks and HW devices. It is fine to be in a temporary stage where things are functional and not performant as compared to a stage where we are neither functional nor performant. Currently, we fall into latter bucket for TFLite models, which makes it harder to convince edge device vendors (who like TFLite) to try TVM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520481749/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520483503","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3746#issuecomment-520483503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3746","id":520483503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDQ4MzUwMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T15:52:24Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:52:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @weberlo !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520483503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520484397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3751#issuecomment-520484397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3751","id":520484397,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDQ4NDM5Nw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T15:54:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T15:54:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @cchung100m ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520484397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
