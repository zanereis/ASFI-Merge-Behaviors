If the retrying operation receives a session lost event as the error code, then the connection state manager will produce a phantom LOST event. I'm not quite sure how to reproduce the error code being a session lost, so I just injected it. The curator client does remains functional in this case. The issue I ran into is that we flip a switch in our ZK client code when it's in a LOST or SUSPENDED state and won't make any requests. Since, the LOST event being produced doesn't impact the actual state, there's never a reconnect event. So, to our client code it appears that the curator client is permanently in a LOST state, until for instance the session happens to time out.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604776315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604778757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1059#issuecomment-2604778757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1059","id":2604778757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3Nzg3NTc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T14:49:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:44:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p>I don't understand the description.

But I don't think it is normal, whether or not to send an event depends on whether or not PathChildrenCache.cacheData has the path.  Since StartMode.BUILD_INITIAL_CACHE has created the cacheData, in theory the history events will not be sent.  But now the problem is that when start, the CONNECTED state changes, and then the history events will be sent. This can be confusing, and the StartMode.BUILD_INITIAL_CACHE in version 2.7.1 is normal.</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">private</span> void handleStateChange(ConnectionState newState)\n{\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">switch</span> ( newState )\n    {\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">case</span> SUSPENDED:\n    {\nofferOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> EventOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span>, <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> PathChildrenCacheEvent(PathChildrenCacheEvent.Type.CONNECTION_SUSPENDED, <span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>)));\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">break</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">case</span> LOST:\n    {\nofferOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> EventOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span>, <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> PathChildrenCacheEvent(PathChildrenCacheEvent.Type.CONNECTION_LOST, <span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>)));\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">break</span>;\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">case</span> CONNECTED:\n    <span class=\"code-keyword\">case</span> RECONNECTED:\n    {\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">try</span>\n{\n    offerOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> RefreshOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span>, RefreshMode.FORCE_GET_DATA_AND_STAT));\n    offerOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> EventOperation(<span class=\"code-keyword\">this</span>, <span class=\"code-keyword\">new</span> PathChildrenCacheEvent(PathChildrenCacheEvent.Type.CONNECTION_RECONNECTED, <span class=\"code-keyword\">null</span>)));\n}\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">catch</span> ( Exception e )\n{\n    ThreadUtils.checkInterrupted(e);\n    handleException(e);\n}\n<span class=\"code-keyword\">break</span>;\n    }\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604778781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604778792","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/1059#issuecomment-2604778792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/1059","id":2604778792,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3Nzg3OTI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-16T14:34:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:44:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p>note: re-wording</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=honglun\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"honglun\">HonglunChen</a>  what is the bug here?
