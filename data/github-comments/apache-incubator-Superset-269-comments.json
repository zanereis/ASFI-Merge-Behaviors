I looked at the PR for this SIP and a few things came to mind:\r\n\r\nTo address the issue you raise in the docs where belonging to two departments results in zero rows (`WHERE dept = 1 AND dept = 2`), I propose changing the `Clause` field to JSON, putting each clause behind a key, which are later ORed together. Example: There are four RLS filters specified for a table: two for departments (\"Finance\", \"Risk\") and two for time history (\"30 days\", \"90 days\").\r\n\"Finance\" role:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"dept\": \"dept_id = 'Finance'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\"Risk\" role:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"dept\": \"dept_id = 'Risk'\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"30 days\" role:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"history\": \"report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"90 days\" role:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"history\": \"report_date >= current_timestamp() - 90\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if a user belonged to all four groups, this would result in the following WHERE clause:\r\n```sql\r\n((dept_id = 'Finance') OR (dept_id = 'Risk')) AND \r\n((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30) OR (report_date >= current_timestamp() - 90))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the user would see 90 days of history, and also all rows for Finance AND Risk.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it would be good to be able to define a default WHERE clause if a user doesn't belong to any of the specified groups.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/559954723/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/559961781","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8695#issuecomment-559961781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8695","id":559961781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTk2MTc4MQ==","user":{"login":"metaperl","id":21293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl","html_url":"https://github.com/metaperl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metaperl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-30T12:41:00Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T12:41:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Furthermore

I wanted to point that out in the docs for clarity, \r\nand viewed it as more of something the user should be aware of than as an issue.  I can definitely \r\nsee a certain use-case where it may not be ideal, but am of the mindset that it's better\r\nto show no data (which can be easily detected and fixed), should the user introduce a \r\nconflict in the filters, than to be overly permissive and allow a user to see data they otherwise\r\nshouldn't be able to see.  Should _that_ occur, it may not be readily apparent.\r\n\r\nI think everything you've mentioned can be mostly accomplished as-is, by taking a slightly \r\ndifferent approach to the role/filter composition.\r\n\r\n1.  Filters clauses can contain OR.  You could simply make a filter with the \r\nclause `dept_id = 'Finance' OR dept_id = 'Risk'` and assign it to a particular role.  Obviously \r\nthis is not ideal if you want to assign a user to more than one department by assigning them \r\ntwo roles.  What I'm not sure of is how much this needs to come up.  If someone has access to \r\nboth the `Finance` and the `Risk`, are they really in each department, or are they some \r\nhigher-up who should have greater access? The current method, I hope, seems analogous to superset's **Restricting access to a subset of data sources** recommendation.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to realize that there was a bug in my initial implementation - filters are now \r\nwrapped in parentheses in case one has an OR in it.\r\n\r\n2.  To reference the **Restricting access to a subset of data sources** again, it's recommended \r\nto assign a limited user to the gamma role, and to make a role giving them access to the \r\ndatasource in question.  In the case of creating a default filter, you could just assign a \r\nfilter to that role.  However, it is not exactly what you have in mind, since it wouldn't \r\nbe _overwritten_ by additional filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy worry is that we'd be increasing complexity, in the code, as well as in ease-of-understanding on the \r\nuser's part, for minimal gains.  However, it could be that I'm taking the wrong approach here.  \r\nIs this something others would find useful?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to eventually add (probably as a separate SIP?) arbitrary user attributes that \r\ncan then be referenced in the row level security filters.  But I'd want to talk to someone \r\nabout that, as I have many questions in that regard.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560004957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560006817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8703#issuecomment-560006817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8703","id":560006817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDAwNjgxNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-30T18:07:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T18:08:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8703?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#8703](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8703?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/b2633a51d43faaca74751349b96fc32784d4b377?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8703/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8703?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #8703   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   65.55%   65.55%           \n=======================================\n  Files         481      481           \n  Lines       24079    24079           \n  Branches     2763     2763           \n=======================================\n  Hits        15784    15784           \n  Misses       8115     8115           \n  Partials      180      180\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8703?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8703?src=pr&el=footer).

Think AD/LDAP in a corporate setting; not uncommon to belong to hundreds of groups. Regarding implementation, I would propose just adding a column \"role_based_filters\"  or similar to the tables table with the metadata:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dept\": {\r\n    \"default\": \"false\",\r\n    \"roles\": {\r\n      \"finance\": \"dept_id = 1\",\r\n      \"risk\": \"dept_id = 2\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"duration\": {\r\n    \"default\": \"report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1\",\r\n    \"roles\": {\r\n      \"finance\": \"report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, users that don't belong to any group would get a WHERE clause that returns zero rows due to the \"false\" clause (`SELECT col FROM table WHERE FALSE` -> no rows), and by default only the last days data would be available. If the user belongs to the \"risk\" Role, they would see only \"dept_id = 2\" for the last day (default clause for \"duration\"), whereas \"finance\" would see \"dept_id = 1\" for the last 30 days. Belonging to both would return data for both departments with 30 days of data.\r\n\r\nOne could later add the same column to the charts table, making it possible to introduce the same functionality on a per chart basis. With regards to the filter statements, I would propose using the same filter format that's currently used for `adhoc_filters`, which would enable us to leverage existing React components that allow for a much more user friendly means to add filters. To introduce the functionality, I would break the SIP into two parts; first introducing the backend functionality, i.e. adding the new column to table, making it possible to edit the filters by poking at the table metadata, and later adding proper UI functionality for editing the metadata.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560086938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560093758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8704#issuecomment-560093758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8704","id":560093758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDA5Mzc1OA==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T11:14:03Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T11:14:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#bug` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.80.

Think AD/LDAP in a corporate setting; not uncommon to belong to hundreds of groups. Regarding implementation, I would propose just adding a column \"role_based_filters\" or similar to the tables table with the metadata:\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n> {\r\n>   \"dept\": {\r\n>     \"default\": \"false\",\r\n>     \"roles\": {\r\n>       \"finance\": \"dept_id = 1\",\r\n>       \"risk\": \"dept_id = 2\"\r\n>     }\r\n>   },\r\n>   \"duration\": {\r\n>     \"default\": \"report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1\",\r\n>     \"roles\": {\r\n>       \"finance\": \"report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30\"\r\n>     }\r\n>   }\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> In this example, users that don't belong to any group would get a WHERE clause that returns zero rows due to the \"false\" clause (`SELECT col FROM table WHERE FALSE` -> no rows), and by default only the last days data would be available. If the user belongs to the \"risk\" Role, they would see only \"dept_id = 2\" for the last day (default clause for \"duration\"), whereas \"finance\" would see \"dept_id = 1\" for the last 30 days. Belonging to both would return data for both departments with 30 days of data.\r\n> \r\n> One could later add the same column to the charts table, making it possible to introduce the same functionality on a per chart basis. With regards to the filter statements, I would propose using the same filter format that's currently used for `adhoc_filters`, which would enable us to leverage existing React components that allow for a much more user friendly means to add filters. To introduce the functionality, I would break the SIP into two parts; first introducing the backend functionality, i.e. adding the new column to table, making it possible to edit the filters by poking at the table metadata, and later adding proper UI functionality for editing the metadata.\r\n\r\n@villebro I've been looking through your suggestions and I believe that there are a number of potential bugs / unintended consequences:\r\n\r\n1. When someone belongs to multiple groups, setting the default behaviour to OR together all the permissions seems like a dangerous assumption. This errs on the side of being maximally permissive, which is usually not advisable. The current setup forces the user to define what happens at intersections by creating another role for any combined roles and explicitly setting the clauses.\r\n\r\n2. Even if we were to OR together permissions, using a key-based JSON approach would likely not be the right one. By way of example, let's say that on table `exports`: \r\n```\r\nRole A has filters: country='Freedonia' AND item='Apples'\r\nRole B has filters: country='Ruritania' AND item='Oranges'\r\n```\r\nFor someone that has Role A and Role B, ORing together at a key-level would give the user access to not only reports on Freedonia Apple exports and Ruritania Orange exports (as you might expect) but also Ruritania Apple exports and Freedonia Orange exports (which may not be expected/desired in a lot of use cases).\r\n\r\n3. Having users directly manage large JSON objects to control row-based security is unduly cumbersome and inaccessible to some users, so a UI / SQL approach is preferable.\r\n\r\n4. The concept of defaults (and how to use them) again requires assumptions that will not fit a lot of use cases. For example, your proposed setup only works where the default is more restrictive than all of the roles. If there were a case where the default was to show last 15 days (`report_date >= current_timestamp() - 15`) but one of the roles was to restrict to only seeing the most recent day's data (`report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1`) then your setup would actually escalate permissions.\r\n\r\n5. The proposal to break the SIP into two parts, the first being only a back-end change to tables, means that most users will not have use of row-level security when this is released, which defeats the purpose of the SIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn answer to the above, I would suggest one of the following two approaches:\r\n\r\nA. Accept the pull request as-is, continuing to force users to explicitly define the permissions for any intersection cases (since there aren't any defaults that will work in all scenarios and that would lead to predictable behaviour for the user)\r\n\r\nB. Modify the current pull request to allow for roles to be combined by ORing together the entire clause in brackets, e.g.: \r\n`Role A & Role B: WHERE (country='Freedonia' AND item='Apples') OR (country='Ruritania' AND item='Oranges')`\r\n\r\nWith a preference for A.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560147328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560152670","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8699#issuecomment-560152670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8699","id":560152670,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDE1MjY3MA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T20:05:20Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T20:05:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the feedback, very good to have an exhaustive discussion prior to committing to any approach.\r\n\r\nI think there might be a misunderstanding about how the ORing approach should work. The basic idea is this:\r\n\r\n1) AND across different keys\r\n2) OR within keys\r\n3) apply default if user doesn't belong to any roles within a certain key\r\n\r\nIn my example, the following WHERE clauses would be generated:\r\n\r\n1) doesn't belong to any groups: `((false)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1))`\r\n2) belongs to \"finance\": `((dept_id = 1)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30))`\r\n3) belongs to \"risk\": `((dept_id = 2)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 1))`\r\n3) belongs to \"finance\" and \"risk\": `((dept_id = 1) OR (dept_id = 2)) AND ((report_date >= current_timestamp() - 30))`\r\n\r\nFor your example case, providing that these filter groups were made with the same key (as I understand they should), the following WHERE clause would be generated: `((country='Freedonia' AND item='Apples') OR (country='Ruritania' AND item='Oranges'))`, i.e. the user would *not* see Ruritania Apple exports.\r\n\r\nIn the case of having a default duration of 30 days and specifying a more restrictive filter group for 1 day, the default would not be applied, i.e. the user would only see one day's worth of data. Of course, if the user belonged to *two* restrictive groups, 15 days and 1 days, the more permissive role of 15 days would in practice apply. However, this seems like a logical error in how the roles are assigned to users.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to start by rolling out the backend functionality was merely a proposal to keep the PRs as small as possible and easier to review/develop. However, I'm sure they can be done together, assuming the person working on the PR is proficient in both the frontend and backend aspects of the codebase.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560152670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560158272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8334#issuecomment-560158272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8334","id":560158272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDE1ODI3Mg==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-01T20:58:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T20:58:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

We used docker to deploy the superset，and the version of Python is  2.7.5. when i create a heat map in my dashboard, and use a field of type timestamp as the time field.\r\nThen i choose the Last year as the Time range , and  choose the month as the region the day as subregion, and count the number of  fields as queries . After i run this query , I saw the problem I was asking.  Does this have anything to do with superset`s version?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560955597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560956494","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/8723#issuecomment-560956494","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8723","id":560956494,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDk1NjQ5NA==","user":{"login":"suddjian","id":1858430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian","html_url":"https://github.com/suddjian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suddjian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-03T01:29:29Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T01:29:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"oops branched this off the wrong branch, brb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/560956494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
