But it will take some time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/522389248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/522389548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11000#issuecomment-522389548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11000","id":522389548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjM4OTU0OA==","user":{"login":"pissang","id":841551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTU1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang","html_url":"https://github.com/pissang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T02:33:28Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T02:38:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"应该是个 bug，@deqingli 截图的这个不是正确的复现方式，应该是代码中动态修改是失效的","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/522389548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/522391311","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10999#issuecomment-522391311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10999","id":522391311,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjM5MTMxMQ==","user":{"login":"pissang","id":841551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTU1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang","html_url":"https://github.com/pissang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T02:44:39Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T02:44:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@weizihahaha 应该是你引入的方式有问题。跟网络没关系，echarts 现在也没限制地图的使用（只是官网上不显示提供地图数据了）","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/522391311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/522392660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/11043#issuecomment-522392660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/11043","id":522392660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjM5MjY2MA==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-19T02:52:37Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T02:52:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!
