I didn't get a chance to review v4 format and want to be on the same page here w.r.t changes / improvements being made. \r\n\r\nWant to also make sure that V4 subsumes the V3 format changes I had introduced since V3 supports a critical production use case of ours. It is configurable through FieldConfig. I wanted to make V3 default going forward but looks like you want to make V4 default. \r\n\r\nSo, let's please have a short discussion to get clarity on the path forward. I can then help review this and PR https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7934 \r\n\r\nWill follow-up offline on the discussion.

That might take a little longer for the author, but it benefits all of us in the long run.\r\n\r\nThere were no optimisations in this PR, there were some fixes for concurrency bugs (e.g. it's incorrect to use an increment operator on a volatile variable) so I'm not sure what you're referring to. \r\n\r\n> One example of this issue happened last week when we spent a long time finding the root cause for the chunk index writer bug. The problematic optimization was added in a PR with title Add MV raw forward index and MV BYTES data type. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is the best place to be discussing this but you are implying that the change you mentioned was unrelated to the PR it was made in, but it wasn't. The purpose of the change, as has been discussed, is that the particular class creates very large buffers. It was included in that PR because its use for MV BYTES columns exacerbates this by multiplying what is already an overestimate of the buffer size by the maximum number of elements in the column. So the change was a mitigation to the worst case made worse by that PR.\r\n\r\n> The table having performance problem didn't have any multi-value columns or byte data type.

Basically, with V4 the use of memory mapped buffer for compression is pretty much eliminated. So the direct buffer is introduced in this PR to help improve the performance for the vast majority of cases \r\n\r\n- Regarding V3 v/s V4: they have similarities but the main difference is 4GB limitation imposed in V4. V3 has no such limitation as the chunk offset in the file header is tracked using `long`. V3 also derives the `numDocsPerChunk` (as opposed to using fixed 1000 rows per chunk) or packs a single row in the chunk if the `row > 1MB`. In V3 we never thought of using memory mapping for compressed buffer even though our chunks are potentially huge in size (from the production use case where V3 is being used). \r\n\r\n- Regarding changing the default from V2: I didn't make V3 default initially since wanted to test it out in production.

So all queries go to the other server which has not been restarted and has ingested the latest stream events.\r\n\r\nIt does lead to split views in our experiments.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned in https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7274, the time threshold doesn't guarantee the server will be all caught up when the wait is over.\r\n\r\n> Realtime consumption status checker is used at startup time in Pinot Server to define a catch-up period in which no query execution happens and stream consumers try to catch up to the latest messages available in different streams. The current realtime consumption status checker defines a time threshold for startup consumption. When the wait time after Pinot Server starts up passes that time threshold, the status checker returns ServiceStatus.GOOD.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/999826256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/999962600","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7779#issuecomment-999962600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7779","id":999962600,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c47mjfo","user":{"login":"dongxiaoman","id":11821736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIxNzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11821736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman","html_url":"https://github.com/dongxiaoman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongxiaoman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-23T00:41:18Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T00:41:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The replication factor is 2.\r\nAt the time of this error being reported, we had enforced the rule in our Pinot Java Client to throw exception whenever there is one segment not being processed.

They shouldn't be returned (like how doing `select *` right now doesn't return the virtual columns).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1001020152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1001158235","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7960#issuecomment-1001158235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7960","id":1001158235,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c47rHZb","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-26T11:10:50Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T17:17:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7960?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7960](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7960?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (772888e) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/99762cbb89e6bc3c2609667771a04b4c70e0056d?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (99762cb) will **decrease** coverage by `0.00%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7960/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/7960?src=pr&el=tree&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #7960      +/-   ##\n============================================\n- Coverage     71.34%   71.33%   -0.01%     \n- Complexity     4191     4195       +4     \n============================================\n  Files          1595     1595              \n  Lines         82568    82568              \n  Branches      12320    12320              \n============================================\n- Hits          58906    58904       -2     \n- Misses        19678    19687       +9     \n+ Partials       3984     3977       -7     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `29.01% <ø> (-0.03%)` | :arrow_down: |\n| integration2 | `27.66% <ø> (+0.07%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests1 | `68.24% <ø> (+0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `14.30% <ø> (+0.02%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.

for the fix, @jadami10!\r\n\r\nAs to the concern of running multiple Server instances on a single machine, the interference may be avoided if each Server instance creates tmp- dir under its own `dataDir`, and this is already done for all tmp- dir created in the pinot/core/data/manager module today.\r\n\r\nWe may extract tmp dir creation and cleanup logic to a util class to manage its naming convention and location in one place, in case later on, folks use tmp. or temp- prefix or put them outside dataDir, making your cleanup logic less effective.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1004557685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1004574477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7916#issuecomment-1004574477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7916","id":1004574477,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c474JcN","user":{"login":"atris","id":1724131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1724131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris","html_url":"https://github.com/atris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-04T07:12:37Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T07:12:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Discussed
