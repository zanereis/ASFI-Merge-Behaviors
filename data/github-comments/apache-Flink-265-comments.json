I was aware that this will break the behavior for partition discovery. However, the current implementation was already broken for user at large scale, as pointed out in the description. This PR was intended as a quick solution for this case. I think that we can have better non-breaking solutions in the future like splitting the source into two operators or a different state partitioning scheme. I think that we can close the PR and go for the long term solution in official releases. Nevertheless I think that we should cherry-pick two parts of this PR into releases, the hotfix to improve memory utilization and the option to remove operator state (or - even better - states in general).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413787110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413787139","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6367#issuecomment-413787139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6367","id":413787139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzc4NzEzOQ==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T07:50:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T07:50:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

did some more digging and it is in fact there is a good reason for this patch.\r\n\r\nHave a look at https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka-0.11/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/FlinkKafkaProducer011.java\r\n\r\nThere you'll find constructors with essentially the following variations in parameters:\r\n\r\n- Either a SerializationSchema or a KeyedSerializationSchema\r\n- Either a FlinkKafkaPartitioner or no partitioner which means it actually uses FlinkFixedPartitioner as the default.\r\n\r\nLooking at all of these constructors\r\n\r\n1. If you do not specify a partitioner then all constructors use the FlinkFixedPartitioner.\r\n2. If you do specify a partitioner then it will use that partitioner.\r\n\r\nEven the constructor that uses a KeyedSerializationSchema will NOT use that key for the partitioning (which we saw in production which caused problems).\r\nEssentially the current FlinkKafkaProducer API makes it very hard to 'not' specify a partitioner and use the hash(key) partitioning which is nativly present in Kafka.\r\n\r\nSo give the current API we came to the conclusion an extra partitioner is needed.\r\n\r\nBecause the Flink API works this way I never looked deeper into base code to see how it really moves below the surface.\r\n\r\nGiven what I understand now I see two viable ways forward:\r\n\r\n1. We change the behavior of the API so that if a KeyedSerializationSchema is used that in that case the hash of the key will be used by Kafka to partition the data over. This is however an impact full change in the way the API behaves. I.e. breaking the API.\r\n2. We simply add the partitioner I created.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413893719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/413909036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6494#issuecomment-413909036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6494","id":413909036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzkwOTAzNg==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T15:53:00Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T15:53:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xccui the travis failure is not caused by this PR's change.

I haven't thought this through, but one option would be by using generics. Other by extracting some common interfaces. With a base class of `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase`, you could probably use it in the tests with defining one abstract method `protected FlinkKafkaConsumerBase createFlinkKafkaConsumer(...)`.\r\n2. I think we should refactor old tests and deduplicate the code. It's very depressing when basically one variable rename `sequenceNumbers` to `nextSequence ` is forcing us to add ~3000 lines of codes. \r\n3. I don't know, since I have no idea what's the status of 1.1 support by our `0.11` connector or this new `1.0` connector. If this newly added `1.0` connector can support without any issues Kafka `1.1`, there might be no need to add new module, but still this should be documented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/414945937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/414951008","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6577#issuecomment-414951008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6577","id":414951008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDk1MTAwOA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T08:16:09Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T08:16:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pnowojski I am refactoring the code to reduce unnecessary code. \r\n\r\nActually, the change from kafka v0.11 to v1.0, Not just a variable, there are some tests code that are not available, see [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6577/files#diff-527838fe63568e530d871d45a98e3fe4R157) and [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6577/files#diff-527838fe63568e530d871d45a98e3fe4R168).
