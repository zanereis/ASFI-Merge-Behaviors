The heron client sets a number of environment values and passes parameters to main, so you'd need to mimic the client interaction if you want to run the main directly. I recommend reading the client code at tools/client/src/python to see how you could mimic the client behavior in this way, or just run the topology using the heron client.

current approach has limitations, but it also has simplicity and transparency.

I wanted to make sure we've thought about how to help a user answer these questions (for example) when backpressure is occurring, ideally without having to sift too much through logs:\r\n\r\n- Which components are responsible for the back pressure and in what order? Should this be a metric?\r\n- Which ones have released their call for back pressure, which are remaining?\r\n- Are bolts not emitting because they're under backpressure, or because they're not receiving tuples?\r\n\r\nI haven't yet reviewed the code, but wanted to hear your thoughts on these so I'd know what to expect. From past experience understanding backpressure hasn't always been easy with the existing implementation.\r\n\r\nMy question about the bolts not emitting was because with the new approach you would stop upstream bolts from emitting but others would continue to emit, as I understand it.

If those are somehow highlighted when in backpressure that would be huge. (Being able to link to a viz plot that shows which container is in BP over time would also be a big win, but this is beyond the scope of this PR.)\r\n\r\nAlso, just as an FYI, we've also discussed being able to highlight which containers have registered/not registered with TMaster in that same view during the submit process. This is of course also outside of the scope of this PR, but another use case to keep in mind when developing the highlighting functionality.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/291922063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/291936658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1795#issuecomment-291936658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1795","id":291936658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTkzNjY1OA==","user":{"login":"smirnp","id":10846549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ2NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10846549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp","html_url":"https://github.com/smirnp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smirnp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-05T17:31:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-05T17:33:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have found the issue of the problem.   \r\nPlease check the contents of the org\\apache\\storm\\spout\\RawMultiScheme.class \r\nStorm's class is working, Heron one is not.
