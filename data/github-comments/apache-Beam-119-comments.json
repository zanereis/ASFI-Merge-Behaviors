this PR I plan to remove force streaming. It was necessary since streaming/batch was decided based on Source type, but with `Pipeline#replaceTransform` I could replace any `Read.Bounded` with an adapted `Read.Unbounded` if `options.isStreaming()`. So the pom we'd be good as it is now.\r\nLike I told you a few day ago, I plan to entirely separate batch/streaming because it appears that Spark doesn't support Flattening of RDDs (bounded) and DStreams (Unbounded) in a resilient manner.
