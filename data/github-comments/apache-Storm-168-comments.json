everyone for the feedback on the code.  I am beginning to appreciate some of the challenges of serialization, in particular whatever serializer is registered with kryo can only be invoked with a default constructor, so my naive implementation, which relies on initializations via constructors in some spots will not work. The meaning of @revans2's comments about reading data from a special file in the jar are also becoming clearer to me -- that's a way to get information needed for initialization without relying on constructor parameters.  I'll take another pass at cleaning up at least some of these issues and fixing/addressing comments.  There's some excitement here about using our Confluent registry to speed up serialization, so I really want to make this work.\n\nThese are some new corners of java for me, so in the worst case scenario I'll simply have learned a lot.
