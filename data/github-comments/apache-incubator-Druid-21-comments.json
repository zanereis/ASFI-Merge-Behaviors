Writing up a more complete view on loadByPeriod.\n\nI am actually okay with redefining the semantics of loadByPeriod, and they should be changed to make more sense. The one use case that is currently problematic is that the router uses rules to determine how to forward queries. In a setup where you have different brokers dedicated to different time ranges, if the router receives a 1 yr query, we want this query to route to the broker dedicated for slow (older) queries. The changes here would mean the query would be forwarded to the brokers dedicated for fast queries. I am 100% in favor of removing the router entirely and having the routing logic live on the brokers.\n\nOne simple workaround is to introduce a new rule type, loadByPeriodByOverlap or something and use that. The correct solution is to rethink the router and some of the rules, which may require some more time dedication.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/102156623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/102182239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1362#issuecomment-102182239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1362","id":102182239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjE4MjIzOQ==","user":{"login":"anubhgup","id":6859038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTkwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6859038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup","html_url":"https://github.com/anubhgup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anubhgup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-14T22:03:07Z","updated_at":"2015-05-14T22:03:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @fjy.

So _in general_ the technique works. The question simply remains how best to test that this task still functions.\n\nA few options for adding in hadoopy tests are:\n1. Add hadoopy stuff in the official integration test\n2. Add self-contained but still integration tests as a separate maven profile (example `maven clean test -P IT`)\n3.
