I wanted to help him with a \"Multi Project\" module. The idea was to create a decorator `Project` implementation that would delegate to all the other `Project` implementations that can physically recognize and handle the same directory. When user invokes build - it would invoke build via NPM and also via Gradle. The logical view would be merged. Queries like classpath would be delegated to both projects and their result merged as well.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is not always what the user wants, so I was thinking of a UI that would allow the user to select the (set of) project(s) to delegate to. E.g. user could choose that only Gradle is preferred and the IDE should only invoke Gradle actions. Later, the user could switch to NPM view and work with the project only from the node.js perspective, completely ignoring Gradle.\r\n\r\nSuch \"Multi Project\" would implement \"natures\" in a reasonably natural way. \"natures\" - e.g. the current `Project` implementations would completely care about their physical representation on disk and physical commands to execute. The \"Multi Project\" would be just the UI to control & delegate to the \"natures\".\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell @lkishalmi attempt is heading in the same direction. Just it starts with API change, I wanted to prototype the solution from outside. Solving the problem may turn into significant effort and having the ability to offer it as an extension module could help us get some user feedback before we change such a core functionality of the IDE. Ideally, once we succeed, all `Project` instances obtained from `ProjectManager` would be instances of the \"multi project\".\r\n\r\nBtw. let's CC @jglick - he introduced the `ProjectManager` and fought hard against \"natures\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/515900371/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/516124080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1399#issuecomment-516124080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1399","id":516124080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjEyNDA4MA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T19:12:35Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T19:12:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged via: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/commit/f0d26e4294bf2090a4a705a3317120504d932572","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/516124080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/516136947","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1403#issuecomment-516136947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1403","id":516136947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjEzNjk0Nw==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-29T19:50:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T19:50:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am afraid I am not sure how exactly this patch should help?

Could work when the two projects merged into the Multi Project are sufficiently different (like possibly Java Gradle and NPM). Unlikely to work for two Java projects, but that is presumably fine. Maybe we would have a Multi Project that would allow only such combinations of projects that are known to work.
