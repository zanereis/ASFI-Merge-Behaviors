If we really want to support \"get_params()\" when we use RNN function, we may make use of module class to buffer the ops, then there won't be any actual run. In this case, all the parameters size will be obtained after the forward function and so we can use\"get_params()\" afterward. Say if we don't want to use graph after getting the parameter size, we can use ResetGraph to clear the buffer, then turn off buffer and run without graph.
