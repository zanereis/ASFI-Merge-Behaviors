为什么这么说：假如消息队列为[BrokerA1,BrokerA2,BrokerA3,BrokerA4,BrokerB1,BrokerB2],只有当上一次轮训到BrokerA4时，这里才会跳过BrokerA而得到BrokerB的队列\r\n                    // 而且，可能下次更新路由表时，该信息可能就会成为过期数据而被GC，我猜作者是觉得反正这个数据快没用了，不如把它替换成刚才得到的推荐节点信息，这样可以少new一个对象，还能增加下次查找时的效率\r\n                    // 之所以说它能增加效率，是因为这个过程实质上是将一个很可能宕机的节点队列换成了最可能可用的节点信息，那么下次再轮训到这个节点时，实际上就跳过了寻找推荐节点的过程\r\n                    final MessageQueue mq = tpInfo.selectOneMessageQueue();\r\n                    if (notBestBroker != null) {\r\n                        // 把得到的队列的BrokerName改成我们前面得到的推荐节点，这样如果再请求失败并且重试的时候，lastBrokerName其实存储的就是推荐节点的信息了，下次再执行本函数时就会优先使用推荐节点的其他队列\r\n                        mq.setBrokerName(notBestBroker);\r\n                        // 重新计算其队列编号，因为得到的这个队列数可能和推荐节点的队列数不一致，如果用了错误的队列序号，消息发送到Broker那时，肯定会报错\r\n                        // 因此，这里基于外层轮询使用的index，对本次使用的队列编号进行了计算，我觉得这里最终达到的是随机选择的效果\r\n                        mq.setQueueId(tpInfo.getSendWhichQueue().getAndIncrement() % writeQueueNums);\r\n                    }\r\n                    return mq;\r\n                } else { // 推荐节点不存在可写队列了，说明该节点可能已经宕机，并且NameServer已经删除了其路由信息，并且已经同步过来了\r\n                    // 这时候可以将该节点从延迟统计表中删除，不在考虑该节点\r\n                    latencyFaultTolerance.remove(notBestBroker);\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                log.error(\"Error occurred when selecting message queue\", e);\r\n            }\r\n            // 如果拿到的推荐节点已经不存在可写队列了，就随机选一个队列\r\n            return tpInfo.selectOneMessageQueue();\r\n        }\r\n        // 默认策略\r\n        return

@duhenglucky\r\ni am new to rocketmq. RocketMQ is cool and become more and more popular, so i'd like to help you guys to make the *quick start* more friendly to newbies like me. If there are some errors in my statement, please point out.\r\nhere we go, after some investigation, these are what i find:\r\n* the Start Broker part is fine, because parameter `-n locolhost:9876` set the name server.As that's a quick start, if you can put that in configuration file by default, that will be really nice.\r\n* `No route info of this topic problem` error. If i use the same 4.3.0 version client as the official site Simple Example page suggests, the broker(version 4.4.0) won't create topic automatically. however 4.4.0 version client works! My suggestions are:\r\n    1. modify the official site simple example page, modify the client version to 4.4.0  \r\n    2. As that's a quick start for newbie like me, add the `autoCreateTopicEnable = true` to broker config file by default\r\n    3. maybe you can check the code and find the real cause for this bug\r\n* all quick start examples should set name server by default,add some code like `producer.setNamesrvAddr(\"localhost:9876\")`\r\n* default broker jvm memory configuration is `-Xms8g -Xmx8g -Xmn4g`, that's almost kill my poor computer.....  i think you can make it smaller for our poor personal computer~ The professional company guys will configure that option by themselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/526080981/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/526089315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1279#issuecomment-526089315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1279","id":526089315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjA4OTMxNQ==","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T08:46:09Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T08:47:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

@qqeasonchen 增加单独的定时任务可以解决这个问题；另外，这里面有三个参数可以改一下来避免这个问题，diskMaxUsedSpaceRatio，diskSpaceCleanForciblyRatio这两个参数跟diskSpaceWarningLevelRatio比较接近的时候，会出现上述问题，也可以修改一下这三个参数，保证留有比较多的空间来及时删除文件。\r\n\r\n考虑到修改参数保留较多磁盘空间会使磁盘利用率下降，所以通过增加单独定时任务的方式修改并提了pr。请问提了pr要合并有什么要求么？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/528760372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/528777204","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1445#issuecomment-528777204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1445","id":528777204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODc3NzIwNA==","user":{"login":"turtleDeng","id":1830077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzAwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng","html_url":"https://github.com/turtleDeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turtleDeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T09:09:27Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T09:09:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry,
