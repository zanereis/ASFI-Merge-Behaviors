This change looks ok for most cases.  With the current defaults, there might be always a case where the strategy didn't start the  mxosrvr, but you would want it to be started. Consider a case where there were 5 failures within a minute, but 6th failure after 20 minutes.  I think this woudn't start the mxosrvr based on current defaults. This may not be considered as a vicious failure  as you have said, while six failures in a minute could be considered as a vicious.  Hopefully, we can tickle the DCS server some way externally to start the mxosrvr in such a case instead of waiting for 30 more

suggestion would be to change the defaults. If there are N failures in 5 minutes, stop restarting the mxosrvr for 30 minutes. If the current failure is more than X minutes away from the last failure, restart the mxosrvr.  N and X can be made configurable. 5 minutes was assumed that it takes around a minute to start the mxosrvr and register etc.  30 minutes is the breathing time needed to get back the node to normal state externally.  If it doesn't , then you would say 6 cores every 30 minutes.  Choosing N is no brainier, it should be a little more than it takes mxosrvr to start and register etc. Default value of 6 for N seems reasonable.  Choosing X is bit hard.   If the mxosrvr dies quite often due to queries from the application, this time is dependent upon how much time the application can wait to get another connection. This would matter when the mxosrvr resource is tight otherwise the application can always find another server to connect.  Default value of 5 or 10 minutes may be fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/357031070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/357031516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1344#issuecomment-357031516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1344","id":357031516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzAzMTUxNg==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T19:15:51Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T19:15:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW,
