I first trained ResNet-8 on Cifar10 dataset with **4 GPUs**, and achieved 0.838041 validation accuracy (ACC1) for the 40-th epoch. Then I resumed the checkpoint at 40-th epoch with **4 GPUs**, the evaluation accuracy becomes 0.847756 (ACC2). I also tried to resume the checkpoint at 40-th epoch with **single GPU**, the evaluation accuracy is also 0.847756 (ACC3).\r\n\r\nSince ACC2 == ACC3 > ACC1, it is quite strange where the bug comes from. As ACC2 == ACC3, it indicates the multi gpu synchronization process is correct. But ACC2 > ACC1, it also indicates the multi gpu synchronization process might be wrong. This is quite confusing. \r\n\r\n@mli Your suggestion is equivalent to check for ACC2 and ACC3, and the results is correct for that. \r\n\r\nP.S. Note that I added an initial evaluation of the checkpointed model performance right after loading the parameters, which is before resuming training. https://github.com/taoari/mxnet/blob/finetune-api/python/mxnet/model.py#L230_L254 is simply a copy of the evaluation code of https://github.com/taoari/mxnet/blob/finetune-api/python/mxnet/model.py#L329_L350. ACC2 == ACC3 > ACC1 shows that https://github.com/taoari/mxnet/blob/finetune-api/python/mxnet/model.py#L230_L254 is OK for both single GPU and multi GPUs, but https://github.com/taoari/mxnet/blob/finetune-api/python/mxnet/model.py#L329_L350 is not correct for multi GPUs. However, these two parts are of exactly the same codes, it is quite confusing where the bug comes from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267548450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267589917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4256#issuecomment-267589917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4256","id":267589917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzU4OTkxNw==","user":{"login":"howard0su","id":766788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Njc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/766788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su","html_url":"https://github.com/howard0su","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/howard0su/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-16T13:04:42Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T13:04:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This pull request is *not* ready for merge","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267589917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267608804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1758#issuecomment-267608804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1758","id":267608804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzYwODgwNA==","user":{"login":"yupbank","id":741544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/741544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank","html_url":"https://github.com/yupbank","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yupbank/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-16T14:44:52Z","updated_at":"2016-12-16T14:44:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i think this is a multi-class regression example? in multi-label regression, there is no softmax constrain across label dimensions.

Label width varies from image to image because # object varies, this have to be solved by padding or special process before loading the labels. Thus rec files must be prepared accordingly, I think it's better to unify this behavior across tasks.\r\n\r\n2. Data augmentations such like lighting/colorjitter/colornomalize can be reused from current functions, however, anything related to spatial transform must be handled differently: augmenter must take in label as well, cropping/flipping image will result in different labels.\r\n\r\n3. as a result of 2, the format of label for object detection tasks should be fixed, so we can always reuse the augmenter functions. Essentially we need labels in formats like this for each image:\r\n(im_width, im_height) - required for those using non-fixed size inputs(fast(er)-rcnn, etc) \r\n(object_id, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) x N - proportional or absolute bounding boxes\r\n\r\nJust wondering if you guys ever had plans or ideas like this? @piiswrong @sxjscience @precedenceguo ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267741366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267746149","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4266#issuecomment-267746149","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4266","id":267746149,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzc0NjE0OQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-17T06:20:33Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T06:20:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jspisak Could you put the log into docs","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267746149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/267746524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4225#issuecomment-267746524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4225","id":267746524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzc0NjUyNA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-17T06:29:19Z","updated_at":"2016-12-17T06:29:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1. you can pack array as label into rec and each record can have different label length\r\n2. the crop func etc returns the transformed image along with coordinates.

Is it the version from \"\r\n> A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05287.pdf), or from the older and less good (arXiv:1409.2329v5)? (or support both as options)\r\n\r\n> @sbodenstein Currently we've just coded the old version. The dropout method in the NIPS paper should be added later. Also, the performance boost in the paper is partially due to the dropout method for the embedding layer and we can also support it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Yarin, his implementation is already in  Keras, TensorFlow, and Torch. I think it basically uses the same dropout mask across timesteps on RNNs.
