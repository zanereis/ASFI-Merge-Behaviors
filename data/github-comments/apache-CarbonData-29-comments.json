This version only suppport DML,  \n        All tables for test are created by spark-sql(DML part), \n        and i submit queries to presto to get results.\n        I only tested the \"Select\" Case , like where, group , sum , join.\n\n\n    2.  I use APIs like createQueryPlan, resolveFilter from class \"CarbonInputFormatUtil\". \n       To read carbon formatted table, i make the read process into several steps:\n       a). load table metadata \n       b). get splits from table (pushing down filtering to filter datablocks of one segment @CarbonTableReader.getInputSplits2 )\n       c). parse records ( pushing down column projection and filtering into QueryModel  @CarbondataRecordSetProvider.getRecordSet ) \n\n\n    3. As i described  in partC \"parse records\", I use QueryModel to get  decoded records.\n       For lazy decoding,  I will keep on exploring a better solution.  Maybe we can get inspiration from module presto-orc, presto-parquet.\n      \n \n      \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2017-03-15 09:11:19, \"Jacky Li\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n\nThanks for working on this. Can you describe what feature is added in term of:\n\nWhat SQL syntax is supported? DDL &DML?\nI think it uses CarbonInputFormat to read, so are you pushing down column projection and filtering by setting the configuration in CarbonInputFormat?\nIs there any SQL optimization integration with Presto's optimizer? like leveraging carbon's global dictionary to do lazy decode?\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it
