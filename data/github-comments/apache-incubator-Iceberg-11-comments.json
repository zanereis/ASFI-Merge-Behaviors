We decided to go with a new API instead of extending `RewriteFiles` because it uses `DataOperations.REPLACE`, meaning the assumption is that files are removed and replaced without changing the data. Therefore, we created `ModifyFiles` with `DataOperations.MODIFY`.\r\n\r\nWe are accepting `baseSnapshotId` in the constructor instead of accepting it in the method. That way, it is transparent to the user and we can still track new files during retries. Also, we are accepting a row filter to do conflict resolution. Setting that row filter to `alwaysTrue` will be equivalent to what you have (i.e. retries will always fail). On top, that row filter allows us to do more fine-grained conflict resolution. For now, we limit the scope to partitions, meaning that if you are modifying files in one partition but a concurrent operation commits a new file to another partition, we can still commit successfully.

The problem that PR fixed was that a manifest was created, merged, and then deleted. Then the transaction failed to commit and retried. The manifest that was created was reused, but in the retry it didn’t get merged and was still a valid metadata file. Since the file had been deleted on the first try, the table was missing a manifest.\r\n\r\nThe fix was to introduce a lazy delete for cleaning up. The transaction keeps track of files to delete and deletes them after the commit succeeds. What might be happening here is the first time the transaction tries to commit, it is out of date and retries, then the original manifest is not deleted on the second attempt. Looking at the cleanup code, I think this looks like the problem because the filtered manifest cache is cleared as files are deleted: https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/MergingSnapshotProducer.java#L336\r\n\r\nI think the fix is to add a list of files that should be deleted on every attempt. When the filtered cache is cleared, each file should be deleted and moved to the delete list. That way future attempts also delete the files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/516594310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/516594683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/330#issuecomment-516594683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/330","id":516594683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjU5NDY4Mw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T21:02:51Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T21:02:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, could you test whether that solution fixes the problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/516594683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/516598482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/330#issuecomment-516598482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/330","id":516598482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNjU5ODQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-30T21:14:32Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T21:14:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another option for the fix is to avoid clearing the `deletedFiles` object that tracks deleted files in `BaseTransaction`.

It would be great to have a solution for the metadata files.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the current approach that you're taking here. So far, we've avoided file listing and I'd like to continue with that. This could also be expensive because the metadata folder that is listed contains metadata JSON files, snapshot manifest lists, and manifests.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of listing files to drop, the JSON format kept a list of old metadata files and could delete and remove files in that list? The number of old metadata files could be configured with a table property. Keeping, for example, 100 metadata file locations wouldn't take that much space in the JSON file and cleaning up the old paths would only require issuing delete calls and discarding the deleted paths. What do you think of this as an alternative approach?\r\n\r\nCurious what @aokolnychyi and @rdsr think of this as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/517069693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/517069798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/331#issuecomment-517069798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/331","id":517069798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzA2OTc5OA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T00:20:15Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T00:20:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

I would still avoid lists even for operational things if it doesn’t complicate the logic too much or impact the performance of other operations. If there is no better way, I think we can still use lists in this particular case. I would expect to see old files consistently but it might expensive.\r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- If we do use lists, how do we plan to handle cases when `write.metadata.path` changes over time? Am I correct that there is no guarantee that the current metadata location contains all files?\r\n- Iceberg tables can share locations. Can they share metadata locations? If yes, how do we plan to handle it? (include table UUID in `metadata.json` files?)\r\n- If we are to keep only 100 last files, does it mean that we will be deleting the most recent file on every commit?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/518031926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/518037226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/347#issuecomment-518037226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/347","id":518037226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODAzNzIyNg==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T21:22:13Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T21:22:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, that sounds good to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/518037226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/518039007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/253#issuecomment-518039007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/253","id":518039007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODAzOTAwNw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-04T21:47:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T21:47:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aokolnychyi, sounds good to me if that works for you!

If the required behavior is to fail if any file is added that matches the delete filter, then we can add a flag to set that like `validateAppendOnly` in `ReplacePartitions`. How about `validateNoConflictingAppends`?\r\n\r\nI think we want to make both behaviors available, but we should also consider making failure when a conflict is detected the default. `OverwriteFiles` currently implements an idempotent change: replace all data matching a filer with new data. The intent is for cases like overwriting an aggregation: you update the aggregation every hour and always produce a completely new copy independent of the data in the table. But, that use case is unlikely to run into a problem if `validateNoConflictingAppends` were the default. Instead of two concurrent runs both succeeding, one would fail.\r\n\r\nIf we want to fail if there are conflicting appends by default, then we could add `allowConflictingAppends` instead. We would also want to decide whether the current overwrite behavior in Spark should allow or not allow conflicting appends. I think if the default is to not allow them, then we should go with that. We can add a write option to allow conflicting appends, like \"is-idempotent\".\r\n\r\n@aokolnychyi, what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/518439477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/518447383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/350#issuecomment-518447383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/350","id":518447383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODQ0NzM4Mw==","user":{"login":"electrum","id":9230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum","html_url":"https://github.com/electrum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-06T00:16:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T00:16:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks like it can fail to cleanup if the process crashes after the drop.
