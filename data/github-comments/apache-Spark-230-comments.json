Seems we just want `TableReader` to create `RDD`s (general-purpose work) and inside a `TableScan` operator, we create Catalyst `Row`s (table-specific work). However, when we look at `HadoopTableReader`, it is actually a `HiveTableReader`. For every Hive partition, we create a `HadoopRDD` (requiring Hive-specific code) and deserialize Hive rows. I am not sure if `TableReader` is a good abstraction. \n\nI think it makes sense to remove the trait of `TableReader` and add a abstract `TableScan` class (inheriting `LeafNode`). All existing TableScan operators will inherit this abstract `TableScan` class. If we think it is the right approach. I can do it in another PR.\n\n@marmbrus, @liancheng, @rxin, @chenghao-intel thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49338675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49341477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1439#issuecomment-49341477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1439","id":49341477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzQxNDc3","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-17T17:58:18Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T17:58:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chenghao-intel explained the root cause in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2523.

Tried a few other parameters such as num_partitions, default_parallelism but nothing sticks. Confirmed the proportionality with container size. Have also been trying to tune the multiplier to minimize potential waste and I think 6% (as opposed to 7% as we currently have) is the lowest we should go.

The user may have multiple installations of Spark on the same Worker machine, and \"spark.home\" previously provided them a way to pick among these installations. We should keep this functionality, but make it optional as opposed to forcing it on them.\n\nAlso, since we no longer need \"spark.home\" anymore, it would be good to remove all occurrences of it to remove confusion (exception for backwards compatibility). However, this is slightly tricky because Mesos handles this differently from other modes.\n\nSo I suggest this: I will take over from here, because this change seems a little more involved than we originally imagined it to be. How does that sound?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49353609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49358485","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1466#issuecomment-49358485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1466","id":49358485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzU4NDg1","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-17T20:08:49Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T20:08:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tdas should this be back-ported into 1.0?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49358485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49359229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1466#issuecomment-49359229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1466","id":49359229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzU5MjI5","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-17T20:13:34Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T20:13:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tdas nvm - I think this just doesn't exist in 1.0 :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49359229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/49362826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/886#issuecomment-49362826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/886","id":49362826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzYyODI2","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-17T20:43:17Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T20:43:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 886.
