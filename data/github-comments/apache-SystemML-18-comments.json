Using released OpenBLAS:\r\n\t```bash\r\n\tsudo yum install openblas\r\n\tsudo ln -s /lib64/libopenblas.so.0 /usr/lib/libopenblas.so\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n3. Also, commented any threading logic in systemml.cpp to rule out possibility of bug due to extension APIs:\r\n\t```python\r\n        //if(NUM_THREADS == -1) {\r\n        //      NUM_THREADS = openblas_get_num_threads();\r\n        //}\r\n        // openblas_set_num_threads(NUM_THREADS);\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n4. Even though I was using newer Centos 7 and gcc 4.8 (both supporting avx instructions), I also tried updating binutils and reinstalling OpenBLAS as per https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/faq#binutils\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this is due to a performance bug in OpenBLAS on multi-socket machine: https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/611\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"physical id\" | sort -u | wc -l\r\n2\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/268121620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/268163276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/318#issuecomment-268163276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/318","id":268163276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODE2MzI3Ng==","user":{"login":"bertholdreinwald","id":10200727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAwNzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10200727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald","html_url":"https://github.com/bertholdreinwald","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bertholdreinwald/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T06:06:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T06:06:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome!

We can definitely consider \"conv-relu-conv\" pattern and \"relu-dropout\" pattern. It is important to note that we **support sparse operators** for most of these cases including sparse matrix multiplication. However, there is a tradeoff in the runtime performance of sparse operators v/s memory consumption (i.e. cusparse matrix multiplication with sparsity 0.4 will be slower than cublas matrix multiplication, assuming no conversion). Based on previous machine learning workloads, we decided to keep threshold of conversion 0.4, and that threshold is respected throughout the system (i.e. via examine sparsity). I see only three possible solutions that respect this design:\r\n1. Operator fusion (where temporary data is not converted to sparse). For example: this PR\r\n2. Reduce the threshold globally.

From my perspective, it only works around underlying issues that should be addressed at runtime level.\r\n\r\nFor example, for unary operations like relu, we could scan the input twice in order to determine the exact nnz of the output, and thus the correct sparse/dense format, before allocation. Having the nnz per row would also replace the log M allocations per row with a single allocation. Due to copy-on-write the sparse intermediate would then anyway not be updated, except for in-place indexing. Note that we do similar things for sparse matrix transpose as well.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is also a technical issue. Having the static flag would affect all operations in a session; coming through MLContext, even across scripts.

In this PR, I was disabling sparse (not caching) only when we observe a conv2d-related script. My concern is that sparsity threshold of 0.4 is way too optimistic for allocating vectors (for example: mini-batch deep learning script). I can try other approaches to reduce the impact of this threshold (for example: https://github.com/apache/incubator-systemml/pull/329), but eventually we will have to systematically address whether the sparsity threshold of 0.4 is appropriate choice for all our algorithms (including lenet, autoencoder, lstm, etc). Until then, I can close this PR as we do not have consensus.\r\n\r\n>> Having the static flag would affect all operations in a session; coming through MLContext, even across scripts.\r\nThat's a good point.

BLAS on OS X / macOS, currently, the preferred and default BLAS implementation is [Apple Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/reference/accelerate).  Like C-BLAS, Atlas, OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, etc, Accelerate implements the BLAS API, and in terms of performance, Accelerate is generally the fastest BLAS implementation on OS X / macOS. Also, just to be clear, Accelerate is part of OS X / macOS, and does not require any installation.\r\n\r\nFor example, a `pip install numpy` on OS X / macOS will result in NumPy automatically linked to Accelerate:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nnp.__config__.show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nblas_mkl_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\nopenblas_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_3_10_blas_threads_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_3_10_blas_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_blas_threads_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_blas_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\nblas_opt_info:\r\n    extra_compile_args = ['-msse3', '-I/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Headers']\r\n    extra_link_args = ['-Wl,-framework', '-Wl,Accelerate']\r\n    define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 3), ('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]\r\nopenblas_lapack_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\nlapack_mkl_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_3_10_threads_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_3_10_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_threads_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\natlas_info:\r\n  NOT AVAILABLE\r\nlapack_opt_info:\r\n    extra_compile_args = ['-msse3']\r\n    extra_link_args = ['-Wl,-framework', '-Wl,Accelerate']\r\n    define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 3), ('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/271441071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/271443304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/307#issuecomment-271443304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/307","id":271443304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTQ0MzMwNA==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-09T23:41:29Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T23:41:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@niketanpansare I ran the quick test above, and I did not see any `INFO accelerator ...` lines.
