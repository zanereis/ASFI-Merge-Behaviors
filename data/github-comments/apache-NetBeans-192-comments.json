@rothardo you don't have to push merge commits right away, its ok if the branch is a little bit out of date.\r\n\r\nWell, let's keep the number of commits minimal for a PR. Unless there is no conflict, or a dependency, you do not need to merge anything back from the master branch. In those rare cases when needed, it's better to do a rebase instead of adding a merge commit.\r\n\r\nSince you are working on your own branch, it is Ok to amend a previous commit. This way most PR-s would be only 1 commit.

my apologies on how ugly the code is.  I did not realize how much I depended on syntax highlighting.  I cleaned the code up and then started playing around with it, seeing if I could find a way to trigger the error intentionally, and I did.\r\n\r\nWhat I found is that I can use the generic to declare the Collection and to get and set the collection.  But the moment I change the parameter in the `addEntry()`, `doesEntryExist()`, and `removeEntry()` methods from a concrete class to the generic, the exception gets triggered and I lose syntax highlighting and Javadoc access.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following declaration will not trigger the exception (although it does create an error in the method) :\r\n\r\n`public boolean addEntry( String entry ) throws IllegalArgumentException`\r\n\r\nChanging the declaration to the following then triggers the exception immediately:\r\n\r\n`public boolean addEntry( <?> entry ) throws IllegalArgumentException`\r\n\r\nMessages log and code attached.

functionality does already exist in maven plugins for example, to name a one which tries to replicate the output of the `cloc` tool, simply run this in any maven project and you have output very similar to cloc:\r\n```\r\nmvn io.github.orhankupusoglu:sloc-maven-plugin:sloc\r\n```\r\nEvery project host, such as github, gitlab, bitbucket etc does also provide comparable code stats dashboards by default - you can't really escape it. There are even services which do nothing else but to generate stats.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the initial discussion on the mailing list which moved to an issue and was then again moved to a gh discussion: this is a very good usecase for a third party plugin in my opinion (just like the mentioned intellij plugin), which could integrate tools like `sloc-maven-plugin` and simply run them in the repo, or add a hint which injects this into mvn/gradle projects (for example) (even easier to implement), or actually reimplement it in another way. NetBeans was made to be extended!\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want to see this implemented in NB, since this would be a clear case of the \"not invented here\". We have enough to maintain already. Even intellij didn't implement it in the core, but waited till it was available as a plugin instead. My guess is that this feature is fairly niche and has low relevance for most projects, but if you need it for a slide of a presentation, its good to know a place which can generate those stats.\r\n\r\nBeside that I think this feature would fit very well to a plugin on the plugin portal, there is also no interest from the user who requested this feature to implement it, and also that no committer indicated the will to implement it, I see no real point to track this as an issue (there already is a discussion thread and a mailing list thread).\r\n\r\nNetBeans is a community project, we should only track things which someone wants to implement, or at the minimum where we agree that we should implement it at some point in future, the issue tracker is no wish list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1852988494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1853043995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6835#issuecomment-1853043995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6835","id":1853043995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5uczUb","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-12T23:51:15Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T23:55:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> It seems that this behavior has been introduced in Netbeans 18.

And it seems this PR is mostly in line with that. IMHO we gain little renaming packages or other things. We risk though internal breakage as we have sites that refer to modules, options, translations by name and these are hard to catch.\r\n\r\nGoing through this PR @rothardo I notice:\r\n\r\n- What is the license of the image `instance.png`? The old was part of the donation from Oracle and thus relicensed to ALv2. A quick glance did not give me info about the license situation around the logo, the press page from Jenkins has a lot of yada-yada, but nothing substantial. I looked at the PNG and SVG both don't seem to have licenses attached. At least in my home country this makes the work non-redistributable.\r\n- In most files only UI strings were changed. This is different in, were also the keys are changed:\r\n  -  `ide/hudson.ui/src/org/netbeans/modules/hudson/ui/wizard/InstanceDialog.java`: `UI_JENKINS_SERVER_REGISTERED` and `USG_JENKINS_SERVER_REGISTERED`\r\n  - `php/hudson.php/src/org/netbeans/modules/hudson/php/resources/Bundle.properties` (+ use-sites): `LBL_JenkinsExportName`\r\n  - `php/hudson.php/src/org/netbeans/modules/hudson/php/ui/options/Bundle.properties` (+ use-sites): `BL_JenkinsPHPOptionsName`\r\n\r\nAll in this looks sane to me.

I was able to narrow this down some more. Maven project with source: [test.zip](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/files/13678553/test.zip)\r\n\r\nThe reproducer holds a single class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage test;\r\n\r\npublic class Demo  {\r\n\r\n    public Demo() {\r\n        Test2.test();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is used to trigger the error. The \"knob\" for checking is in the pom:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\r\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\r\n    <groupId>test</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>test</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    <packaging>jar</packaging>\r\n\r\n    <properties>\r\n        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>\r\n    </properties>\r\n\r\n    <build>\r\n        <plugins>\r\n            <plugin>\r\n                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\r\n                <version>3.11.0</version>\r\n                <configuration>\r\n                    <release>17</release>\r\n<!--                    <compilerArgs>\r\n                        <arg>-Xlint:all</arg>\r\n                    </compilerArgs>-->\r\n                </configuration>\r\n            </plugin>\r\n        </plugins>\r\n    </build>\r\n</project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the shown configuration, all is fine. When opening the test project, NetBeans correctly flags `Demo.java` as broken and in the file `Test2` is marked \"Symbol not found\" (there might be a different sentence, I translated from my german output). \r\n\r\nNow remove the comment symbols around the `compilerArgs` element in the pom. When I do that, I get instantly an exception that looks remarkably similar to the one shown here. When you know acknowledge the exception, you can change the `Test2` in `Demo.java` for example to `Test2231`. The diagnoses about the \"Symbol not found\" goes away, the exception pops up.\r\n\r\nAdd the comment symbols around `compilerArgs` again, acknowledge the exception, and diagnosis comes back, exception are not thrown anymore.\r\n\r\nTo me this looks like either a bug in the `ThisEscapeAnalyser`, which makes assumptions, that only hold if it is used on a tree without error or a bug in NetBeans integration, which should not call into the analyser phase of javac, when the tree has errors.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n@lahodaj could you please have a look at this? You worked in the area of the `ThisEscapeAnalyzer` and might have an idea how to fix this.\r\n\r\n@jjazzboss I modified the main `pom.xml` for your project like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/pom.xml\r\n+++ b/pom.xml\r\n@@ -45,7 +45,7 @@\r\n         <jjazzlab.javac.fork>false</jjazzlab.javac.fork>\r\n         <jjazzlab.javac.showDeprecation>true</jjazzlab.javac.showDeprecation>\r\n         <jjazzlab.javac.showWarnings>true</jjazzlab.javac.showWarnings>\r\n-        <jjazzlab.javac.xlint>-Xlint:all</jjazzlab.javac.xlint>\r\n+        <jjazzlab.javac.xlint></jjazzlab.javac.xlint>\r\n         <jjazzlab.surefire.plugin.version>3.1.0</jjazzlab.surefire.plugin.version>\r\n         <jjazzlab.surefire.skipTests>true</jjazzlab.surefire.skipTests>\r\n         <jjazzlab.forceEnglish>false</jjazzlab.forceEnglish>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd after switching the project to JDK 17, building it, restarting once, the project opens clean for me on a NetBeans, that is not that far from master. Given the analysis above, this seems sensible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1856713174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1857250356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6366#issuecomment-1857250356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6366","id":1857250356,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5us2Q0","user":{"login":"troizet","id":9607501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDc1MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9607501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet","html_url":"https://github.com/troizet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/troizet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-15T04:17:07Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T04:17:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">
