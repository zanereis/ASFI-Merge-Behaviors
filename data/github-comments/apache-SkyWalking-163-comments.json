first step for you to go through the contribution process in this project and for further contributions, if you will.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the problem itself, there're multiple fixes in my mind, but instantiating it eagerly seems to fit this case most, `FileWriter` is mostly always used in production, `volatile` makes it always loaded from the memory in every call, and thus does more harm than good. @wu-sheng's suggestion \"with inner static holder\" also makes sense to me","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/629289548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/629568773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/4790#issuecomment-629568773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4790","id":629568773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTU2ODc3Mw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-16T01:27:52Z","updated_at":"2020-05-16T01:27:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@EvanLjp
