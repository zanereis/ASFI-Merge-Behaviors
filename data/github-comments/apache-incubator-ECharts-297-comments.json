think use ua is a better way？\r\n /(Mobile|Android|Windows Phone)/.test(navigator.userAgent) to judge isTouchDevice and use window.TouchEvent to judge hasTouch.\r\n\r\n2020年6月29日 下午1:29，Zhongxiang.Wang <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> 写道：\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief\r\n\r\nThere are some issues reporting echarts can't detect properly whether touch-screen device supports touch events or not.\r\n\r\n  *   #7406<https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/7406>\r\n  *   #9301<https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/9301>\r\n  *   #12166<https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/12166>\r\n  *   #12823<https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/12823>\r\n\r\nCurrent detection way in zrender/src/core/env.js<https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/blob/master/src/core/env.js#L149> is not enough to be compatible with all kinds of devices.\r\n\r\nAnd I searched on StackOverflow<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4817029/whats-the-best-way-to-detect-a-touch-screen-device-using-javascript>, but it seems there is no the best way.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for more compatibilities, should we allow the developer to config it manually according to what themselves know about their devices?\r\nFor example, we may add a new option into zrender and echarts to specify whether touch event is supported.\r\nI have no such touchable device to test these, though.\r\n\r\nECharts\r\n\r\nvar zr = this._zr = zrender.init(dom, {\r\n    renderer: opts.renderer || defaultRenderer,\r\n    devicePixelRatio: opts.devicePixelRatio,\r\n    width: opts.width,\r\n    height: opts.height,\r\n    touchEventsSupported: opts.touchEventsSupported\r\n});\r\n\r\nZRender\r\noverrides env.touchEventsSupported if developer has specified manually\r\n\r\nif (opts.touchEventsSupported != null) {\r\n    env.touchEventsSupported = !!opts.touchEventsSupported;\r\n}\r\n\r\nMaybe this looks a blit weird.\r\nOf course, it would be better if there could be a good way to detect touchable device.\r\n\r\nOthers\r\n\r\nIn highcharts, it use /(Mobile|Android|Windows Phone)/.test(navigator.userAgent) to judge isTouchDevice and use window.TouchEvent to judge hasTouch.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are

(III)\r\n> We can provide frequently used time formats like YYYY for full year, MM for month number and so on. Moment.js and can be served as references.\r\n\r\nIf users intend to use `Moment.js`, do we prefer users to\r\n(a) \"use Moment in the `formatter` callback\"  ?\r\nor (b) \"use Moment as a plugin for formatter pattern\" ?\r\n\r\nIf (a), nothing need to considered in this feature design.\r\nIf (b), that means users can use Moment notations in our \"formatter patterns\". \r\nThus we need to consider the conflicts between the notation from third party libs and our existing notations.\r\n(for example, suppose the third party lib uses \"a\" to represent something, but in echarts \"formatter patterns\" `{a}` has been reserve to other meanings.)\r\nIf we want to avoid this conflict, may be other time-specific prefix need to considered in formatter pattern.\r\nFor example: `{%MM}:{%dd}`, where % is only used for time notation.\r\n\r\n## (IV)\r\nFor i18n, probably we could simply add some new built-in notations? (not sure)\r\nFor example:\r\n+ `{MMM}`:  represents: zh: `2月` , en: `Feb`\r\n+ `{MMMM}`:  represents: zh: `二月`, en: `February`\r\n+ `{do}`: represents: zh: `5日`, en: `5th`\r\n+ `{ee}`: represents: zh: `二`, en: `Tu`\r\n+ `{eee}`: represents: zh: `周二`, en: `Tue`\r\n+ `{eeee}`: represents: zh: `星期二`, en: `Tuesday`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/651196156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/651201240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12592#issuecomment-651201240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12592","id":651201240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTIwMTI0MA==","user":{"login":"creadone","id":990803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MDgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone","html_url":"https://github.com/creadone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/creadone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-29T15:41:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T15:41:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried to make the similar visual with custom series. @tomsoftware, maybe you find something useful until desired feature not implemented official.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61724715/echarts-plot-the-variance-of-signals","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/651201240/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/651224808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12864#issuecomment-651224808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12864","id":651224808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTIyNDgwOA==","user":{"login":"100pah","id":1956569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTY1Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1956569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah","html_url":"https://github.com/100pah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/100pah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-29T16:22:47Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T16:23:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@plainheart @wf123537200 \r\nIt's indeed a headache problem.
