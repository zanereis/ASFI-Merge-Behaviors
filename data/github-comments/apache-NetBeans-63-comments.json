Using a library for that task is a good idea because correctly escaping every character may be tricky and libraries such as **commons-csv** lift this burden.\r\n\r\nFor the creation of the .xls (Excel 97-2003) files the Apache **poi** library is used. However **poi** for some functionality depends on other libraries too. I have tried to include the minimum required dependencies to make it work as intended.\r\n\r\n[Dependencies](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/poi/poi/4.1.2/poi-4.1.2.pom) required by **poi** are:\r\n\r\n- commons-collections4\r\n- commons-math3\r\n- SparseBitSet (if I remember correctly it is required for functionality only used in the unit tests)\r\n\r\nFor the creation of the .xlsx (Excel) files again the Apache **poi** library is used. Additionally in order to write .xlsx it is required the **poi-ooxml**. This dependency has some other [dependencies](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/poi/poi-ooxml/4.1.2/poi-ooxml-4.1.2.pom):\r\n\r\n- poi-ooxml-schemas\r\n- commons-compress\r\n\r\nIn its turn **poi-ooxml-schemas** has too as a [dependency](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/poi/poi-ooxml-schemas/4.1.2/poi-ooxml-schemas-4.1.2.pom) the **xmlbeans**.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned I have tried to include the minimum set of required dependencies in order to achieve the required functionality. As you may see in the maven poms I have linked there are also other transitive dependencies that haven't been included.\r\n\r\nAll the above dependencies are licensed under the Apache license.\r\n\r\nMost dependencies are required for the .xls and .xlsx file creation.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess there are a significant number of dependencies but I think they are essential. What do you think? Do you have any suggestion about how to reduce the number of dependencies?\r\n\r\nIf adding too many dependencies is a concern maybe we could add only the .csv/.tsv support for now and reexamine the addition of the .xls/.xlsx support in the future?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I see there are some issues in travis such as missing license files. I will address them later if this is going to be accepted.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/642934047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/642965304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2160#issuecomment-642965304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2160","id":642965304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0Mjk2NTMwNA==","user":{"login":"KacerCZ","id":4249184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDkxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4249184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KacerCZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KacerCZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-11T22:35:46Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T22:35:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junichi11
