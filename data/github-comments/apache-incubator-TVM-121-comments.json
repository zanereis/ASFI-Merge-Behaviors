If that is the case, does it make sense to factor this out and maybe put this in a pass? That would avoid having to implement this for each operator.\r\n> Do we know what the quantization parameters are at each point in the Relay graph?\r\n\r\n@Leo-arm this is a very good point. For background, there are 2 parallel efforts in TVM community right now\r\n\r\n* Automatic Quantization - Quantization in Relay. FP32 model comes in and Relay pass quantizes it.\r\n* Supporting Pre-quantized models - The quantization happens outside of Relay and TVM. (This PR belongs to this category). Here, the main goal is to create new QNN ops that will be converted to existing Relay ops.\r\n\r\nWe can share the HW schedules between these two options.\r\n\r\nWhat you suggested is almost what happens today in the Automatic quantization project. It is also somewhat easier there because Automatic quantization only works with symmetric quantization.\r\n\r\nFor doing this in pre-quantized models, it is somewhat tricky because it happens on an op-by-op basis (`requantize` happens before in `concatenate`, but it happens later in `conv2d`. The zero point handling is different for `add` vs `multiply`). But, there are certainly some patterns that can be exploited to make it easier. For example, we can have a helper function that requantizes the inputs and then calls the main op, and all the QNN ops that follow this pattern can rely on the helper function. For now, this seems like a good intermediate point. As we get more ops and pattens, we can refactor those using helper functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520487623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/520487644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3753#issuecomment-520487644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3753","id":520487644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDQ4NzY0NA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T16:02:37Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T16:02:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For

This partially resolves our issue. In the long term, we might need #3670 to better manage graph level layout conversion. For topi schedule, I suggest we only add schedules for new layout when obvious performance benefit is shown. Otherwise we can just leverage existing layout schedules and convert nodes into that layout.\r\n\r\nYeah, we have investigated NHWC and NCHW layout in quantization model deeply and find NHWC could make us get better performance, otherwise we will introduce `pack`  operation internally to get the same effect (better locality)  of NHWC if using NCHW. However, when we execute the quantized model, we care the performance very much. The `pack` cost time we can not  ignore. @jackwish maybe could share his investigation result more.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/521074952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/521078772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3705#issuecomment-521078772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3705","id":521078772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTA3ODc3Mg==","user":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T02:30:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T02:30:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kevinthesun

I think it's a good starting point for dgl team to collaborate with you, there are a lot of opportunity for tvm to search best schedule for sparse matrix operations. It would be great if relay would be powerful enough so that user-defined message/reduce/apply_nodes(edges)/... in dgl could be converted to relay.\r\n\r\nI also agree that you should not couple sparse tensors and dense tensors. The sparse tensor usually act as adjacency matrix in graph neural networks, while dense tensor acts as features in most cases. They are quite different and there is no need to unify them.\r\n\r\nYes, CSR is not enough, you have no access to number of columns, and at least you should maintain the attributes in scipy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html. Note that there might be multiple values correspond to one position in sparse matrix (this is a case in multigraph, where there are more than ones edges between two nodes).\r\n\r\nMy concern is that should we allow user to define a favoured format for each sparse tensor. For different combination of sparse matrix (different density, different degree variance, ...) and operations (spmm, sparse attention, sparse softmax and so on), the best parallel strategy with its required sparse format is quite different. Though it would be great if autotvm could search for the best format, a given format would make the work much easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/521370100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/521377540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3636#issuecomment-521377540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3636","id":521377540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTM3NzU0MA==","user":{"login":"SWu","id":199065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTA2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu","html_url":"https://github.com/SWu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T19:06:18Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T19:06:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

We adopt the representation used in [TACO compiler] (https://github.com/tensor-compiler/taco) in which user can easily register `CSR = SparseFormat([Dense, Sparse])`. For each topi, we can then define operations and generate schedules for each sparse type (Maybe add an interface for registering ops & schedules or adopt the TACO style auto codegen?). The benefit of having an extra field in relay TensorType is that we can easily infer format and shape information from the Relay end. w.r.t. The tradeoff between having a new type or new field, I wonder if we want to maintain some consistency in between Relay and TVM Tensor Representation.

So``` r -  w[i+1] - w[i]``` can no longer get simplified.\r\n\r\nThe proposed idea is to make such expansion lazy. i.e. when we evaluate r, we would return the bound ```0 to w[i+1] - w[i]```.  So if we call evalset for r+1, it would be ```1 to w[i+1] - w[i]+1```. However, we find that the new bound is still dependent on some of the relaxed variables, in this case i, and we will continue to relax the min and max value after we get the resulting set.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/521813329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/521818584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3787#issuecomment-521818584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3787","id":521818584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTgxODU4NA==","user":{"login":"yinghai","id":1100089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDAwODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1100089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai","html_url":"https://github.com/yinghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T22:23:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T22:23:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@hlu1, since you have a similar version.
