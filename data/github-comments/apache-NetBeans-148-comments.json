@tbw777 ,\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Java compiler ignores \"static\" in inner interfaces and enums. The bytecode is exactly the same. You can test this yourself compiling these simple classes:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage a.b.c;\r\npublic class A {\r\n  public static interface AA {}\r\n  public static enum AAA {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage a.b.c;\r\npublic class B {\r\n  public interface BB {}\r\n  public enum BBB {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you compile these classes with `javac` you'll see that the generated `A.class` and `B.class` have exactly the same size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect performance, either. Since the generated bytecode is exactly the same the performance will be the same.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that this PR makes no difference to NetBeans. There will be no difference in performance, network consumption, etc.\r\n\r\nWe may approve it, since it does some cleaning of the source code, but I will have to review those 729 files, one by one, that you have changed, to make sure all your changes are correct. This is going to take some time to me, because I don't work for this. Maybe one week or two.\r\n\r\nDuring these two weeks I won't be able to do anything else, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nMaybe next time you send a PR you can ask in the mailing list if the PR is worth the effort reviewing, because we would prefer adding new features to NetBeans instead of reviewing PRs that make no difference in performance.

Why would anything change if it is ran again with the exact same state? Also when stop is set to true it will be reset on the next loop iteration without ever doing anything?\r\n\r\nSo, NetBeans, for a long time, allowed to process projects that would not fit into the memory while parsed&attributed. There were several tricks combined to let that happen, and one of them ability to re-load a class, that is already load from a classfile, from a source. That was part of the patched nb-javac, as ordinary javac cannot do that.\r\n\r\nSo, while processing many source files, it created an instance of javac, invoked the task for the first file, the task typically parsed&attributed (using all dependencies from classfiles), then the task was invoked for the second file (possibly re-loading an existing class load from classfile, but this time from source), etc. And if, at some point, the javac instance could not fit into memory, the toPhase signaled that, the task returned immediately, the infrastructure thrown away that instance of javac, created a new one, and started the task with the given file again (which then parsed&attributed it in the new javac instance, etc.). So, multi-file tasks generally can be called multiple (2) times for the same file, if there's not enough memory to process all at once.\r\n\r\nWith the removal of nb-javac, we've lost the ability to re-load classes from sources, so there was a need to do it differently. So, the current approach is \"all at once or file-by-file\" (either all files will fit into the memory, or the processing will run slowly creating a javac instance for each file), but it may still happen the processing will start in the \"all\" way, and then drop to \"file-by-file\", and that is again indicated by the toPhase result. I.e. if the achieved phase is not high enough, the task should stop, and it will be called again (in a file-by-file mode in practice, but the task should not care). So, this is the reason why we can't blindly increment the pointer, as that may lead to skipping some files (although in practice it would be rare, see below).\r\n\r\nThe reason for the pointer is that hint may in general force a change in dependencies - they may, e.g. say that a new dependency should be added, and we need to throw away the javac instance, and create a new one. This is what the pointer and `stop` variable are trying to achieve. In practice, this is not really common, and the ` while (currentPointer.get() < toProcess.size())` loop is executed only once.\r\n\r\nAlso, normally when javac crashes during toPhase, there will actually be an exception thrown, which is handled properly by the task.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, however, there is a single file, so most of the machinery described above is not useful, and it is also a file opened in the editor, and hence javac has already been run on it, so not exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nI was doing some experiments, and the solution probably is incrementing the pointer, we just need to limit that to only these conditions. I should be able to submit a PR shortly.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> the original code when imported the first time looked like this:
