this week, I change a lot of agent codes, refactor actually, as a result, sky-walking agent can ignore and sample trace in high performance. Also, it provided the mechanism to support analytic trace in the further.\r\n\r\nThese are new features:\r\n1. Remove the three maps of tag. This is be benifit for reducing cost and gc.\r\n1. Ignore request with certain suffix, such as: .css, .js, .png, etc.\r\n1. Adjust sampling mechanism for better performance. The new is: all segments are sampled, which changes to unsampled, iff 1) sampling is on, 2) no segment-refs, 3) can't get the sampling factor. When this trace status changes to **unsampled**, the context switch to **IgnoredTracerContext**, which will provide higher performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/309036474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/309036753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/222#issuecomment-309036753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/222","id":309036753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTAzNjc1Mw==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T14:12:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T14:12:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ascrutae @pengys5 You can review this pr now.
