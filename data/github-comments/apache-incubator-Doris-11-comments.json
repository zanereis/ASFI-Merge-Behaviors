Why not we use the syntax like MySQL do? Now you put \"inverted_index_columns\" in properties, if we add some more options to it, it will be more difficult to parse and difficult to user to use it. Such as we support more index type, and more options for each type of index, or we support index multiple columns in one index.\r\n2. You should propose `CREATE INDEX` and `DROP INDEX` syntax together. Because some of indices are created when they are needed. And then we should have an index name for each index, however if we create index in your way, user don't know index name explicitly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/536447776/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/536448001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/1816#issuecomment-536448001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/1816","id":536448001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjQ0ODAwMQ==","user":{"login":"wangbo","id":12951030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUxMDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12951030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo","html_url":"https://github.com/wangbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T07:56:34Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T07:56:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@imay

Why not we use the syntax like MySQL do? Now you put \"inverted_index_columns\" in properties, if we add some more options to it, it will be more difficult to parse and difficult to user to use it. Such as we support more index type, and more options for each type of index, or we support index multiple columns in one index.\r\n> 2. You should propose `CREATE INDEX` and `DROP INDEX` syntax together. Because some of indices are created when they are needed. And then we should have an index name for each index, however if we create index in your way, user don't know index name explicitly.\r\n\r\n@imay Yeah, `CREATE INDEX` and `DROP INDEX` will be supported later.

It will be done before we add this rowset to StorageEngine. If we found there are too many number of rowsets, we can try to merge some of them to a bigger rowset. Actually we can do it for all load operation, because it will improve our read performance. \r\n\r\nEven though we can do this, but I think it is not very urgent. For you example, when a segment has 1000 segment, the rowset size will be 100GB(1000 * 100MB), it will lead to other serious problem. Such as tablet balance, read performance. So I think for this proposal, you can leave this case aside.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/544145764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/544341047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/2017#issuecomment-544341047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/2017","id":544341047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDM0MTA0Nw==","user":{"login":"EmmyMiao87","id":25147274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQ3Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25147274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87","html_url":"https://github.com/EmmyMiao87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T04:09:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T04:09:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#2021
