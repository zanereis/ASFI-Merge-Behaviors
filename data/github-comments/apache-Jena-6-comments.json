This should be one cache per dataset, so there will need to be\na map `ConcurrentHashMap<String, Cache>` where the string is the serice URI.\n\n`getCache()` becomes `getCache(uri)`.\n\nNow when an update happens, only the cache for the dataset needs to be invalidated.\nIt also leaves open the possibility of different cache settings for different datasets.\n\n**No Cache**\n\nWhat happens if `SPARQL_Query` (SPARQL_Query_Daatset) is used directly?\nIn other words, do things work for a datset if called dirctly, not via SPARQL_Query_Cache?\n\nThen whether the cache is used can be as simple as switching the SPARQL_\\* implementation.\n\n**Cache key**\n\nCan the cache key be simply based on the query object+responsetype?  Queries are equal if they are the same structure.\n\nSee org.apache.jena.atlas.lib.Pair as an example of a class that is good as a key\nbecause it provides `.hashCode` and `.equals` based on it structure, not it's object identity.\nIt devolves work to the two elements.\n\n**Inherit to share code**\n\nSPARQL_Query_Cache seems to have a lot of the operations of SPARQL_Query.  Can the code by DRYed (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)?\n\nIt looks to me like SPARQL_Query_Cache can share with SPARQL_Query. It needs to do that by extending SPARQL_QueryDataset then\noverride `execute()` (that will need to make that protected in SPARQL_Query), then have generateKey, getKey, getCache.\n\nTo call `SPARQL_Query` from `SPARQL_Query_Cache`, the no cache hit path, instead of:\n\n```\nActionSPARQL queryServlet = new SPARQL_QueryDataset() ;\n                    queryServlet.executeLifecycle(action) ;\n```\n\nuse\n\n```\n    super.execute(....)\n```\n\nA new `SPARQL_QueryDataset` does not get created each time.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/165791089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/166005604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/95#issuecomment-166005604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/95","id":166005604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjAwNTYwNA==","user":{"login":"samaitra","id":369459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/369459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra","html_url":"https://github.com/samaitra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samaitra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-19T17:24:47Z","updated_at":"2015-12-19T17:24:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@afs Thank you Andy for feedback.

I totally understand that changing `Triple` and `Quad` is significant, so that caution is the order of the day.\n2. I'm not sure of what you mean by the \"compiler implications\". I think that what's in this PR is just as typesafe as what is in `master` now without any more overhead, but I'm happy to correct any examples that pop up. We could get rid of the extra slots by offering a fixed-size tuple constructor `Tuple(byte size, T... elements)`, which might be nice anyway.\n3. I don't understand how the notions of equality are different here, but I haven't thought as much about triples as have you. Only two `Triple`s with the same subject, predicate and object are equal now, and only two such triples are equal in this PR. (More or less the same for `Quad`s.) I've added a commit to show that. Am I missing something about how two `Triple`s could be `equal` when they aren't equal as `Tuple`s? I was careful to fix subject, predicate and object to _specific_ components of the `Tuple` (`0`, `1`, and `2`). I don't think this PR can generate problems with triples with different orders of components.\n4. I actually find `nodes[1]`, etc. much clearer than `first`, etc., because the numbers help me understand what is going one, but I think that's a matter of personalities, so it's no argument in favor of the PR.\n\nBasically, since `ColumnMap` is designed to work with `Tuple`s only, I did this in order to use it without incurring lots of extra object creation. If we don't go that road, cool, I'll look at creating something like `ColumnMap` but targeted at `Triple` and `Quad`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/167593138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/167630549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/110#issuecomment-167630549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/110","id":167630549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzYzMDU0OQ==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-28T19:11:31Z","updated_at":"2015-12-28T19:11:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Do you want me to close this in light of #115 ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/167630549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/167763543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/114#issuecomment-167763543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/114","id":167763543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Nzc2MzU0Mw==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T10:44:05Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T10:44:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Main comment : the grammar changes haven't been put inside `#ifdef ARQ` so they happen in strict SPARQL 1.1 as well as the extended ARQ language.\n\nKeeping the SPARQL 1.1 parser exactly as the SPARQL 1.1 spec is important.

As a data structure that can be right at the heart of CPU bound operations, this may make a noticeable difference to Triple. At a bare minimum, experimentation would be necessary to verify the consequences of the change.\n\nEvery time the code has `(Node ... arg)` there is an array created.  So if I read it right, in `QuadOrdering.unmapAndCreate` there are 2 temporary arrays and several method calls including inside `unmap`, yet the current code does this directly (`QuadTableForm.quad`) by reordering use of arguments.  Actually, the important case is the reverse direction: `PMapQuadTable._find` (more results than patterns so more comes out that goes it).\n\nHave you run a profiler on the code?\n\nI think there is a lot to be said for the reordering version - write out the combinations once, test extensively. TDB is not a good example here. (1) it is disk backed and the costs are different (2) seeing the current TxnMem code, it could be better though there are more important gains elsewhere.\n\nThis PR seems like a lot of change to tidy up relatively few lines.\n\nThe concept of reordering is specific to indexing.  At some point, somewhere there is going to be some fiddly bit of code to do reordering. It's the mismatch between a hierarchical index where order is important and uniform accessible of sequences - it's analogously SQL tables and e.g. ISAM, VSAM style access which can be used to build SQL tables.\n\nOne of the things I tried to improve with `TupleMap` is the ability to use it for the index mapping, not just `Tuple` to `Tuple`.  I found get the naming right hard; it depends on how you think about mapping - whether it getting from the unmapped tuple to putting in the mapped tuple.\n\nAn illustration of one possibility: [TripleOps](https://github.com/afs/jena-workspace/blob/master/src/main/java/tupledev/TripleOps.java) shows two things: adding an external function to give triples an SPO order and using that operation to work between triples and tuples.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/167976621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/168017775","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/110#issuecomment-168017775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/110","id":168017775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODAxNzc3NQ==","user":{"login":"ajs6f","id":110994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f","html_url":"https://github.com/ajs6f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajs6f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-30T15:17:24Z","updated_at":"2015-12-30T15:17:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Well, this branch is clearly not worth rebasing post #115, and I haven't run a profiler on it anyway.

Right now code like 'TripleTableForm`and`QuadTableForm` have many places where exactly the same reordering logic is repeated, with only a method name difference. It's hard for me to believe that there isn't a better way to do this. I just need to find one that doesn't incur extra expenses while working with Java's single-valued functions.

I went for a 10-slot Atlas cache, which is a LRU cache in my understanding though the decision is left to the CacheFactory. I think it's big enough that it's unlikely to be ever filled by a single SPARQL query (I can imagine having, say, 2 text queries each being fed 4 different properties, which could fill 8 slots, but not much more), but small enough to not use huge amounts of memory - if a TextHit object within a Multimap takes around 100-200 bytes (very rough estimate) and a text query normally returns at most 10000 results, then the cache could take at most around 10-20MB (1-2MB per entry) but usually a lot less than that.\n\nIn the last commit (32c1c13) I switched to `getOrFill` to handle cache misses. I'm not sure if it improves clarity. The number of lines of code remains the same and to me, it's not as evident when the code within the lambda expression is actually executed as with the explicit `if (results == null)` block.

There too many names and both locations and naming are mixed up.\n\nLet's simplify for jena-base.  What you call things in the \"mem\" package is your choice.\n\nIn tuple(t) and function(f) we now have: \n\nTetraConsumer (f), TetraFunction (f), Consumer4 (t), TetraOperator(t), TriConsumer(t), TriFunction(t), TriFunction.TriOperator(t). TriConsumer.Consumer3(t)\n\nThe common naming from other systems like fj (Functional Java), scala is numbering \"F\" and \"Function4\" etc - it's also aligned to the naming of Tuple implementations. Let's use that style and so we do not have concept clashes with RDF. Java has got itself into a bit of a hole on naming and from the consequences of erasure - no need to be restricted by that.\n\n**Proposal 1:**\n\nIn package tuple:\n\n```\n@FunctionalInterface\ninterface TFunction4<X> { void apply(X x1, X x2, X x3, X x4) ; }\n```\n\nand \n\n```\n@FunctionalInterface\ninterface TConsumer4<X,Z> { void accept(X x1, X x2, X x3, X x4) ; }\n```\n\nsame for `TFunction3` and `TConsumer3` and only these.\n\nIt's not a function on a tuple so not `TupleFunctionN`.  `T` keeps away from any future clash with `Function4`, `Consumer4`. We can put discussion of those elsewhere - not needed for this PR.\n\n**Proposal 2:**\n\nHave `function/Function4`, `function/Consumer4`.\n\nThese are the only ones. No Tuple-related all same X forms.\nIf package core/mem wants alias/specializations (and it does not really save very much) it can have them locally, maybe even short names like `F4<X,Z>` for `Function4<X,X,X,X,Z>`.\n\nI much prefer proposal 1 and want leave \"function\" for a different discussion.\n\n**Other**\nIf you want to add lots of `final` in core/mem, so be it. It's almost clutter and the compiler does calculate effectively final nowadays.\n\nIn particular, no final on interface parameters.

Other dataset implementations will not work out so nicely. It will be like two separate datasets and one index will and probably lead to corruption or inconsistent reading (c.f. email [\"transactions and docProducers\"](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jena-users/201601.mbox/%3C568FD70B.8060301%40epimorphics.com%3E)).\n\nOn [JENA-1122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-1122) I summarized discussions up to here as two options suggested:\n1. Internal static state in `TextDatasetFactory` that the same datasets object is returned each time. c.f. TDB's StoreConnection. Extends sharing of text datasets to work with java/API uses but not \"any dataset\" in Fuseki configurations.\n2.

I've updated the pull request implementing all the proposed changes and made a few other minor amendments.\n\nHowever, looking at @afs comments again, I realise I am heading off down the wrong path.  What @afs had suggested was not memoizing the text index objects in TextDataset factory, which is what this PR currently does, but memoizing  dataset objects.\n\nMy bad.  I thought the suggestion was to memoize the TextDataSetLucene objects in TextDatasetFactory.  That does I think solve JENA-1122 (as I understand it) but, as Andy says, it opens up other nasty problems.\n\nSo I propose to switch to memoizing datasets in the assembler.  \n\nI'm sorry the rest of this is so long.  The short version is, what is the best way to go about managing state for memoizing datasets in assemblers?\n\nThe simple option is to just move the code in this pull request for memoizing TextIndexLucene datasets from TextDatasetFactory to TextIndexLuceneAssembler.  That addresses my immediate problem, but a solution that worked for datasets in general would be better.\n\nA problem is if/when/how to clear out the memoized state.\n\nIn use cases where an application or a service starts up, assembles its components and then does what it does until it terminates, there may not be much of an issue leaving state around in the assembler maps used to relate nodes to reusable objects.\n\nIn use cases where an application is repeatedly building and tearing down assemblies during its lifetime then not clearing out the memoizing state can lead to failures when a component is reused between 'builds'.  The current TextIndexLucene test cases do this and they fail if the memoizing map is not cleared out between tests.  Maybe the tests are broken.\n\nThe current code in this pull request clears a TextIndexLucene object out of the memoizingmap when the TextIndexLucene object is closed.  But that is basically a kludge.  I don't think it a good idea to go round changing all existing dataset implementations to support event handling callbacks on close.\n\nThe way I would naturally expect things to work is for assemblers to have some notion of a build.  A build defines a context in which state like the memoizing map can be built up.  The build context can be thrown away at the end of the build and a new one created for the next build.  This would prevent reuse across builds.  So if you do:\n\n  foo = assembler.build(R);\n  bar = assembler.build(R);\n\nyou will get two different assemblies, typically with no sharing between them.  (You would still get a lock failure if R had a TextIndexLucene component that was not closed between creating the two assemblies.)\n\nAs far as I can see assemblers are not designed to work like this.  Nor can I see how to add this notion of a build context without affecting many existing assemblers.

No other system is (legitimately) calling Fuseki service building.  The configuration file processing puts service access points into the server-wide state.  There is no service assembler (it could be done but it isn't, it serves no purpose); it is done by custom processing during walking the datastructure which is happening anyway.\n\nIn the Fuseki case, we want shared datasets descriptions, that is, same name, to yield the same dataset.  Processing dataset descriptions is driven by assemblers and they have names for keys using the root resource.  A general \"dataset sharing\" outside assemblers is hard because of the lack of key. In other cases, I can imagine that a shared description alone does not always imply a shared object - in-memory datasets for example.  The more general area is not clearly defined.\n\nThe solution I see is that Fuseki handles the process step for the link:\n\n---\n\n```\n    fuseki:dataset   <#dataset>\n\n<#dataset> rdf:type ja:RDFDataset(OrSubType)\n```\n\n---\n\nThis happens in `Builder.buildDataService` as it calls `Assembler.general.open(datasetDesc)`.\n\nIt looks to me that if sharing is provided  here, the problem statement of JENA-1122 is addressed.\n\nOne matter arising: \n\nService descriptions can be in multiple files (it is the preferred pattern to use `configuration/`). The template system behind the UI uses relative URIs so names of descriptions are unique across the server.  \n\nIf a user manually writes two configuration files, but uses the same absolute URI and they meant it to be different, we have a problem and this could be made to cause an error (safe choice to force shared datasets to be in the server `config.ttl`).\n\n`FusekiConfig.initializeDataAccessPoints` is the driver, it calls `readConfigurationDirectory` and the others places service descriptions can be and so needs checking.\n\nFor now, just solving this for two services in the server configuration file, with entries in the `fuseki:services` list links is a good start.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/177246334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/177312482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/120#issuecomment-177312482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/120","id":177312482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NzMxMjQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-30T21:43:51Z","updated_at":"2016-01-30T21:43:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Merged after fixing up:\n\n1/ I used \"git pull --no-commit\" and got some compile errors (imports of `TriOperator.Operator3` etc) in files `SimpleMap*`.

Now that model may may be stateless views of datasets, the notion of \"close\" is not so clear cut. It certainly does not close the dataset. That is what I think is being captured in \"Not all implementations of Model require this method to be called.\"\n\nFor `CloseableIterator` is the root of lots of iterator types in Jena, not just StmtIterator and the otehr API-related iterators. Looks to me if the javadoc is expressing situations that are not happening in practice anymore.  There was, a long time ago, a BDB backed storage (C-BDB) and that needed iterator closed so DB cursors were released.\n\nIterators like `ExtendedIterator<Triple>` get combined, concatenated, filtered, and mapped and don't fit the `try` block style so well.  I added `AutoCloseable` and got about 700 warnings from the codebase.\n\nSo the question must be what impact on everyone's existing applications will there be?  A whole bunch of warnings turning up has to be considered in deciding here.\n\nJena supports different APIs over the same core.
