@kayousterhout @markhamstra @mateiz @pwendell , I just committed the supervisor-based solution, it should work as expected (the supervised crashes due to an exception, suspends itself, supervisor gets what happened, clears everything and kills the child) \n\nthe next problem here is how to test the fault tolerance logic, according to my understanding on Akka testkit, we have to declare the supervisor as a class to test its internal logic (this involves moving some functions from DAGScheduler to the new class), my concern here is that 0.9.1 is just a maintenance release, do we really want to change so much here?

the way - for a while I was really confused how your original patch actually fixed this problem. I eventually realized that the issue is that the `DAGScheduler` itself is an actor, so in this case where the `Executor` was running in the same JVM, also within an actor, it was resetting the class loader in the thread that the DAGScheduler runs in. So the DAGScheduler got a `Foo` object back from the task and it tried to put it into an array of `Foo` objects, but when deserializing the `Foo` from the task it was using the `replClassLoader` back from the `Executor` which, because delegation was not properly set-up, had defined `Foo` for itself.\n\nMaybe this is what you meant earlier - it took me some effort to piece it all

What's required to set it up? This is a pretty major piece of functionality and it would be good to test it by default.\n\nIt requires to run Tachyon locally to set it up.\n\nI totally agree to test it by default. Tachyon has a local cluster mode for testing. But it is in the test jar, which will be release from Tachyon 0.5.0. The current unit test has been tested locally. How about let's modify this to use TachyonLocalClusterMode after from 0.5.0 release?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38775628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38775654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/252#issuecomment-38775654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/252","id":38775654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzc1NjU0","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-27T07:33:20Z","updated_at":"2014-03-27T07:33:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Merged build triggered.
