Thanks so much for detailed review. I have addressed most of the comments in the updated patch. The main remaining issues are 1) whether we should invoke `ReplicaManager.handleLogDirFailure()` in `LogManager.handleLogDirFailure()` and 2) whether/how we can handle `IOException` in the methods of `TransactionStateManager`. I have provided explanation under the corresponding comments.\r\n\r\nBTW, there is one comment regarding a line in `Partition.scala` that can only be replied in
