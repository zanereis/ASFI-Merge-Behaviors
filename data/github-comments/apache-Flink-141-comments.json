I just changed everything and rebased to the current master. \r\n\r\nSome notable changes:\r\n- The `StreamIterationCheckpointingITCase` is now made deterministic, it fails on-purpose after the first successful checkpoint for just once and the job stops a bit after everything has been recovered appropriately (records in transit in feedback and operator states). \r\n- I am now using `ListState` which is supposed to work like a charm with the rocksdb file backend. Note that with the default in-memory backend there is a high chance to get \"too large snapshot size\" exceptions given the low memory capacity that it is given by default.\r\n- One tricky part that can be potentially done better is the way I set the logger in the StreamIterationHead. Also had to make checkpointing methods protected to access them through the StreamIterationHead without much of a hustle. Better alternatives are welcome.\r\n\r\nWhenever you find time go ahead and check it out.

Gabor, \r\n\r\nI like the idea of having a RankingScore, it seems like having that hierarchy with Score, RankingScore and PairWiseScore gives us the flexibility we need to include ranking and supervised learning evaluation under the same umbrella.\r\n\r\nI would also encourage sharing any other ideas you broached that might break the API, this is still very much an evolving project and there is no need to shoehorn everything into an `evaluate(test: TestType): DataSet[Double]` function if there are better alternatives.\r\n\r\nOne thing we need to consider is how this affects cross-validation and model selection/hyper-parameter tuning. These two aspects of the library are tightly linked and I think that we'll need to work on them in parallel to find issues that affect both.\r\n\r\nI recommend taking a look at the [cross-validation PR](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/891) I had opened way back when, and make a new WIP PR that uses the current one (#2838) as a basis. Since the `Score` interface still exists it shouldn't require many changes, and all that's added is the CrossValidation class. There are other fundamental issues with the sampling there we can discuss in due time.\r\n\r\nRegarding the RankingPredictor we should consider the usecase of such an interface. Is it only going to be used for recommendation? If yes, what are the cases where we could build a Pipeline with current or future pre-processing steps?

For the question I'm afraid I can't be of much help, I'll read the relevant paper this week and get back to you if I have any more comments.\r\n\r\n1. Don't know enough about joins to answer this :/\r\n2. For this we would need to test the two solutions you have proposed and evaluate the performance. You have listed a couple of pros/cons there, maybe you can elaborate?\r\n3. If there is absolutely no benefit from using more blocks I don't see the need to investigate further. We'll need to include these instructions in the docs.\r\n4. I think test hardening should be done in a different PRs (potentially for more algorithms). For now manual tests should suffice.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I should also mention that this type of non-overlapping blocking is very useful for other optimization problems (see e.g. [LightLDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1576v1.pdf)) and I would very much like to include it as a generalized

No problem. Some performance evaluations might help us in this case too. I don't believe it should have much effect on the performance anyway as a 3-way join is only used outside the iteration.\r\n2. I really like the idea of doing a performance evaluation! I'm not exactly sure how to do this with a `join` instead of a `coGroup`, so let me sketch an implementation before elaborating on the pros/cons. (It was more straightforward to use `coGroup`.)\r\n3. The benefit of using more blocks is to use less memory, just as in the ALS algorithm, with the disadvantage of using more network. However, more blocks here means much more network and bookkeeping compared to ALS, because there are more Flink iterations. I've investigated this a bit more and found that the main \"bottleneck\" is the maximum size of the sort-buffer, which was around 100 MB with around 40 GB TaskManager memory, and large matrix blocks do not fit in. So even given enough memory, we cannot use large blocks. Unfortunately we cannot configure the maximum size of the sort-buffer, and I would not like to change the underlying code in the core or runtime, but I tried a workaround which might work (splitting the factor blocks to subblocks). I'll just need to run some measurements. If this workaround turns out fine, then it should be okay to go on with this and give instructions in the docs.\r\n4.

It's at least confusing to have both, but it might not be worth to expose the one giving `(Prediction,Prediction)` pairs to the user as it only *prepares* evaluation. With introducing the evaluation framework, we could at least rename it to something like `preparePairwiseEvaluation(test: TestType): DataSet[(Prediction,Prediction)]`. In the ranking case we might generalize it to `prepareEvaluation(test: TestType): PreparedTesting`. We basically did this with the `PrepareDataSetOperation`, we've just left the old `evaluate` as it is for now. I suggest to change this if we can break the API.\r\n\r\nI'll do a rebase on the cross-validation PR. At first glance, it should not really be a problem to do both cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning, as the user has to provide a `Scorer` anyway. A minor issue I see is the user falling back to a default `score` (e.g. RMSE in case of ALS). This might not be a problem for recommendation models that give rating predictions beside ranking predictions, but it's a problem for models that *only* give ranking predictions, because those do not extend the `Predictor` class. This is not an issue for now, but might be a problem when adding more recommendation models. Should we try and do this now or is it a bit \"overengineering\"? I'll see if any other problem comes up with after rebasing.\r\n\r\nThe `RankingPredictor` interface is useful *internally* for the `Score`s. It serves a contract between a `RankingScore` and the model. I'm sure it will be used only for recommendations, but it's no effort exposing it, so the user can write code using a general `RankingPredictor` (although I would not think this is what users would like to do :) ). A better question is whether to use it in a `Pipeline`. We discussed this with some people, and could not really find a use-case where we need a `Transformer`-like preprocessing for recommendations. Of course, there could be other preprocessing steps, such as removing/aggregating duplicates, but those do not have to be `fit` to training data. Based on this, it's not worth the effort to integrate `RankingPredictor` with the `Pipeline`, at least for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/262783401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/262783448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2439#issuecomment-262783448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2439","id":262783448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjc4MzQ0OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-24T14:04:12Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T14:04:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!\r\n\r\nYou can squash commits by rebasing.
