Support both ubuntu14 and ubuntu16\r\nMake the following scripts work out of the box on unbuntu14 or unbunt16.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/tree/master/tools/ubuntu-setup/\r\n```\r\ntools/ubuntu-setup/ansible.sh\r\ntools/ubuntu-setup/docker.sh\r\ntools/ubuntu-setup/java8.sh\r\ntools/ubuntu-setup/misc.sh\r\ntools/ubuntu-setup/pip.sh\r\ntools/ubuntu-setup/scala.sh\r\n```\r\n### 2. Version of docker engine 1.12\r\nCurrently we only support docker 1.12\r\nUpdate `tools/ubuntu-setup/docker.sh`  that by default install docker 1.12 on both (ubuntu14/16), for those that want to experiment on their own, allow via environment variable to override this and instead use latest version of docker.\r\n\r\n### 3. Have a way to test it\r\nI think there could be 2 options:\r\n1. Setup Travis to run in matrix running in parallel ubunt14 and ubunt16\r\n2. Update Vagrant deployment to use ubunt16\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/366864213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/366870992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3301#issuecomment-366870992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3301","id":366870992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Njg3MDk5Mg==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T05:29:07Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T05:29:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG4

Some changes too a lot more than one repo (eg an API change might affect runtime SDKs and the CLIs, or a runtime change will touch all the runtime repos).

development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/367208768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/367208889","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/3315#issuecomment-367208889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3315","id":367208889,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzIwODg4OQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T04:19:56Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T04:20:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```\r\n>
