looks pretty promising!! However why do every DStream need to change? The DStream parent class can do the following. Before calling compute(), it can store the previous callsite, and set the new callsite, and then call compute. Upon returning from compute(), it can reset the previous callsite.  As far as I can see, that should work for all the DStreams without modifying every single stream.\n\nAlso can you show us a new screenshot of what it looks like now.
