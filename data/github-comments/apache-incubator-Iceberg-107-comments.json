So the binlog is not first shipped to Kafka first here, right? Flink CDC source directly read binlog from MySQL?\r\n\r\nYes, you are right, flink-cdc-connector will directly read binlog from MySQL.\r\n\r\n> Personally, I don't see too much benefit of just scale up the parallelism for the IcebergStreamWriter operator. All the extra network shuffle/rebalance can be expensive too. I do see the need to scale up the job parallelism with higher traffic. hence I am wondering if we can also scale up the Flink CDC source operator along with other operators so that we can keep the chaining behavior.\r\n\r\nActually I encountered this problem when I scale up the job parallelism, and that is the Case2 above. In some situation, we can not scale up the cdc source opr, such as flink-cdc-connector the source parallelism will always be 1. And I don't think we should not depend on keep src parallelism equal to FlinkSink to guarantee result correctness.\r\n\r\n> As you said already, this only works if the hash shuffle (based on the primary key) is the only network shuffle before the IcebergStreamWriter operator. That is why I have some reservations of putting this in the Flink Iceberg sink. This won't work if there is some other network shuffle before the Flink sink, which is outside of the control of the sink. Hence I am wondering if this should be handled outside of the Flink sink and we should just document the expected behavior of the input data to the Flink Iceberg sink.\r\n\r\nIn CDC case, ff there is some other network shuffle(not base on the primary key) before the FlinkSink, that will lead to cdc record disorder, and yes, we could not get the correct result, because that is out of the control of the FlinkSink. But I think that is user's fault, in CDC case, user should make sure cdc data order correct and send to downstream. \r\n\r\nBesides, we should also to consider the flink default network shuffle and could not manually control network shuffle(such as FlinkSQL, we could not easily to control network shuffle between two opr) before the FlinkSink situation. I think that is Iceberg should resolve, and don't need user to do this manually. User only need to setting correct `equalityFieldColumns` and send cdc/upsert data to FlinkSink, and Iceberg will handle the rest of the work well. @stevenzwu ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903093340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903094697","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2898#issuecomment-903094697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2898","id":903094697,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8411CGp","user":{"login":"Reo-LEI","id":17312872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyODcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17312872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI","html_url":"https://github.com/Reo-LEI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reo-LEI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-21T10:15:55Z","updated_at":"2021-08-21T10:15:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @Reo-LEI I left a comment in the issue #2918.

I got the problem and motivation for this change. \r\n\r\n> Case2: x != y == z\r\n\r\nThis PR change the parallelism of of the upstream operator to force x=y. To me, it is dangerous for FlinkSink to modify sth that doesn't own. It violates the principle of ownership/isolation. I would argue that for the CDC upsert case, job parallelism should be set to the CDC source parallelism (x). It doesn't make sense to have a different job parallelism (y) than CDC source parallelism (x). and then have the FlinkSink to do some magic to override the parallelism of an upstream operator that it doesn't own.\r\n\r\n> Case3: x == y != z\r\n\r\nThis can happen if we need an higher parallelism for the Flink writer. I can see that we may want to handle this case in the FlinkSink. I am wondering if we should add a new `equalityKeysHash`  to the `DistributionMode`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am personally not sure how valuable this setup will be. This assumes that Flink writers are the bottleneck and the job throughput can improve significantly with higher Iceberg writer parallelism.\r\n\r\n> Case4: x != y != z\r\n\r\nit 's a combination of 2 and 3. so individual arguments apply separately here.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903407782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903412789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2527#issuecomment-903412789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2527","id":903412789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8412Pw1","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T03:22:45Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T03:22:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Spark 3.2 is coming (RC phase now), does Iceberg have a timeline for Spark 3.2 support?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903412789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903461057","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2527#issuecomment-903461057","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2527","id":903461057,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8412bjB","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T05:46:05Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T05:46:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We will start the work for supporting Spark 3.2 as soon as it is available.

The fact that it picks up spark_catalog correctly does mean it at least read that property correctly and independently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903851627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903903645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3012#issuecomment-903903645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3012","id":903903645,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8414Hmd","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T16:01:26Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T16:01:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@moon-fall, can you please add a description for this PR?\r\n\r\nAlso, it looks like this changes the intended behavior.

agree with much of what @rymurr said. I think it is good that snapshots are immutable. I think of the tags (and later, branches) feature as a way of referring to snapshots and keeping track of them, just like references in git.\r\n\r\nFor the spec, what I've been thinking is to add a new map that tracks snapshots with names as keys and an object of data. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"named-snapshots\": {\r\n    \"current\": { \"snapshot-id\": 1234..., \"type\": \"branch\" },\r\n    \"dev\": { \"snapshot-id\": 1235..., \"type\": \"branch\" },\r\n    \"monthly-2021-06-01\": { \"snapshot-id\": 1233..., \"type\": \"tag\", \"lifecycle\": \"snapshot\" },\r\n    \"audit-2021-q2\": { \"snapshot-id\": 1232..., \"type\": \"tag\", \"lifecycle\": \"independent\" }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThings to note about this example:\r\n* The current version is a normal branch. We'd need to keep `current-version-id` until v3\r\n* The \"type\" determines what can be done. Branches can be updated just like \"current\" and tags are static\r\n* Tags need information about lifecycle. Some tags are just convenience names that should be removed when a snapshot is expired (lifecycle=snapshot) but others are snapshots that should be retained forever (lifecycle=independent)\r\n* Using a JSON object for the tag/branch metadata allows us to evolve it more easily, unlike `map<string, long>`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903937976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903950996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2961#issuecomment-903950996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2961","id":903950996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8414TKU","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T17:02:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T17:02:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue thanks for the suggestion!\r\n\r\nOne thing around the immutable nature of snapshot I thought about is that, in encryption we still have the need to add the ability to rotate key. The encryption metadata or its location will likely be a part of snapshot which will change after rotation. This goes to the point I was discussing above, I think snapshot content is of course immutable, but I am not sure if we can continue to keep properties describing the snapshot immutable.\r\n\r\nFor lifecycle, yes I was thinking about adding this as a part of a Tag object, but if we go with placing it in table metadata it will be the way you described.\r\n\r\nFor JSON object instead of map, yes If it is in table metadata it will be an object similar to how we implement other fields. I was just trying to simplify the idea.\r\n\r\nFor the branch example you gave, could you elaborate more about its semantics and usage? I don't see how it would be used without having a complete DAG of commits, and how its relationship would be with the Nessie project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/903950996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/904162653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3008#issuecomment-904162653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3008","id":904162653,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8415G1d","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T22:01:14Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T22:01:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can you also remove the site deploy tasks from gradle since this replaces them?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/904162653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/904180068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3014#issuecomment-904180068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3014","id":904180068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX8415LFk","user":{"login":"xinbinhuang","id":27927454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI3NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27927454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T22:35:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T22:35:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@RussellSpitzer can you assign this to me, and timebox it till Thursday?

My understanding is that most features needed to support this is not implemented in Iceberg yet, and Spark SQL extension is typically the last step after everything is ready.\r\n> \r\n> I was pulled to first focus on the Trino and PrestoDB Iceberg connector work in the past few months so I did not follow up too much on this area, do we already have all the building pieces to make this work? If not, I would propose we focus on those aspects first before adding the SQL extension, as the syntax might change if the base implementation changes.\r\n\r\n@huaxingao as you mentioned that your next planned PR is to add the implementation, do you want to create one PR that has both of them (i.e. this work and the work from the next PR), and then create a separate PR for the work needed to implement it? That way you can more easily test this end to end (and keep the work you have), but ensure that we have the building blocks in place to do this (in case any syntax changes or anything are needed as @jackye1995 mentioned).\r\n\r\nWe can then have a working end to end implementation, to satisfy any concerns about any potential missing pieces, and use this PR as the last PR that's merged in (you can keep this branch as the main branch for demoing both PRs if you'd like).\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents on a path forward to continue your work on this while considering Jack's concern 🙂 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/906126358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/906136723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2826#issuecomment-906136723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2826","id":906136723,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842AoyT","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-26T06:38:36Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T06:38:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Do we need to check in `gradle-wrapper.jar`?

is a part of the optimized logical plan for a TPC-DS query (q18) on V1 tables:\r\n```\r\n+- Project [c_customer_sk#50, c_current_cdemo_sk#52, c_current_addr_sk#54, c_birth_year#63], Statistics(sizeInBytes=2.7 MiB)\r\n   +- Filter (((c_birth_month#62 IN (1,6,8,9,12,2) AND isnotnull(c_customer_sk#50)) AND isnotnull(c_current_cdemo_sk#52)) AND isnotnull(c_current_addr_sk#54)),

parquet, Statistics(sizeInBytes=25.5 MiB)\r\n```\r\nThe customer table is 25.5 MiB but the Project plan (4 columns of the 18 columns of the customer table) is small enough to be broadcast.\r\nHere is the equivalent snippet for Iceberg tables before this change:\r\n```\r\n+- Project [c_customer_sk#59, c_current_cdemo_sk#61, c_current_addr_sk#63, c_birth_year#72], Statistics(sizeInBytes=21.9

rowCount=5.00E+5)\r\n```\r\nA read schema of 5 columns has already been pushed down to the Iceberg customer table, but the statistics for it is the full 25.5 MiB for the table. Consequently, the Project plan, which is estimated basically using the ratio of the size of the 4 columns to the size of the 5 columns times the 25.5 MiB, is too big to be broadcast.\r\nWith this change, the equivalent snippet becomes:\r\n```\r\n+- Project [c_customer_sk#59, c_current_cdemo_sk#61, c_current_addr_sk#63, c_birth_year#72], Statistics(sizeInBytes=2.0 MiB)\r\n   +- Filter (((c_birth_month#71 IN (1,6,8,9,12,2) AND isnotnull(c_customer_sk#59)) AND isnotnull(c_current_cdemo_sk#61)) AND isnotnull(c_current_addr_sk#63)), Statistics(sizeInBytes=2.4 MiB)\r\n      +- RelationV2[c_customer_sk#59, c_current_cdemo_sk#61, c_current_addr_sk#63, c_birth_month#71, c_birth_year#72] spark_catalog.tpcds_10_iceberg.customer, Statistics(sizeInBytes=2.4 MiB, rowCount=5.00E+5)\r\n```\r\nHere the statistics for the Iceberg customer table is adjusted according to read schema and is now 2.4 MiB, and the estimate for the Project adjusts it by the ratio of the size of the 4 columns to the size of the 5 columns, making it 2.0 MiB, and it can be broadcast.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/906932513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/906975677","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3030#issuecomment-906975677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3030","id":906975677,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842D1m9","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T07:03:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T07:03:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I absolutely agree with you that flaky tests should be treated like bugs.
