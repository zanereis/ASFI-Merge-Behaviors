This way we can leave the leaf stage untouched.\r\n\r\n@61yao no it isn't, I tried that for the initial PR but we generate data schemas based on the result of the calcite logical plan. I tried hacking calcite to allow that behavior and it gets really brittle (it complains during the validation phase that the expected schema and the operator schema don't match up)\r\n\r\nalso, fwiw, I think Calcite is right here. Each logical node should be correct independently - we shouldn't make assumptions about the physical execution when building the logical plan.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1324225162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1324271076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9840#issuecomment-1324271076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9840","id":1324271076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5O7sXk","user":{"login":"KKcorps","id":5559703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTk3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5559703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps","html_url":"https://github.com/KKcorps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-22T21:42:43Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T21:42:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed.

I think this works because, the LHS is of type DOUBLE and hence `BaseRawValueBasedPredicateEvaluator.newRawValueBasedEvaluator` converts all IN clause values into DOUBLE and converting any numerical value to DOUBLE is a valid conversion in Pinot.\r\n\r\nHowever, `select runs from baseballStats where runs IN (310.0, 300.0)` fails in `ColumnValueSegmentPruner.pruneInPredicate` because LHS is an INT column and we can't convert 310.0 and 300.0 to INT.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1324397213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1324399426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9820#issuecomment-1324399426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9820","id":1324399426,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5O8LtC","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-23T00:27:31Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T00:27:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Not all expressions work though.

The key is setting pinot.set.instance.id.to.hostname to true.\r\n\r\nHere is what I did to ensure that controller/broker/server id's were not based on IP address, but set tot the hostname:\r\n1 Use config files for starting controller/broker/server. For example, here are my commands from the kube yaml:\r\n- pinot-admin.sh StartController -configFileName /pinot-config/pinot-controller.conf\r\n- pinot-admin.sh StartBroker -clusterName pinot -zkAddress zookeeper:2181 -configFileName /pinot-config/pinot-broker.conf\r\n- pinot-admin.sh StartServer -clusterName pinot -zkAddress zookeeper:2181 -configFileName /pinot-config/pinot-server.conf\r\n\r\n2. Set pinot.set.instance.id.to.hostname to true in pinot-controller.conf, pinot-broker.conf, and pinot-server.conf.

Some design decision are quite different to what someone using ByteBuffers or LArrays would expect (which is even worse when the methods are not properly documented), some features are not present (like copying to a ByteBuffer from a given offset), some others are not consistent (https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Bytes/issues/478), some mistakes derive in the JVM been killed, etc. I think it is an amazing library, but it is not maintained as a generic byte buffer library but very focused on how people from OpenHFT use it, which I totally understand but would require some time inversion from us to be able to use it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I've been trying to understand why LArray cannot be used in Java 17 and it seems to be related to the way @xerial creates ByteBuffers views. To do so, LArray uses a private constructor that has changed from in Java 17: A new parameter has been added. Xerial has already dealt with that issue [here](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-java/commit/117f1612fc3c08741a8acb159e52aa5d29c50988) so I think it is feasible to do it in LArray. That would be fantastic because it would allow us to run with modern JVMs without needing to change a bit of code.\r\n\r\nI'm still thinking that a proper Foreign Memory Access API (like JEP-424](https://openjdk.org/jeps/424)) is the way to go, but given that the solution is still not stable, the best we can do is to help Xerial to update his library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1327130548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1327503220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9812#issuecomment-1327503220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9812","id":1327503220,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5PIBd0","user":{"login":"vmarchaud","id":2820968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MjA5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2820968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud","html_url":"https://github.com/vmarchaud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmarchaud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-25T13:54:01Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T13:54:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Jackie-Jiang Thanks for the quick fix !

Since we are emitting the delay metric per (table, merge level) pair, I think that we need to compute `maxValidBucketEndTimeMs` for each merge level.\r\n> \r\n> @jtao15 Can you double check on this?\r\n\r\n1/ If we double check the previous logic (https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-plugins/pinot-minion-tasks/pinot-minion-builtin-tasks/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/plugin/minion/tasks/mergerollup/MergeRollupTaskGenerator.java#L628), only the lowest merge level `maxValidBucketEndTimeMs` was used to calculate the lowest merge level bucket delay. For higher levels, we use the lower level status to calculate bucket delay.\r\n\r\n2/ If 1 is true, we only need to calculate `maxValidBucketEndTimeMs` for the lowest level, and we should not reuse the same structure `_tableMaxValidBucketEndTimeMs` to keep `maxValidBucketEndTimeMs` for different merge levels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1329444914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1329478992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/9867#issuecomment-1329478992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/9867","id":1329478992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5PPj1Q","user":{"login":"walterddr","id":3581352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODEzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3581352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr","html_url":"https://github.com/walterddr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walterddr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-28T17:33:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T17:34:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1. could you run explain plan and paste the result plan?
