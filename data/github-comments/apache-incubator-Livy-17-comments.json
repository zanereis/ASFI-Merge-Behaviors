had some issues with using ZooKeeper as a recovery method. When one of the zookeepers is not up in Kubernetes, its address is not published (i.e. there is none), and thus Livy cannot determine the zookeeper host. With the current version of ZooKeeper, Livy crashes because of a bug in ZooKeeper client. This has been fixed though in more recent versions (3.5.2+): [ZOOKEEPER-1576](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.2-alpha/releasenotes.html).\r\n\r\nIn short, Livy cannot start if 2 out of 3 ZooKeepers are up at the moment, even though it should be able to do so.
