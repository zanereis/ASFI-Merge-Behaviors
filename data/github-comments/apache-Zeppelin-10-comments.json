Maven's `<dependency>...</dependency>` and code like `import com.mysql.*` doesn't violate the rules, so it is safe to have it in Apache sources.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/129855077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/129947130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/203#issuecomment-129947130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/203","id":129947130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTk0NzEzMA==","user":{"login":"Madhuka","id":1180128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODAxMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1180128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka","html_url":"https://github.com/Madhuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madhuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-11T16:01:08Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T16:01:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"###

could you please elaborate on the added-value of this interpreter? \nIt seems it tries to unify the JDBC URL syntax for different drivers  Do you really want to do this? IMHO it is not a good practice to hide the driver specific options and conventions. \nAlso can't you achieve the same goal using one of the existing SQL interpreters like  Postgresql or Phoenix to name some. If you add the desired driver jar to some of those interpreters and set the driver name and jdbc url through the provided properties would you be able to query any of the above mentioned DBs?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/131638409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/131641869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/211#issuecomment-131641869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/211","id":131641869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMTY0MTg2OQ==","user":{"login":"randerzander","id":1692914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTI5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1692914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander","html_url":"https://github.com/randerzander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randerzander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-16T23:48:18Z","updated_at":"2015-08-16T23:48:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"a generic JDBC Interpreter with good property features may reduce the number of interpreters required in Zeppelin.\n\nLooks like Postgres, Phoenix, Hive, Ignite, & Tajo could all work with a generic JDBC driver.\n\nIf custom code is needed for a JDBC driver, it could be added to a JDBC-extensions module instead of creating new top level Interpreters for every Zeppelin interface using JDBC.

Thanks for the feedback. A validator is important to determine the data maps to the schema without any errors beforehand. Yes it is complicated but I will write more simpler manner so that everybody can understand. It's not an interpreter. It's useful for users as well as for developers. Users can use the validator before visualization to check if the data is in accordance with the data model. It will not break and the user can take the right decision.
