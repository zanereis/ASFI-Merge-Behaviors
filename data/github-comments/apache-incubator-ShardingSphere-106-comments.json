All the SQL cases which have the error assertion results are our targets to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix the above assertion results?\r\n1. Look at the exception log and find the corresponding `SQL Case ID` and `SQL`.\r\n2. Find out the `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` in `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sql/dml`\r\n3. Calculate the correct `start-index` and `stop-index` of `literal-expression` segment of this `SQL`.\r\n4. Add the calculated `start-index` and `stop-index` labels of `literal-expression` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID`, like\r\n```\r\n            <literal-expression value=\"init\" start-index=\"10\" stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the correct `literal-start-index` and `literal-stop-index` of `literal-expression` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` when it is necessary, like\r\n```\r\n            <literal-expression value=\"init\" literal-start-index=\"10\" literal-stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n6. Run `SQLParserParameterizedTest` again to check whether this `SQL Case ID` does not stay in the list of `SQL` with  `bad assertion result`.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n1. What is the definition of `literal-expression`?\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a SQL,\r\n> select * from tb where id = 1 or id =?\r\n\r\nThe value of `1` is a `LiteralExpressionSegment`, on the other hand, `?` is a `ParameterMarkerExpression `.\r\n\r\n2. What is the difference between `literal-start-index` and `start-index`?\r\n\r\nWhen a SQL does not contain parameter maker, i.e.,`?`, this SQL only has one form; Otherwise, you will see two forms of this SQL, i.e, a SQL form filled with parameter and a SQL form only with parameter marks. For instance,\r\n```\r\nCase1 One SQL without parameter mark,\r\nselect * from table where id = 1;\r\n\r\nCase2 One SQL with parameter mark,\r\nOriginal SQL: select * from table where id = ?;\r\nSQL filled with Parameter: select * from table where id = 1;\r\n```\r\nReplace `the parameter mark` with `the actual parameter` will change the position of the segment. Therefore we need to add `start-index` to represent the start position of a segment for `Original SQL`, and `literal-start-index` is used to represent the start position of a segment for `SQL filled with Parameter`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/599462168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/599469446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4782#issuecomment-599469446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/4782","id":599469446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTQ2OTQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-16T10:50:28Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T10:50:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### How to find the targets to be fixed?\r\n1. Open class `ExpressionAssert` and clear the comment of `SQLSegmentAssert.assertIs(assertContext, actual, expected)` in `assertCommonExpression`.\r\n2. run `SQLParserParameterizedTest`\r\n3. All the SQL cases which have the error assertion results are our targets to be fixed.\r\n\r\n### How to fix the above assertion results?\r\n1. Look at the exception log and find the corresponding `SQL Case ID` and `SQL`.\r\n2. Find out the `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` in `./incubator-shardingsphere/shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-test/src/test/resources/sql/dml`\r\n3. Calculate the correct `start-index` and `stop-index` of `common-expression` segment of this `SQL`.\r\n4. Add the calculated `start-index` and `stop-index` labels of `common-expression` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID`, like\r\n```\r\n            <common-expression text=\"VALUES(status)\"  start-index=\"10\" stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n5. Add the correct `literal-start-index` and `literal-stop-index` of `common-expression` segment to `parsing result` of this `SQL Case ID` when it is necessary, like\r\n```\r\n            <common-expression text=\"VALUES(status)\" literal-start-index=\"10\" literal-stop-index=\"11\" />\r\n```\r\n6. Run `SQLParserParameterizedTest` again to check whether this `SQL Case ID` does not stay in the list of `SQL` with  `bad assertion result`.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\n1. What is the definition of `common-expression`?\r\n`common-expression` means an expression that contains a function or a calculated expression.\r\n\r\nFor instance, here is a SQL,\r\n> INSERT INTO t_order_item (item_id, order_id, user_id, status, creation_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'insert', now())\r\n\r\nThe value of `now()` is a `LiteralExpressionSegment`.\r\n> INSERT INTO t_order (t_order.order_id, t_order.user_id, t_order.status) VALUES (?, ?, ?) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE t_order.status = VALUES(t_order.status)\r\n\r\nThis example shows the value of `VALUES(t_order.status)` is a `LiteralExpressionSegment`.\r\n\r\n2. What is the difference between `literal-start-index` and `start-index`?\r\n\r\nWhen a SQL does not contain parameter maker, i.e.,`?`, this SQL only has one form; Otherwise, you will see two forms of this SQL, i.e, a SQL form filled with parameter and a SQL form only with parameter marks. For instance,\r\n```\r\nCase1 One SQL without parameter mark,\r\nselect * from table where id = 1;\r\n\r\nCase2 One SQL with parameter mark,\r\nOriginal SQL: select * from table where id = ?;\r\nSQL filled with Parameter: select * from table where id = 1;\r\n```\r\nReplace `the parameter mark` with `the actual parameter` will change the position of the segment.
