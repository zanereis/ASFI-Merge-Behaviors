That being said, I'm currently thinking of a new approach for the command sequencer because having implemented the live migration, the non-parallel commands isn't optimal at all when you have long running sequential commands on a hypervisor. And I tend to think that's the reason behind your PR, isn't it?\r\n\r\nYes, thats right.\r\n\r\n> The way it's currently done is too simple (if a job cannot be run in parallel on the HV, it will put in \r\n> So don't you think we're better of rewriting the sequencer to let more commands being executed in parallel to avoid this bottleneck on the AgentAttache? It would normally make the cancellation not needed in the way you implemented it since less jobs will be queued.\r\n> \r\n\r\nAs you already said, with todays design it isn't possible. Rewriting is obviously better. But, thats a bigger job. In the current design, this was the only possible way to allow cloudstack to process queued up jobs.\r\n\r\n> If we wish to be able to cancel a job, IMHO it should cancel the job down on the hypervisor too, thus clearing normally the resources involved as if the execution didn't go well.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI agree.

We have seen that `/etc/cloudstack/ips.json` on the router has IPs on them that aren't cleaned up. Since #1907 is now merged, I'm worried that the changes in this PR will not play well with #1908.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we have seen that IPs left over in the `ips.json` file can be stuck on `\"add\": true` even if the IP is no longer on the account. \r\n\r\nThus, the code that was added in PR #1907 concerns me:\r\n\r\n```\r\n if not address['add'] and not ip.configured():\r\n    logging.info(\"Skipping %s as the add flag is set to %s \" % (address['public_ip'], address['add']))\r\n    continue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `if` condition fails in a case we've been investigating. Because our IP is `\"add\": true`, but `configured()` returns `False`, the IP gets reconfigured anyway. This doesn't add the IP to the router's interface, but it _does_ run an `arping` command (see CsAddress.py). Essentially, if this PR is merged as-is, we might wind up with a regression on CLOUDSTACK-9500. \r\n\r\nI will do a bit of manual testing combining both #1908 and #1907 to see what happens. It may just be that after restarting the network (and thus cleaning the router), these issues will vanish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/283033345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/283033601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1813#issuecomment-283033601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1813","id":283033601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzAzMzYwMQ==","user":{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T13:05:45Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T13:05:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks
