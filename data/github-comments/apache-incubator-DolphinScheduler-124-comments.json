that the exception is No Node (dead_server), this node will be set only by master startup. If the master is started after the worker, then there will be this error. So we may need to set these nodes as registry properties, i.e. all nodes that interface to the registry will set this node by default (not just master).\r\n\r\nBut now I'm not sure if this is the problem.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring page on the interface has no data returned from the backend for now, we discuss on the mailing list whether we need to remove it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/865726050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/865832673","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/5681#issuecomment-865832673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5681","id":865832673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTgzMjY3Mw==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-22T09:42:23Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T09:42:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
