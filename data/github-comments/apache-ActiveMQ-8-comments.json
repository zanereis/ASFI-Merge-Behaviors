E.g receive from a 5.x broker and publish using the same message object to another type of broker...could be due to communicating with different teams, companies, or handling a system transition, etc.\r\n> \r\n> As part of that process if the other provider is actually a JMS 2 client, it will try to stamp the JMSDeliveryTime on the original message object like its meant to. It may have handled the method not being implemented at all on JMS 1.x message objects since thats not so unexpected due to spec transition, but will likely fail if the method actually exists but simply throws UOE as thats unexpected.\r\n\r\n@gemmellr yeah, so tricky corner of the JMS API. This trips up a lot of folks that are new to JMS-- the setDeliveryDelay can only be honored when set on the MessageProducer object. Any code that calls it on the Message is not valid per the spec. \r\n\r\n```\r\n7.9 Message Delivery Delay\r\n\r\nAn application may specify the required delivery delay using the method \r\nsetDeliveryDelay on the producer object. This sets the delivery delay of \r\nall messages sent using that producer. Note however that the \r\nsetDeliveryDelay method on Message cannot be used to set the \r\ndelivery delay of a message.\r\n``` \r\n\r\nFor the JMS bridge idea, I can't walk a scenario where would be _actually_ problematic. This feels hypothetical as it has a chicken-and-egg problem. The JMS API doesn't define how message data is hydrated into the Message object. It is handled by the provider impl and the wire protocol-- there is not support for the DeliveryDelay field in OpenWire at this time and there is nothing in ActiveMQ code base that calls setDeliveryDelay, and then throw an exception unexpectedly on a user.\r\n\r\nAs far as anyone providing a JMS 2.0 wrapper for ActiveMQ-- any code that is currently calling ActiveMQ using a JMS 2.0 MessageProducer to set a DeliveryDelay must have a custom wrapper impl for MessageProducer. Those scenarios are out-of-reach edge cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/888331948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/888350778","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/682#issuecomment-888350778","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/682","id":888350778,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM8408yg6","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-28T14:22:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T14:22:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Based on how slowly things can happen sometimes I would push back against saying anything like \"these methods won't be unimplemented for long\" as who knows if/when it will be finished.\r\n\r\n@cshannon that's fair.

Configuring DeliveryDelay at all is not required. App sends JMS 1.1 providers message object, through JMS 2.0 client (which tolerates 1.1 messages). After this change as-is, making the '1.1 provider' use the 2.0 API and throw UOE for impl, that will fail all the time during send.\r\n\r\nIts possible for a JMS 2.0 client to work upon and send 1.1 message objects, tolerating that the message.setDeliveryTime() method is defined but is not being implemented by the older object (as clearly it didnt exist before, and so couldnt be implemented, but backwards compatibility is the name of the game for JMS). The JMS reference impl definitely did this. \r\n\r\nIts possible for a JMS 2.0 client to tolerate being used only with the 1.1 API jar and for the message.setDeliveryTime() method to not actually be defined at all at runtime. I dont recall if the RI did this.\r\n\r\nQpid JMS for example does both of these things. It will let you send a 1.1 message through it, and it will operate using the 1.1 API jar. It simply made sense to support when transitioning specs, not dropping support for using it with existing 1.1 providers (e.g 5.x) or existing applications, when they couldn't actually be doing anything that wasnt still supported as all that API all remained precisely for compatibility. Those are very different situations from the method being defined, implemented and explicitly throwing UOE, and I dont expect anything to really handle that it really makes no sense for it to ever do so, especially for a long setter that is simply for recording 'what actually happened during send'.\r\n\r\nNote that all sends will fail, regardless whether a delivery delay is configured on the producer, as a value is always being set on the sent messages to either indicate the actual delivery time or ensure it records there was no delay (as the sent message object may previously have had a deliveryTime value, so that needs cleared to ensure the getter reflects reality).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I don't see how #4 happens with #3 is in place as you indicated.

A method not existing / not being implemented and that being handled, is quite different than it actually being there but deliberately throwing.\r\n\r\n> As as side-effect, by swallowing the 'set' and returning '0' on get, we'd be silently wiping out the DeliveryDelay and users would have no indication as to why DeliveryDelay is not occurring.

Ssend the JMS Message objects from 5.x through a foriegn JMS 2 provider impl. Any that implements what the JMS 2 spec says and as a result tries to apply the mandated value to the original message (using the vendor-neutral Message API in place specifically to let it do so) will fail.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> (admittedly as a passive watcher of this PR, I'm having a hard time following your suggestions, i.e. understanding how the implementation of delivery delay that _does not_ throw exceptions in the case of trying to mutate or access data that isn't supported could provide return values with meaning, \r\n\r\nBecause those Message methods are not really a core part of the implementation of Delivery Delay in 5.x itself, which is really part of the producer impl. They have nothing to do with the behaviour applied by 5.x during send, as was noted during this discussion. They are specifically there to ensure foreign providers can record the values _they_ are applying with _their_ support. Anything should be able to call the 5.x message setJMSDeliveryTime and getJMSDeliveryTime methods and expect it to work, regardless whether the 5.x producer actually supports configuring a delivery delay.\r\n\r\n> and the linked test case I'm assuming is failing due to this implementation decision: https://github.com/apache/qpid-jms/blob/6775a2e027d8963cda4f1a7dc75b115c5def4d47/qpid-jms-client/src/main/java/org/apache/qpid/jms/JmsSession.java#L999 - in which case QPID could choose to catch the UOE in a similar manner)\r\n\r\nNo, thats what will happens before this PR, when the client takes steps to let a JMS 1.1 message object be sent, because obviously it doesnt find the relevant method implemented, it didnt exist. This PR adds the JMS 2.0 method impl (which then throws), meaning the client actually finds it implemented and will proceed to the lower section and actually calling it. Expecting it to work and not throw UOE, because theres really no reason a simple set/get of a mandatory JMS header long value should ever throw. The Qpid JMS client will not be catching UOE's to satisfy such behaviour from ActiveMQ, that in itself would be incorrect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/892982659/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/892984820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/682#issuecomment-892984820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/682","id":892984820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM841Od30","user":{"login":"gemmellr","id":5106823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDY4MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5106823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr","html_url":"https://github.com/gemmellr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemmellr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-04T21:24:08Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T21:24:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> \r\n> It’s not about qpid its that you’re breaking cross protocol stuff.
