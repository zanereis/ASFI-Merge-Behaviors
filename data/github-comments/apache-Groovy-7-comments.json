I felt it made the code easier to understand.\n\nThe `lower1 != lower2` check protecting the `equalIncludingGenerics` call is indeed useless and can be removed to simplify.\n\nHowever, I can also definitely limit the change to removing the `lower1 == lower2` shortcut if you'd rather keep the change as small as possible. I think the code is more brittle (and a bit less readable) as it is -- you couldn't swap the lower and upper bounds checks as they are if you wanted to, for example, because of the `upper1 == upper2` shortcut which would become as incorrect as `lower1 == lower2` currently is -- but it certainly works.

IN your case that would be the information of what bridge methods do need to be added\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/188255630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/188258161","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/257#issuecomment-188258161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/257","id":188258161,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODI1ODE2MQ==","user":{"login":"blackdrag","id":470278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag","html_url":"https://github.com/blackdrag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blackdrag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-24T13:38:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T13:38:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/188258161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/188303338","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/265#issuecomment-188303338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/265","id":188303338,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODMwMzMzOA==","user":{"login":"shils","id":2948884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg4ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2948884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils","html_url":"https://github.com/shils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-24T15:20:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-24T15:20:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"To answer your last question: it looks like the problem is that your delegating method calls use a variable with the delegate name as the receiver, even when the delegate is a method.

I have been away for this weekend, and now I'm down with a cold, so I cannot think too straight.\nRegarding how to start a shell with modifications, my workflow has been very messy so far:\n1. I run gradle dist to create a distribution, and unzip it to some location (to have dependencies to put on the classpath).\n2. I delete groovy-groovysh-$VERSION.jar from that location\n3. Then I remove all groovy-based .class files left in the source dir that could be/become stale:\n   `rm -rf subprojects/groovy-groovysh/target/classes/.../shell/*.class` (But NOT java-based class files)\n4. Finally I run a script that starts the Main:\n\n```\nexport CLASSPATH=\\\nsubprojects/groovy-groovysh/target/classes/main:\\\nsubprojects/groovy-groovysh/target/resources/main:\\\ntarget/classes/main:\\\ntarget/resources/main:\\\n.../commons-cli-1.3.1.jar:\\\n.../asm-5.0.3.jar:\\\n.../jline-2.12.jar:\\\n.../antlr-2.7.7.jar:\\\n\njava -classpath $CLASSPATH  org.codehaus.groovy.tools.shell.Main $@\n```\n\nThis is the only way I found to be sure to run the groovy classes I am modifying against the latest java classes and latest groovysh groovy sources. Probably there is a better way, but once I got this to work, I did not bother to find that better way. Obviously it is too messy to document as recommendation.\n\nStarting in the IDE should also work, but I usually avoid it, as I am suspicious of differences between a real command line and the IDEs command-lines.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/192945171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/192957480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/283#issuecomment-192957480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/283","id":192957480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Mjk1NzQ4MA==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-06T18:34:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T18:34:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

So overall I'd be -1 for this particular commit.\n\nThe other commits look good to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/193491350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/193637256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/282#issuecomment-193637256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/282","id":193637256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzYzNzI1Ng==","user":{"login":"oreissig","id":4244988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDQ5ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4244988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig","html_url":"https://github.com/oreissig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T07:11:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T07:11:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I also thought about the widening of scope, that may be unintended, but if there's a synthetic accessor method generated, it actually is made available inside the package anyway?

From a coding perspective it is not really feasible for another class in the package to use these compiler generated accessors (i.e., they wont show up in IDE code completion).  By widening the scope of the members of the enclosing class encapsulation is being broken in order to avoid having a few synthetic accessors; the only benefit might be slight performance increase and that is even very questionable.  But many people work on the codebase and encapsulation is more important in my opinion in this context.  If someone working in the code see they can access the member they may think it was designed to be accessed by classes in the package when it actually was not.\n\n> Scope-wise there's not much of a difference between a package-private field and a package-private getter, or is there one?\n\nNo I don't believe so.  In my original comment I was referring to synthetic accessors in general and not just those generated for methods.  I think again it comes back to encapsulation and breaking it just to avoid the synthetic accessors is not a good thing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/193866145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/193879725","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/285#issuecomment-193879725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/285","id":193879725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Mzg3OTcyNQ==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-08T17:29:36Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T17:29:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Closing to clean up import.
