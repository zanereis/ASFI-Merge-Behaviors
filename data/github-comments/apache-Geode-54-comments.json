I cannot help but feel that the whole logic of (un)/locking of the `connectionLifeCycleLock` should really be a little more hidden.

Which makes it way too easy to actually miss logic where the connection lock needs to be used.\r\n@boglesby @gesterzhou maybe we should be locking at moving all this logic to another location. \r\nThere is also no indication of WHY this lock is required? Is it protecting the accessing of `connection` properties or is it avoiding the accidental setting of the `connection` field with another instance? It is not clear.

Thinking about it, the whole \"testHook\" logic should live in a test class that extends the `ClusterDistributionManager`. In this test, there would be no problem doing this. Whilst it would require some refactoring of the root class to allow for the extension, I don't think it would be that significant that this cannot be achieved.\r\n\r\nAlso, given the fact that there is only one location where a `ClusterDistributionManager` is created, I imagine it would be only a small refactor to have an ability to pass in a DistributionManager into the `InternalDistributedSystem` in order to have the ability to switch to another DistributionManager. It might actually even simplify some of the logic in the `InternalDistributedSystem`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/727675133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/728161074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5748#issuecomment-728161074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5748","id":728161074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODE2MTA3NA==","user":{"login":"jhutchison","id":1131716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE3MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1131716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison","html_url":"https://github.com/jhutchison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhutchison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T16:10:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T16:10:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Seems good!

I think totalCount == 0 means that the oplog is empty. This seems like something we should compact. Do you understand why offline compaction gave us an empty oplog? I'm concerned this change might cause us not to remove empty oplogs. Or maybe we say it has no need to compact but still do a check and remove it for being empty somewhere else?\r\n\r\nI have added a unit test in `OplogTest`. \r\n\r\n`totalCount` == 0 does not necessarily mean the oplog is empty. You remind me of the case of an empty oplog. There is another field `totalLiveCount` to check. What I see in the persistent recovery immediately after an offline compaction is, the offline compacted oplog is non-empty. During the recovery, `totalCount` is `0`. However, `totalLiveCount` has the actual number of live entries in the oplog. Therefore I add one more condition to check `totalLiveCount`. \r\n\r\nIf `totalCount` == 0 and `totalLiveCount` > 0, such as the case of recovery after offline compaction, we don't need compaction again. Are there any other cases that need compaction, even though `totalCount` == 0 and `totalLiveCount` > 0?\r\n\r\nIf `totalCount` == 0 and `totalLiveCount` <= 0, then the oplog is empty, which needs compaction.

It was even signed off by arguably one of the SMEs in this code area.\r\n\r\nIf there is some private, non-Geode, related failure, then is this really a concern to Geode? ServerLocation is in the \"internal\" package space. Which means that any Geode committers/developers have fullest right and privilege to alter and modify its behavior without concern of breaking backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n@gesterzhou It seems there is a growing concern that this change has broken a rolling upgrade and backward compatibility. I think there is a much larger concern now. How did an internal class leak out of its \"internal\" containment? How did we not catch THAT? WHY would an internal class now break rolling upgrades? \r\n\r\nI fully support the reverting of this PR if we can prove that rolling upgrades will suffer from this change AND then raise a corresponding ticket to fix the underlying root cause, which it seems is the leaking of internal classes.\r\n\r\nI disagree with the proposed fix of \"adding of the memberId String to the ServerLocation\". Whilst it may \"fix\" the problem, it merely glosses over the fact that we seem to have a potentially larger problem here.\r\n\r\n@bschuchardt would you mind looking at this problem? As it seems that there is a larger problem here that would possibly not have been considered when we initially approved the [PR](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5670).
