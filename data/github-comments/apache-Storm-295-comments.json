One for how long it took to schedule all of the topologies in the loop.  This indicates how responsive we are likely to be when a worker crashes and it needs to be rescheduled or when a topology is launched and it needs to be scheduled the first time.\r\n\r\nThe second one I would be interested in is a histogram for how long it took to schedule each individual topology.  Sadly that one is much harder, because it would have to be something each scheduler reported on their own.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/331484748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/331485401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2338#issuecomment-331485401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2338","id":331485401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQ4NTQwMQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T15:49:20Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T15:49:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@govind-menon

I think we want to combine STORM-2753 with this into a single pull request.\r\n\r\n@HeartSaVioR \r\n\r\nI think I need to give a little background on this so it makes since, and I am not sure this is the best solution which is why I would like to see the two combined into a single pull request.\r\n\r\nWe ran into some issues where pacemaker servers were being killed because of a client being shot at the wrong time, or security scans, etc.  The issue was that the uncaught exception handler was not what we wanted for the pacemaker server.  We then adjusted some things and ended up with an end user that had their topology crashing periodically because an exception that was being thrown on a background thread, and ignored previously, was now fatal.\r\n\r\nSo the goal with these was to find a balance.  We want the default uncaught exception handler for all threads to be a little bit more lenient.  But for daemon threads we already handle exceptions very strictly so the default UncaughtExceptionHandler is not needed here.\r\n\r\nBut thinking about it now perhaps what we want is something that is a bit more explicit about what is happening.  For example we can perhaps have a separate default exception handler for the worker from everything else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/331490009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/331509151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2331#issuecomment-331509151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2331","id":331509151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTUwOTE1MQ==","user":{"login":"Ethanlm","id":14900612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14900612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethanlm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T17:24:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T17:24:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A test:\r\nI monitored the metrics through JMX.

I could go even further and parse out the topology name too.\r\n\r\nNow I am kind of in trouble, because I have two different fields that can be anything on both ends of the name.  So my best bet is to look for something that looks like `\\.(\\d+)-` and hope that neither the component name nor the metric name happens to have used something that matches that pattern.\r\n\r\nMy concern here is that most of what we are truly encoding in the name is metadata.  All of the examples that graphite and ganglia show use the name as a hierarchy to make finding the metric I want simpler, i.e. 'system.memory.memory_allocated', or perhaps subdividing the metrics by application, 'app1.memory.memory_allocated'.  Metadata like the host name, port, component, etc, are really supported through tags.  The collectors are not attempting to pull out the metadata and then turn it back into tags.  So for example lets start with a simple use case. I want to know how many tuples component B has emitted.  Currently that would require me to combine N separate metrics together, one per port.\r\n\r\nstorm.topology.MYTOPO-1-1000.B.6700-emitted\r\nstorm.topology.MYTOPO-1-1000.B.6701-emitted\r\n...\r\nstorm.topology.MYTOPO-1-1000.B.N-emitted\r\n\r\nand then rewrite if I launch my topology again I now have to rewrite all of my queries to match.  I personally think everyone would be a lot happier if we could find a good way to translate these into tags.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the built in metrics that mostly @abellina, and me a tiny bit, have been working on wants these to be metadata.  Simply because we cannot reproduce what is happening on the UI in any other clean way.  I am fine with us using the metric name to store some of this metadata (sadly drop-wizard gives us no other option), but we really need to parse it out before sending it on.  I am not sure how simple that would be, seeing how they already come with built in reporters which was a lot of what we wanted them for.  If it is not going to be simple to do, then perhaps dropwizard was the wrong choice for a metrics library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/333228462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
