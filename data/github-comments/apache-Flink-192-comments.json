My suggestion is to not do these optimizations yet.\r\n\r\nAt first, because this seems like a pre-mature optimization to me as we are not sure yet about the interplay between all the features we are planning to put in `CEP`, and we know that if we allow users to add `Patterns` at runtime, then we will need 1) to store both States and Conditions and 2) match the States and Conditions of a given NFA with its SharredBuffer. In other words, we will need a unique Id for each NFA, that will match the restored sharedBuffer (which is still serialized and deserialized as before) with the States (`metastates` in this PR) and Conditions (`ConditionRegistry` in https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4145) of the NFA. \r\n\r\nSo I propose to implement this https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-7008 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6938 right away so that we can proceed with the SQL integration, and think a more general solution for checkpointing separately the static state of the NFA (state and conditions) from the dynamic one (sharedbuffer), which will lead to runtime gains.\r\n\r\nThis `Pattern-Id` can be a user specified name that has to be unique across all Patterns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311310118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311313445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4187#issuecomment-311313445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4187","id":311313445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTMxMzQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T10:05:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T10:05:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please resolve the checkstyle violations:\r\n```\r\n\r\n[ERROR] src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/internal/KafkaConsumerThread.java:[96] (javadoc) JavadocStyle: First sentence should end with a period.\r\n[ERROR] src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/internal/KafkaConsumerThread.java:[99] (javadoc) JavadocStyle: First sentence should end with a period.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311313445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311316572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4187#issuecomment-311316572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4187","id":311316572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTMxNjU3Mg==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T10:19:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T10:27:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @zhenzhongxu, thanks for the PR. I like the idea of exposing these metrics.\r\n\r\n**Regarding the metric naming:**\r\nI think we also expose metrics that are directly available through the Kafka client.\r\nApart from this PR, there was also previous discussion about adding other Flink-specific metrics to the connector (e.g., offset lag since last checkpoint).\r\nI wonder whether or not we should regulate the naming scheme for these Flink-specific metrics, to set them apart from Kafka's provided metrics.\r\n\r\n**Regarding the implementation:**\r\nThis current solution only exposes the metric for Kafka 09 and 010.\r\nIdeally, this should be added to the `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase`, so that we don't end up doing the same thing in future versions. It would be a bit more work, such as providing a callback to `AbstractFetcher.commitInternalOffsetsToKafka`, but then it would be properly implemented.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311316572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311318025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3895#issuecomment-311318025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3895","id":311318025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTMxODAyNQ==","user":{"login":"packbase","id":1178321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1178321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase","html_url":"https://github.com/packbase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/packbase/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T10:25:46Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T10:25:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The design has changed, and close it first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311318025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311323683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3416#issuecomment-311323683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3416","id":311323683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTMyMzY4Mw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T10:53:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T10:53:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"merging, sorry it took so long!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311323683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311324656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4172#issuecomment-311324656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4172","id":311324656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTMyNDY1Ng==","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T10:57:52Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T10:57:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kl0u Thanks for the comments.

Thanks!\r\n\r\n1. For the param rename I am not sure whether it can be shared with `early fire` feature  or not. I suggest using current name, and we can change it if we need when we dev the `early fire` feature. And feel free to rename it in this PR. if you and @wuchong Insist on to renaming, I am fine about that. :)\r\n\r\n2. About timestamp and watermark:\r\n- Timestamp: \r\nI think we can emit records with the correct timestamps(late than watermark,but corresponds to window time ), I thinks the code `timestampedCollector.setAbsoluteTimestamp(window.maxTimestamp())` of  `WindowOperator#emitWindowContents` can guarantee that logic. That's meant it late than watermark,but is correct.\r\n\r\n- Watermark:\r\n  In current flink framework，GroupWindow and OverWindow related the `Watermark`. So If i understand you correctly, you worry about GroupWindow followed by a GroupWindow or  a OverWindow. Let's see follows:\r\n     - For followed by GroupWindow case:\r\n      As we know  `deferredComputationTime` is global configuration, i.e. In one job all GroupWindow will using the same TRIGGER(`DeferredComputationTrigger`), that only fires when current watermark not smaller than ` (window.maxTimestamp + queryConfig.getDeferredComputationTime)`. The records will be late emitted by the Level N window, So dose the Level N+1 window. The late always is `getDeferredComputationTime` time. i.e., This approach adds latency but can reduce the number of update esp.(that we wanted)\r\n\r\n     - For followed by OverWindow case: **Need improve code.**\r\n\r\n     - For select, filter...etc. I think also work well (adds latency).\r\n\r\n3.  About `Trigger+ AssignerWithPunctuatedWatermarks` (@wuchong comment above), Trigger is late `deferredComputationTime` and Watermark change it smaller (`deferredComputationTime`), If we have `window1(..).winodw2(...).window3()`. the delay is increasing.\r\n\r\n**So, the current approach can improved Level 1 group window, and end-to-end latency is `deferredComputationTime`.**\r\n\r\n**If we want let all the window only fired late `deferredComputationTime`, we should think about SLA mechanism. (Which we had discussed before).**\r\n\r\nThe above description just from point of my view. So feel free to correct me if there are any incorrect analysis.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think? \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSunJincheng\r\n\r\n  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311603919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311605438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4183#issuecomment-311605438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4183","id":311605438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTYwNTQzOA==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T09:22:26Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T09:22:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, @fhueske I write comments for a long time, so i have not seen your reply util i send out my reply.\r\n\r\nI think we do not need the current trigger if we custom operators, we only change watermark is enough.\r\nIs that your meaning.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSunJincheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311605438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311621553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4183#issuecomment-311621553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4183","id":311621553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTYyMTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T10:31:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T10:33:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @fhueske , jincheng and me have discussed offline and have an unified opinion.\r\n\r\nWe think the approach of window(with custom trigger) + custom operator will increase the latency when multiple window aggregate is applied.

However, the second window will still defer 1 hour to compute which result in the final result is delayed for two hours. \r\n\r\nWe think we only need to hold the watermark back at source, then all the downstream window operators will defer the given offset to compute.

@sunjincheng121, that's very good input for the discussion!\r\n\r\n1. I would like to avoid to unnecessarily change the API and to deprecate methods and parameters. IMO, `firstResultTimeOffset` is a better name because it describes that there is an offset in time to compute the first result. Also, configuring early firing and deferred computation would be possible (from an API point of view) if we have a dedicated parameter for each feature. So we would need to check if both parameters are set and throw an exception. If we only have a single parameter `firstResultTimeOffset` there can be no invalid configuration because you either compute an early or deferred result.\r\n\r\n2.1. Yes, it is possible to emit records with correct (i.e., window end) timestamps and this is what we should do.\r\n\r\n2.2. I think we cannot rely on the fact that other operators support deferred computation. First, this would force us to implement this for all time-based operators (like over windows and later joins). Second, if we convert a table with a deferred group window aggregation back into a DataStream, all records of the stream would be late. I just had a discussion with @aljoscha about this issue. Holding back watermarks is not really possible in Flink and adjusting watermarks after a window operator incrementally adds latency. \r\n\r\n@sunjincheng121 I think you are right about the adjustment of the watermarks. The only approach that doesn't add more latency than the offset is to subtract the offset from the watermarks at all sources. We would not need to add any custom triggers and all operators (including future ones) would immediately support deferred computation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @sunjincheng121 and @wuchong?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311682741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311684877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4183#issuecomment-311684877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4183","id":311684877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTY4NDg3Nw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-28T14:54:25Z","updated_at":"2017-06-28T14:54:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry @wuchong, I started my comment in the morning and got stuck in meetings.

(that's SLA mechanism).  we are on the same boat. \r\n\r\nI think the value of `firstResultTimeOffset` is represent the maximum delay of the data source. e.g., the TT source guarantee that the maximum delay of data is no more than 5 seconds. Then we can set `firstResultTimeOffset=5 seconds`. \r\n\r\nSo, the name of `firstResultTimeOffset` not pretty suitable. and i think this config item can not be used in `early` feature. for example the maximum data delay of TT source is 5seconds, so we should set `firstResultTimeOffset=5`, but we also want get `early` result  for a window (of course we must deal with retract/updated result). \r\n\r\nAt current time I also suggest separate the  `deferred` and `early` configuration items. `deferred` is a configuration item of data source data delay SLA. and `early` is a configuration item of emit window result. How about `slaOfdataDelay`? I am not good at naming the config item. But want try to  clearly express the meaning of this configuration item. \r\n\r\nTo be honest I'm not sure about `early result` feature whether we are on the same boat or not.

(that's SLA mechanism). we are on the same boat.\r\n\r\nI think the value of `firstResultTimeOffset` is represent the maximum delay of the data source. e.g., the TT source guarantee that the maximum delay of data is no more than 5 seconds. Then we can set `firstResultTimeOffset=5 seconds`.\r\n\r\nSo, the name of `firstResultTimeOffset` not pretty suitable. and i think this config item can not be used in early feature. for example the maximum data delay of TT source is 5seconds, so we should set `firstResultTimeOffset=5`, but we also want get early result for a window (of course we must deal with retract/updated result).\r\n\r\nAt current time I also suggest separate the deferred and early configuration items. `deferred` is a configuration item of data source data delay SLA. and `early` is a configuration item of emit window result. How about `slaOfdataDelay`? I am not good at naming the config item. But want try to clearly express the meaning of this configuration item.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I'm not sure about early result feature whether we are on the same boat or not. If not, I think we need detail communication.

to early firing, I think we are not on the same page and need to discuss about what is early firing, how to configure it, how to implement it. \r\n\r\nIMO, the early firing is to config an update rate of window. Such as an one-hour window, but we want to see the result every minutes. So it is very similar to [FLINK-6649](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6649)(update rate for non-windowed group), but this is a \r\nupdate-rate/early-interval configuration on window group.

I am not an expert in Janino and how it works but I do not think you need Janino's classloader at any point. Using the `open()` of the `CEPOperator` you just need to compile the code of the `IterativeCondition` whenever we have a `IterativeConditionWrapper`. In the code snippet you sent before, line 30 and later whenever you use the `janinoCL` should change to take the user classloader from the runtime context. If I remember correctly it is `getRuntimeContext().getUserClassLoader()`. \r\n\r\nThis will allow Janino to do its magic using the user classloader. After compiling the class, you can set the `newCondition` field of the `StateTransitions` to an object of the compiled class. \r\n\r\nAfter this, whenever you have a checkpoint or whenever you serialize/deserialize the condition, given that this will be a regular IterativeCondition, Flink will know how to do it.\r\n\r\nI am also including @twalthr and @fhueske on this to comment, as they have more experience with this. In addition, if you have a prototype that does all this but fails at some step with an error, you can send a link and we can try to check it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311906695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311910436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4187#issuecomment-311910436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4187","id":311910436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTkxMDQzNg==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T09:17:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T09:17:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please follow the camel-case pattern that we use for other metrics.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311910436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/311919756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3746#issuecomment-311919756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3746","id":311919756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTkxOTc1Ng==","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T09:55:50Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T09:55:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @aljoscha, I've rebased this PR, fixed the previous blocking issue (discovery enabling & restoring from round-robin list state), and added documentation for the limitation.
