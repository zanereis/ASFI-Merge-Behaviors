Steph,\r\n\r\nYou actually add a header in normal usage by calling record.headers.add(key,value), this constructor was added in the record really only aimed at mirror making solutions.\r\n\r\nAlso adding headers is mostly aimed to be added by interceptors (where record is given) thus mutable at that stage. This is why on produce once sent the headers are made read only.\r\n\r\nYes connect framework isn't done as wasn't covered in this KIP, once this KIP was done I was actially going to raise another KIP immediately to add them (a bit like timestamp was first added to core and then a second kip was raised to add them to connect), but first step it was important to get headers added at the core level.
