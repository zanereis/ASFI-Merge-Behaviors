The `.new` is used to act as a two-phase commit approach, so in case during provisioning (for example, a live system using provisionCertificate API) if anything goes bad, it won't affect an existing keystore. Lastly, in addition to the keystore file, the certificates and keys are also stored in usual x509/pem formats with `chmod 600` applied to them, at the agent conf directory for usage with other services.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/324971414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/324978379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2239#issuecomment-324978379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2239","id":324978379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDk3ODM3OQ==","user":{"login":"mlsorensen","id":1047709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/mlsorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-25T16:59:02Z","updated_at":"2017-08-25T16:59:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks.

XenServer env related failure was caused by centos7 based packging/dependencies issues where pyopessl.crypto may not have a `load_publickey` method available. I've put a fix in the marvin test to skip when pyopenssl library does not export such a method, with that all tests pass now:\r\n\r\n=== TestName: test_issue_certificate_with_csr | Status : SUCCESS ===\r\n\r\n=== TestName: test_issue_certificate_without_csr | Status : SUCCESS ===\r\n\r\n=== TestName: test_list_ca_certificate | Status : SUCCESS ===\r\n\r\n=== TestName: test_list_ca_providers | Status : SUCCESS ===\r\n\r\n=== TestName: test_provision_certificate | Status : SUCCESS ===\r\n\r\n=== TestName: test_revoke_certificate | Status : SUCCESS ===\r\n\r\nWith enough test results and code reviews, this is ready for merging. I'll wait for Travis to go green and then merge this feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/325306453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/325309337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2044#issuecomment-325309337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2044","id":325309337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTMwOTMzNw==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T09:42:23Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T09:42:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blueorangutan package","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/325309337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/325309509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2044#issuecomment-325309509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2044","id":325309509,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTMwOTUwOQ==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T09:43:07Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T09:43:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DaanHoogland a Jenkins job has been kicked to build packages.
