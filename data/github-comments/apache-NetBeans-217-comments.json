(Keeping the pre-existing code computing the workspace folders, as that is needed as a default working directory.)\r\n> > Having one workspace should be the typical thing.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, having one workspace is the typical use-case.\r\n\r\nNote that the current default is that for every workspace/VS Code UI window, there is a separate backend started. I.e. this is not about the number of windows open, but rather whether the backend is shared by multiple windows, which is not the default.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > What do you think?\r\n> \r\n> When I was adding this new code, my concern with this approach of defaulting to the single open workspace was that it may lead to a security/_cross-talk_ issue if someone opens a file external to the regular workspace (with workspace folders).\r\n> \r\n>     * The workspace arguments and VM options might contain credentials etc. which should not be sent to the workspace-external program, _even when its a trusted file_.\r\n\r\nIsn't that a problem with this patch as well? If the backend is shared among multiple windows, and I have multiple windows with workspaces without folders, this patch will pick one of the UI windows/settings/clients semi-\"randomly\", no?\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Additionally, opening the same file when another workspace is open would lead to different runtime behaviour.\r\n>       \r\n>       * This would also be outside the user's control.\r\n\r\nI suspect the same will be with this patch - if the backend is shared among windows, then one of then will be selected, no? And if the backend is not shared, then there's only one workspace, and all should work consistently?\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * On the other hand, by using only the _global_ workspace, i.e. without any workspace folders, the user would have greater control.\r\n>       \r\n>       * It would be clear that only the global run configuration is in effect.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Do you think that in case no suitable workspace is found, then this method should introduce adding a new `Workspace`?\r\n> \r\n>     * I think this might be harder to achieve since it would require changing `WorkspaceServiceImpl` and maybe `WorkspaceService` and the scope of that seems very wide.\r\n\r\nThe Workspace is basically just a part of the mirror that mirrors the UI Window. I don't think we can meaningfully create a new one.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Please let me know what you think.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2263611724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2263631089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7626#issuecomment-2263631089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7626","id":2263631089,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6G7ETx","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-01T17:51:06Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T17:51:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This sounds as if you installed NB22 into the same directory that NB18 was installed into.

Not quite sure if this is user-friendly.\r\n\r\nAlso note that with the current patch, (I believe) I can have a file open in window 1 and ran from there, but settings may be taken from window 2, just because window 2's workspace has no folders.

I would suggest to cleanup the patch, removing as many of drive-by changes (changes that are not necessary for the functionality of the patch).\r\n\r\nhi @lahodaj , @mbien  thanks for taking a look into pr ,  i have added minor refactoring changes to improve readability of code in the same method where fix related changes exist(while i was debugging the issue), just following this [clean code principle](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596809515/ch08.html). as @mbien  mentioned i have added refactoring changes in one commit(where tests are passing before adding fix) and fix as head commit(with new tests). i would like to summarise refactoring changes as below. take a look and let me know which and all refactoring changes you see doesn't add value, will revert them accordingly.\r\n\r\n1. introduced  variables like `ACTION_TYPE_ADD_BLANK_LINE ` and  `STATE_INITIAL_TEXT` as constants to remove code smell - *magic numbers* (as you are ok with this and @mbien was suggesting to add enums, will enumize these)\r\n2. variable like `currNWSPos`, `lastNWSPos` , `currWSPos`, `lastWSPos`,  NWS and WS here was bit cryptic i have renamed these variables accordingly to improve readability(will revert these changes as you suggested these doesn't seem to be adding value)\r\n3. renamed variable names from `toAdd ` to `marker` , `marker` noun suited better as we are adding marked position and action  to `LinkedList<Pair<Integer, Integer>> marks = new LinkedList<Pair<Integer, Integer>>()` , renamed  variable`checkOffset` verb to `markedOffset` noun as we are  retrieving markedOffset from  `marks`  list\r\n4. marked few variables like `offset` as final , as current method is ~700 lines long and multiple variables and states  are mutating, just marked some variables like these to `final` which are used as readonly values with the intent to improve readability.\r\n\r\nlet me know @lahodaj if you don't see value add on point's 3,4 will go ahead and revert them.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2274810806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2274858894","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/3962#issuecomment-2274858894","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3962","id":2274858894,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6Hl5eO","user":{"login":"epliskin","id":27805221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODA1MjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27805221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin","html_url":"https://github.com/epliskin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epliskin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-08T02:58:03Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T02:58:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I suggest from my experience that the magic \"reset\" action is due to the \"cut\" function as opposed to the \"copy\" function.

The problem as I see it is, that #7579 removed the default registration of `JavaErrorProvider` in NetBeans IDE and registers it only in NetBeans VSCode. But that fix is incomplete, as the NB Codebase holds other `ErrorProvider` implementations, that need to be removed also.\r\n> ...\r\n> Some of these are covered, but they need to be checked.\r\n> \r\n> For PHP the errors flow through the `GsfErrorProvider`.\r\n\r\nYes, the flow goes thru `GsfErrorProvider`. The `PHPLanguage` uses `@LanguageRegistration(mimeType=PHP_MIME_TYPE...)` registration which registers `ErrorProvider` as well as a Gsf own implementation that fills the `HintsCollector.setErrors`.\r\n\r\nI somehow need to find out in the `ErrorProviderBridge` that the delegation shouldn't happen. If we want to do it in really compatible way, then:\r\n- we need to differentiate between the providers written prior to #7579\r\n- and providers that want to benefit from #7579 support\r\n\r\n> @jtulach can you provide a fix?\r\n\r\n#7659 is my attempt to make the #7579 support change as compatible as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2282667405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
