I don't think short-polling is a good option architecturally. Short-polling necessarily introduces latency as the system waits between polling intervals. The lower the latency desired in the system, the greater the load placed on the server to answer short-poll requests. Maintaining an open websocket connection solves this problem.\r\n\r\nTo respond to your question on tabs, yes, I think \"many tabs\" is a problem. Our user research indicates that a small number of power-users create the majority of content inside of organizations. These users tend to have job titles like \"business analyst\", and for them a large number of open tabs is the norm. For this reason I would say we want non-active tabs to be actively updated. Think of a situation where you fire a query against a data warehouse in one tab, then switch away to work on something else. Ideally, there would be some manner of notification on update to let the user know that the query has finished. This is possible with active websockets without increasing server overhead. With short-polling, we can DDOS ourselves from inactive tabs but if we disable short-polling on inactive tabs we're going to negatively impact the user experience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/594097266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/594099395","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8921#issuecomment-594099395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8921","id":594099395,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDA5OTM5NQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T18:30:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T18:30:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Fill in Time Column with the column contain the timestamps at which events happen, this will be used to order the events by elapsed time (you can order by event sequence too by opening the \"Controls\" in the right pane).\r\n2. Set the Time Grain to at least as small as your Time Column granularity for the most accurate viz. Coarser time grains will get DATE_TRUNC and lose/become wrong information. You can click View query and View results within top right hamburger icon to verify what your settings will run and result in.\r\n\r\n**Event Definition**\r\n1. Column containing entity ids\r\nSelect the categorical values to show on the y-axis \r\n2. Column containing event names\r\nSelect the categorical values to show on the x-axis\r\n3. Event count limit \r\nCut off point for number of vertical lines on the viz \r\n4. Minimum leaf node event count\r\nNot sure, no effect on my graph\r\n\r\n**Controls**\r\nThere are many controls here all interacting with one another. \r\n1. Drop down list containing DISTINCT of what you put in  \"Column containing event names\"\r\n2. `+ -` button to move the reference point around\r\n3. Pie Chart (not for controlling) to see the results of your controls\r\n4. List of checkboxes containing items from 1. to turn on and off in the main viz and pie chart\r\n5. Hide nodes with too little samples of a certain type of flow (gradually increase it's value from 1 to filter/clean up the viz)\r\n6. Elapsed-Time vs Event Sequence (select the latter first before playing with controls 1,2 to help understanding the reference point shifting mechanism)\r\n\r\n**Usage tips**\r\n1. When moving reference point, observe where the dotted vertical line is.\r\n2. When you move reference to the right, some flows have negative time, these negative nodes can get vertically misaligned with their positive nodes (think of the negative side as an independent y-axis)\r\n3. When 2 events happen at exactly the same time, zoom in multiple times to see the thin vertical bar in viz so you can mouseover/click\r\n4. Click into any event in viz to see which  \"Column containing entity ids\" they represent.(only after clicking the event open does the dragging of bottom pane up work)\r\n\r\n**Problems**\r\n1. When 2 events begin/occur at exactly the same time, the viz seems to show the event coming first in row order in the \"View results\". Turning on and off event filters in the Controls helps reveal the overlayed hidden events.\r\n2. Wrong information in event bars, eg. 1st to 2nd event ~9days, 2nd to 3rd event 5minutes (notice the scale change). The 1st to 2nd event shows 8.9d 2nd to 3rd event shows 0.0d mean elapsed time.(looks like round down issue)\r\n3. y-axis label of \"# events\" looks like it should mean \"DISTINCT(Column containing entity ids)\"\r\n\r\n**Debugging Tips**\r\n1. Tweak Column containing entity ids and Column containing event names to use categoricals of finer granularity (if you have/suspect you have hierarchical categoricals where 1 col represents similar information as another. eg. music--> TV, music--> Radio). Take this to the extreme by using completely unique ids in Column containing event names to trace through how exactly the event flowed through\r\n2. Look at the # Events above the pie chart under Controls. This is less confusing than then the # events from hovering over the viz\r\n\r\n1st week using superset for me, looks like a great tool. Anyone knows where/how can we set up a proper documentation for each time of available visualisation? I would love to learn interesting uses of other types of viz too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/595766054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/595817414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8818#issuecomment-595817414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8818","id":595817414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTgxNzQxNA==","user":{"login":"righttracknana","id":56507784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA3Nzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56507784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana","html_url":"https://github.com/righttracknana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/righttracknana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T15:24:05Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T15:24:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi all,\r\nNew to superset and your comments above have been really helpful.\r\n\r\nI just downloaded superset yesterday and I am able to login without any errors but I am unable to view any charts or dashboards.

If superset didn't specialize in time-series data, I could maybe see that it might not need to fill in missing time periods with 0 values.  This would just be plotting the data as-is with time being like any other category.\r\n\r\nHowever, superset does specialize in time-series data.  And so it should handle the effective plotting of missing data for time frames.  In time series analysis you need to represent all time intervals that you are plotting across.  This is industry standard for time focused plots and it's what data viz viewers are expecting.
