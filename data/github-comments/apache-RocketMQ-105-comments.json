maxBlank来确定；二次发送链路（从定时或者事务里出来的），增加一个特殊的参数，以确保要发送成功；\r\n\r\n从该同学的报错日志来看，延迟消息投递失败，的确是长度超长引起的。\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31175234/167287070-df30c5a0-d70d-464a-a3fd-571b37a62dcc.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1120369770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1120376710","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4260#issuecomment-1120376710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4260","id":1120376710,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Cx5eG","user":{"login":"li-xiao-shuang","id":34903552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTAzNTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34903552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang","html_url":"https://github.com/li-xiao-shuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/li-xiao-shuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T08:47:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T08:47:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1120376710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1120377990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4260#issuecomment-1120377990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4260","id":1120377990,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Cx5yG","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T08:56:46Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T08:58:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
