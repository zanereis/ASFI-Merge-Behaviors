We are facing the same problem. When running Superset in a container with a local SQLite DB it's blazing fast. When swapping out the SQLite DB for a MySql DB running on AWS, it's extremely slow. It takes 10+ minutes to run the update/migrate process. Once that's finally done, the front end is extremely slow. Takes around 10 seconds to log in, from a container with no load and a database with only my container connected to it.\r\n\r\nIt's not a networking issue, since I download files from Amazon S3 as part of my init script and that runs at normal speed, in other words, fast. Just to be sure though, I started a container and ssh'ed into it, installed mysql-server, and connected to the remote database on AWS from the command line. That works perfectly fine and as speedy as you'd expect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/382935712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/382942064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4846#issuecomment-382942064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4846","id":382942064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mjk0MjA2NA==","user":{"login":"matiji66","id":13298806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjk4ODA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13298806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66","html_url":"https://github.com/matiji66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matiji66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-20T02:01:06Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T04:29:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What is a right configuration?
