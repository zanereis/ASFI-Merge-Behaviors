I have done this in the past and it was not a fun exercise to communicate and revert ;)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514049602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514051154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5454#issuecomment-514051154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5454","id":514051154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDA1MTE1NA==","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T04:39:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T04:39:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@potiuk Sorry it's my bad, I find out incorrect indent in https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/52b67c33340edd11331eda8cb79e4101709ec247#diff-c6f0a0722c6a2f86277535d7bcec7f8cR220 , I should check the content before commit","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514051154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514052048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5621#issuecomment-514052048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5621","id":514052048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDA1MjA0OA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T04:45:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T04:45:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @dimberman   -

The new exception should be handled by the CLI and set the appropriate exit code. \r\n\r\nFor example:: \r\nWhen we import variables and the path arguments is missing, then, we should report code 64\r\nWhen we import variables and the file does not exist, then, we should report code 72\r\nWhen we import variables and the file is invalid, then, we should report code 65\r\nWhen we import variable and unhandled exception occurred, we should report code 1\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about it?\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n````\r\nSYSEXITS(3)              BSD Library Functions Manual              SYSEXITS(3)\r\n\r\nNAME\r\n     sysexits -- preferable exit codes for programs\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n     #include <sysexits.h>\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n     According to style(9), it is not a good practice to call exit(3) with arbitrary values to indicate a failure condition when ending a program.  Instead, the pre-defined exit codes\r\n     from sysexits should be used, so the caller of the process can get a rough estimation about the failure class without looking up the source code.\r\n\r\n     The successful exit is always indicated by a status of 0, or EX_OK.  Error numbers begin at EX__BASE to reduce the possibility of clashing with other exit statuses that random\r\n     programs may already return.  The meaning of the codes is approximately as follows:\r\n\r\n     EX_USAGE (64)         The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.\r\n\r\n     EX_DATAERR (65)       The input data was incorrect in some way.  This should only be used for user's data and not system files.\r\n\r\n     EX_NOINPUT (66)       An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not readable.  This could also include errors like ``No message'' to a mailer (if it cared to catch\r\n                           it).\r\n\r\n     EX_NOUSER (67)        The user specified did not exist.  This might be used for mail addresses or remote logins.\r\n\r\n     EX_NOHOST (68)        The host specified did not exist.  This is used in mail addresses or network requests.\r\n\r\n     EX_UNAVAILABLE (69)   A service is unavailable.  This can occur if a support program or file does not exist.  This can also be used as a catchall message when something you\r\n                           wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.\r\n\r\n     EX_SOFTWARE (70)      An internal software error has been detected.  This should be limited to non-operating system related errors as possible.\r\n\r\n     EX_OSERR (71)         An operating system error has been detected.  This is intended to be used for such things as ``cannot fork'', ``cannot create pipe'', or the like.  It\r\n                           includes things like getuid returning a user that does not exist in the passwd file.\r\n\r\n     EX_OSFILE (72)        Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /var/run/utmp, etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some sort of error (e.g., syntax error).\r\n\r\n     EX_CANTCREAT (73)     A (user specified) output file cannot be created.\r\n\r\n     EX_IOERR (74)         An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.\r\n\r\n     EX_TEMPFAIL (75)      Temporary failure, indicating something that is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection, and the\r\n                           request should be reattempted later.\r\n\r\n     EX_PROTOCOL (76)      The remote system returned something that was ``not possible'' during a protocol exchange.\r\n\r\n     EX_NOPERM (77)        You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation.  This is not intended for file system problems, which should use EX_NOINPUT or\r\n                           EX_CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.\r\n\r\n     EX_CONFIG (78)        Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.\r\n\r\n     The numerical values corresponding to the symbolical ones are given in parenthesis for easy reference.\r\n\r\nSEE ALSO\r\n

I will definitely squeeze as much time as possible to help push this through( day time work has been a bit crazy these days :P).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514809181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514816252","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5566#issuecomment-514816252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5566","id":514816252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDgxNjI1Mg==","user":{"login":"benjamingrenier","id":52801483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODAxNDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52801483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier","html_url":"https://github.com/benjamingrenier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjamingrenier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-24T22:01:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T22:01:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes I'm making some unit tests.

Very helpful comments.\r\n\r\n> 3. Why don't we inject \"airflow_class_name = 'ClassName'\" field in the stringified BaseOperator while we stringify it and use it as the name displayed in the UI (and everywhere where needed)? I think that might be really simple solution. No problems with loading the external modules (cause there is no need - we only need name from what I understand)\r\n\r\nI think this solution is better. I will move forward to add this in this PR.\r\n\r\n> 4. Why don't we load the \"real\" DAG just to display the templated fields - when they are actually clicked ? That will surely cause delays when displaying the tab, but maybe it's better than error. It should be rather easy - you can create a separate DagBag with just the single Dag as \"folder\" and from what I know, it should load that DAG (and then you could figure out and load needed modules before you display it). Maybe that's a solution (but also maybe it's not that necessary to fix this particular tab in this - really - edge case.\r\n\r\nI agree that displaying error should be avoided here. I will first check another solution: whether we can do the template rendering at DAG loading time? So stringified DAG already contains the rendered template.\r\n\r\n> 5. I believe it's not a problem?\r\nYes. It is not a problem since these fields are rarely displayed and not useful.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514820311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514883328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5615#issuecomment-514883328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5615","id":514883328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDg4MzMyOA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T03:42:40Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T03:56:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Idea: Maybe we can simply write a small performance test and benchmark it after/before. I am right now setting up (It already works) a Kubernetes Cluster in GKE with Prometheus so that we can observe performance, and we could have an automated performance test that we can run with scheduler. \r\n\r\nRunning such performance test before/after the change would clearly show if there is a regression. That will be also useful in case we want to improve the performance in .5 - we will have a baseline at least and a way to measure it, otherwise we are in the dark. And later on we could fully automate it and ran it either with every PR or regularly (daily). This is what another team of our at Polidea is doing with Apache Beam project pretty much full time (including generating some artificial data sources that are simulating actual data that you can expect in production). I can easily tap into their experience there. \r\n\r\nI can also reach out to the Composer team - we are working closely and ask them if they already have something similar.\r\n\r\nIt should not be that difficult I think to have such test. I believe It just boils down to generating a lot of bigger and smaller DAGs (should be easy - we could use our experience from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/oozie-to-airflow where we generate Airflow DAGs from Oozie Workflows), then starting a scheduler in controlled setup (number of processes etc.) and measuring the time it takes to process it + gathering some additional metrics on the CPU/memory use. I guess we are only talking for now about performance of processing DAGs with scheduler? \r\n\r\nI am coming more from the infrastructure, operator part of airflow and I have little experience in \"production use\" of Airflow, but I would love if someone (@KevinYang21 ?) who already run similar tests, writes down a simple \"specification\" for such test - more resembling the actual use, what conditions we want to test, what performance metrics we should gather. That could better asses how difficult it would be to automate it.\r\n\r\nI could work together with both of you on helping to automate it  - possibly early next week. We could even release RC and have a vote for testing and make the performance test results an input to the voting as well, potentially vetoing the release.\r\n\r\nAnd that could be a good start to automate more such tests measuring performance of other operations within Airflow. Once we have one such test setup with all the setup overhead, scaffolding, setUp/tearDown working, it should be rather easy to add new tests like that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514883328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/514906584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5615#issuecomment-514906584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5615","id":514906584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDkwNjU4NA==","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T05:50:32Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T05:50:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We
