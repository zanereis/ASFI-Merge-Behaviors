Blocking inside the protocol handler indeed would be bad, but in this case we have to block somewhere, if we want to shut-down gracefully.

Hey @nalim2 thank you very much and congratz to your first PLC4X PR 🎉\r\n> I found some (minor) issues which I think are debatable, so feel free to comment on them (or ignore them? :D).\r\n> I did not test it against a OPC UA device, so I would like to do a manual test against a device. Did you do a manual check?\r\n\r\nYeah now after one year i found this 2 days where a was able to programm something beside the PPEE. It is a bit ad hoc tested. Those tests are in the ManualPLC4XOpcua.java but they access a public test server and the variables are not writable and i wanted to avoid automated tests against a third partie public OPC UA server (even if it is a public test server). So the read and subscribe works for all the primitives  and for the error behavior of the write method. I will integrate later a OPC UA Server over milo as test environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/492124241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/492394559","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/66#issuecomment-492394559","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/66","id":492394559,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjM5NDU1OQ==","user":{"login":"nalim2","id":3216816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTY4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3216816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2","html_url":"https://github.com/nalim2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nalim2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T20:21:10Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T20:21:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It
