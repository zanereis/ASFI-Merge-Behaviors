I made some changes to set the max number of node to bulk to be 10 it doesn't end up using 1 stream most of the time. With num-embed=512, num-hidden=1024, num-layer=4, there's no significant performance difference compared to no-bulk.

It runs smoothly, however after some 50 or so iterations, I start getting NaN's in the outputs/parameters. The data input definitely contains no missing values and are normalised to the interval [0,1]. The same behaviour occurs for ``mx.rnn.SequentialRNNCell`` with layers of ``mx.rnn.LSTMCell``. Could you think of any explanations for this phenomenon? \r\n\r\nI have noticed that the maximum value of ``fc2_weighted_output`` approaches 1 before NaN's begin occurring, i.e. the NN gets more specific (it only outputs one of two classes due to a highly imbalanced dataset). I cannot see why this should lead to NaN's being introduced, though.\r\n\r\n        num_hidden = self.num_hidden\r\n        bs = self.batch_size\r\n        data = mx.sym.Variable('data', shape=(bs,

me reply my own questions :)\r\n\r\n1. If there are multi GPUs, they take their slices from the batch according to work load list. For example, If work load list is [2 3 1], GPU 0 takes 2/6 of the batch, GPU 1 takes 3/6 of the batch and GPU 2 takes 1/6 of the batch in terms of the number of examples in the batch. The stats misleaded me since the batch size was very low comparing to the capacity of GPUs. After increasing the batch size, the speed results have become more consistent and reasonable. \r\n\r\n2. For multi-CPU case, in contrast to my claim in the question, there is a difference between single and two CPUs. However, the difference does not seem meaningful to me. I gave up deeper examination since I've decided not to use CPUs which are 5x-10x slower than GPUs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/287101302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/287101593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5384#issuecomment-287101593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5384","id":287101593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzEwMTU5Mw==","user":{"login":"fhieber","id":2027990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjc5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2027990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber","html_url":"https://github.com/fhieber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T15:51:50Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T15:51:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, is it planned to have full support of float16 in general?

While reading tensorflow paper https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-abadi.pdf it was encouraging to see mxnet and tensorflow performance are at par but the following statement confused me:\r\nThe MXNet key-value store interface [22] does not currently allow sparse gradient updates within a single value, which are crucial for the distributed training of large models (§4.2), and adding this feature would require modifications to the core system.\r\n@mli this particular issue is closest to the sparse gradient update I could find. Is this statement true that core system need to be modified ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/287109032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/287124552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4742#issuecomment-287124552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4742","id":287124552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzEyNDU1Mg==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T17:04:21Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T17:04:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@debasish83 Sparse updates is only relevent if you want to train with sparse matrices, i.e. for recommendation systems.\r\n\r\nBTW, MXNet distributed training performance is much better than the opensource version of tensorflow by at least 2x\r\ntensorflow 1.0 claims an improvement but we haven't seen any public benchmarks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/287124552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/287128700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4742#issuecomment-287128700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4742","id":287128700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzEyODcwMA==","user":{"login":"debasish83","id":510896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/510896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83","html_url":"https://github.com/debasish83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/debasish83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T17:17:33Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T17:17:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"recommendation system migration to nonlinearity is one of our focus as well.
