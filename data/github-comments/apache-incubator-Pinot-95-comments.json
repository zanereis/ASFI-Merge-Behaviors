Yes, you could argue that it can be persisted directly from Kafka -> Parquet via some ETL job but that will be redundant and operationally expensive. Since we already have all the data sitting in deep store (in Pinot format), exposing read API on such archived segments makes sense to me.

I want to keep data like RDB used in normal web development. However, it doesn't matter whether there is TTL or expire time.\r\n**Does Pino only recommend storing and analyzing data on a one-time basis?** Wouldn't it be recommended to continuously store and analyze data for a long period of time (up to 6 months to 1 year) by streaming?\r\n**Does pinot recommend storing the user's raw data directly in the pinot by the stream ingestion method and storing the data for a long time?**\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know you are busy, but we look forward to answering your questions.\r\nThank you.

There is an update.\n\nI think that there is a fundamental problem with the way that the test is\nphrased.\n\nAny digest that has limited memory will ultimately have to lose some\ninformation and will estimate quantiles. That will lead to errors in sample\nspace roughly equal to the separation between adjacent samples. Different\ndigests may keep more samples or fewer and thus adjust when this happens\nand they may prioritize samples in different parts of the distribution, but\nthere will always be an approximation error when samples are combined.\n\nThis means that if the samples are more than 0.02 x max apart, you have the\nrisk of error unless the digest is not a digest at all. The max separation\nfor N uniform random samples has a 99% percentile value of 4.6 / N. That\nmeans that you will need 230 samples before you have a 99% chance of\nhaving no gap bigger than 99%. In turn, that means that your digest will\nneed to keep at least 230 samples before coalescing to be reasonably\nassured of passing the test. Some digests might do a bit better than this,\nbut not massively. For instance, the t-digest will focus coalescence into a\nfraction of the interval and thus have a probability of failure of 1/2 to\n1/10 of this value.\n\nOn the other hand, if you recast the error back into quantile space by\ncalculating the empirical CDF of the estimated quantile, you immediately\nhave a well-behaved system. Your unavoidable errors will be bounded by 1/N\nand a t-digest that keeps 50 samples or more and limits errors to one\nsample size should have the guarantees that you want.\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jul 1, 2021 at 10:42 AM Xiaotian (Jackie) Jiang <\n***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> @tdunning <https://github.com/tdunning> Any update on this?\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/7076#issuecomment-872433461>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAB5E6VIUKHHS5FQAXWXWEDTVSSKDANCNFSM47AL7QEA>\n> .\n>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/872488605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/872543128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7117#issuecomment-872543128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7117","id":872543128,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MjU0MzEyOA==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-01T20:53:34Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T22:05:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/7117?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#7117](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/7117?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (ceb8d34) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/commit/0a020b4558c815490b01516fb41556e6f9420406?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (0a020b4) will **decrease** coverage by `0.05%`.\n> The diff coverage is `76.08%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head ceb8d34 differs from pull request most recent head 1311be7.

From user's perspective, grouping the numbers in different order should give very close result.\r\nThe concern here is that with exactly the same way of grouping numbers, we observed larger error rate with the new version compared with the old version. We want to justify this behavior. Is this caused by better/more strict compression in the new version?

Usually an ingestion pipeline can be set up from Kafka to Hive.

created this request after our Slack conversation, so to expand the use case:  We have a lot of clients (tenants) and require data separation. Each client will have the same set of tables (ex: customer, account).  We need the ability for each tenant to have the same set of tables without requiring unique table names.  \r\n\r\nSome way to indicate the tenant for operations would be needed:  select * from TenentA.accounts; for example\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful if brokers and servers could host multiple tenants.  Otherwise, the number of brokers and servers needed (with redundancy) grows very quickly.\r\n\r\nI think the disconnect may be that Pinot sees tenants as being different applications, each with distinct table names.  Many use cases, though, treat tenants as different clients, all using the same application. Each client needs the same set of application tables but the tables need to be separated when data can't be co-mingled across clients.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/876556994/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
