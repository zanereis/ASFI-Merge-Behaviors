The redundant findBin calculation should definitely be performed once and it will definitely speed up the computation. A couple of thoughts after looking at your implementation:\n1. Do you need the store the original features along with the bins?\n2. You are using Int for bin ids. You can pack them tightly as Byte if the number of bins are less than 256. One can use multiple Byte format for other bins sizes.\n\nI have an implementation similar to yours\nhttps://github.com/manishamde/spark/compare/ent\n\nA slight difference is that I am creating an internal TreePoint class that can store the bin mapping and this class is extended while performing Random Forest computation. Finally, I think @jkbradley is working on more optimizations on top these changes. I will let him elaborate on that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52188362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52190067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1937#issuecomment-52190067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1937","id":52190067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTkwMDY3","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T14:27:44Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T14:27:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"retest this please\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52190067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52190333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1937#issuecomment-52190333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1937","id":52190333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTkwMzMz","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T14:29:56Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T14:29:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1937.

The byte array might be more problematic with out of memory, but stream one might have issues if the streams are serialized and shuffled before being read. For reading tiff/jpg images, a byte array is a sufficient input, I also imagine this could get used for many types of proprietary but small files (spectra, special hardware devices, and the like) which could not easily be parsed by binaryRecord but would nonetheless be useful to read.\n\nFinally for the file closing, I could avoid, I believe, rewriting too much code by just extending the `close` method of my StreamBasedRecordReader object to try again to close the stream. The NewHadoopRDD calls this method anyways using your executeOnCompleteCallbacks. \n\nI would like to leave the abstract classes  BinaryRecordReader and StreamFileInputFormat public since otherwise all of the implementations have to reside in org.apache.spark which is inconvenient for external packages, but I will make the others. \n\nAs for saving, I have code from my tools already but I would prefer to finish this pull request for input and then make a separate PR for saving since it is a different beast. \n\nI have created simple test cases and added them to FileSuite and JavaAPISuite respectively\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52219293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52220220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1658#issuecomment-52220220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1658","id":52220220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjIwMjIw","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T18:09:57Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T18:09:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1658.

As @manishamde mentioned, @jkbradley has been working on decision tree optimization and bug fixes, including this one and several others. Considering his following PRs will based on his version #1950, do you mind helping review his code?\n\nBtw, I'm fully responsible for duplicated efforts in MLlib. The correct procedure of open-source contribution should be: 1) create a JIRA and describe and discuss to work to be done, 2) get assigned for the work, 3) submit a PR. However, few of us follows this procedure closely. Usually a JIRA is created just before submitting the PR, this caused duplicated efforts. I will try to do a better job at this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52244001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52244708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1949#issuecomment-52244708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1949","id":52244708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjQ0NzA4","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T21:07:50Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T21:07:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA results for PR 1949:<br>\\- This patch FAILED unit tests.<br>\\- This patch merges cleanly<br>\\- This patch adds no public classes<br><br>For more information see test ouptut:<br>https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/18561/consoleFull\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52244708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52245154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1938#issuecomment-52245154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1938","id":52245154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjQ1MTU0","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-14T21:10:29Z","updated_at":"2014-08-14T21:10:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1938.
