Thanks for taking the extra time to verify this - I had originally anticipated just some release doc review on the ES side, but this is wonderful. Big +1 from me.\r\n\r\nWe've touched on this before, but this work is yet another reason we might want to take another look at dev docs for testing in the project. Right now we hunt and search across old PR's for test scripts and that's probably time better spent simply keeping a core set of test instructions under version control.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/448307522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/448315780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1304#issuecomment-448315780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1304","id":448315780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODMxNTc4MA==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-18T18:10:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T18:10:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 thanks for pulling this together and the upstream work on the features themselves, I will definitely be putting them through their paces =)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/448315780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/448318346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1296#issuecomment-448318346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1296","id":448318346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODMxODM0Ng==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-18T18:18:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T18:18:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks.

I think it definitely makes sense to qualify and justify the libraries we pull into Metron. To that end, we also do depend on many libraries that don't have a big community backing. In all cases I'm aware of, those libraries aren't the choice between \"existing huge community-backed project and @ottobackwards personal OSS project.\" They're typically the only solution, or one of only a handful of a niche set of solutions for a particular problem. I think the main discussion point on https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1219 was that there were other available solutions that solved the problem well without requiring the need for a custom fork. AFA the original PR that introduced the dependency, https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1175, the only suggestion I would make going forward from a community perspective is to include a simple reason why a dependency has been added, ie \"adding this bc there isn't a library that accomplishes this, it's used on multiple projects, etc.\" Basically, what Otto already described.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - I think it's reasonable to request minimal justification for new libraries, and it's something to keep in mind in future PRs. Seems to me this dep is justified as I'm unaware of other alternatives that solve this problem. I am also very much in favor of enabling community members to contribute to, and cross pollinate with, other projects as Otto has done here.

Can you talk about the rewrite rules at all? What are they currently doing and when would someone need to modify those files?\r\n\r\nThere is not much to say about this because there isn't any significant rewriting going on.  Knox is simply forwarding the requests as is.  This is the same for all 3 services (Alerts UI, Management UI, and REST) and you'll notice all `rewrite.xml` files are structured the same.  The only requirement I had an issue with is that static assets needs to be prepended with the Knox path.  This was solved by making the base href relative in `index.html`.  I added a comment in the metron-alerts `index.html` file but missed it in metron-config.  I will go back and add that comment.  I cannot think of a scenario where changing a `rewrite.xml` file would be necessary.\r\n\r\n2. Can you add any comment on the LDAP config with roles? Maybe a very brief cookie cutter example of how a user's LDAP users and groups will translate into Metron's interpretation of that info.\r\n\r\nYou're right, we should document how this works.  I will add a section to the README.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/449399542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/449412462","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1279#issuecomment-449412462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1279","id":449412462,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTQxMjQ2Mg==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T15:09:11Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T15:09:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, I just noticed that the `timestamp` that was appended to the 'good' message in my example above is not epoch millis.
