Too large losses are found when doing early termination.\r\n\r\nToo large losses are probably observed as a consequence of inappropriate hyper-parameters. In the last implementation, I tried to test all loss functions under the same `-eta0` and `-lambda` as:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (String opt : optimizers) {\r\n    for (String reg : regularizations) {\r\n        if (reg == \"RDA\" && opt != \"AdaGrad\") {\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        for (String loss : lossFunctions) {\r\n            String options = \"-opt \" + opt + \" -reg \" + reg + \" -loss \" + loss\r\n                    + \" -lambda 1e-6 -cv_rate 0.005 -iter 512\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since each loss function draws different curve, optimal `-eta0` and `-lambda` should be different.\r\n\r\nFinding optimal hyper-parameters for each combination of `-opt` + `-reg` + `-loss` is really hard, so I've updated `assert` condition; a new version of `GeneralRegressionUDTFTest` simply checks if iterative training improves MAE to some degree, by comparing with MAE w/ initial state of model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-hivemall/issues/comments/312565277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-hivemall/issues/comments/312571186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-hivemall/pull/87#issuecomment-312571186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-hivemall/issues/87","id":312571186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjU3MTE4Ng==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-03T07:34:03Z","updated_at":"2017-07-03T07:34:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
