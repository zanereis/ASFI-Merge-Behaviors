There are SessionStore code in livy, I am not sure if it is related to \"cluster\". However I think, no matter if \"cluster\" is supported, service discovery is necessary. \r\n\r\nSome considerations :\r\n- This PR is to make livy thrift server compatibility  with hiveserver2, hiveserver2 has no \"cluster\" neither, but it works very well. \r\n- Hiveserver2 is quite stable, sometimes it may down, but we just rerun failed tasks in another hiveserver. And from architecture overview, livy should be more stable than hiveserver2. \r\n- Hiveserver2 jdbc/beeline has a RoundRobin based client rebalance mechanism\r\n- Service discovery can hide backend server instances, and can enable HA.  \r\n\r\nWe have dozens of hiveserver2 in product deployment, it will help our users to move smoothly from hive to spark with service discovery, because it is almost impossible to let users to know all of these server instances.\r\nPlease feel free to
