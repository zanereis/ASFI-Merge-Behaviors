This raises a bunch of concerns about security, especially authentication.\r\n> \r\n> What concerns authentication?\r\n\r\nThe monitor runs as the system user. It will be able to scan with system-level permissions. If we were to change this, we would have to create something like we had with the embedded shell where we track sessions and allow users to authenticate as themselves. User authentication and session management dramatically increases the scope and complexity of the monitor.\r\n\r\nBeyond the authentication bits, one of our driving principles for the monitor is that it never exposes user data. We even hash tablet information, so we don't expose end rows and other potentially sensitive user data that leaks into the metadata table, and potentially out to the monitor, which is designed to run on the perimeter of the cluster. Having scan features baked in to the monitor that brings this data back to a web user completely undermines this security principle.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > The monitor is also supposed to be a limited status monitoring service, not a triage service.\r\n> \r\n> I don't see a difference. I think Admins would like the ability to scan the metadata table.\r\n\r\nThe difference is night and day. The shell provides a mechanism for simple query, troubleshooting, and management, in an authenticated, local process. The monitor runs as a service to support multiple simultaneous users (it is a web service, after all), with basic \"what is Accumulo doing right now\" kind of information. There's even the opinion (although I haven't heard it expressed recently) by some of us that the monitor is already doing too much, and it's possible it is teaching users, to rely on it for monitoring their clusters instead of deploying a proper monitoring infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAdmins want many things, but we can't always provide everything they want in the specific way they want it. We need to draw the line somewhere to keep Accumulo from dying of scope creep and complexity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/489773822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/490119950","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1148#issuecomment-490119950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1148","id":490119950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDExOTk1MA==","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T15:06:17Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T15:06:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> The shell provides a mechanism for simple query, troubleshooting, and management, in an authenticated, local process.\r\n\r\nI was speaking with an Admin and they only use root on the shell, defeating the whole purpose of multiple users.

That's a bug in our code. We are using it incorrectly. Instead of reading the file stored in the cache, we're merely confirming that the file at the URI was requested to be put in the cache... and then we're promptly ignoring the cached copy and instead reading the file directly from HDFS anyway.\r\n\r\nThe correct usage is the technique you verified works from StackOverflow. Step 1 was to verify that the StackOverflow technique worked... which you did, and that was great. Step 2 is to actually fix our broken usage. :smiley_cat:\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/490700940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/490709535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1112#issuecomment-490709535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1112","id":490709535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDcwOTUzNQ==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-09T01:32:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T01:32:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK.

User must edit log4j.properties (or their logback, or other slf4j implementation's, config file) and restart the shell. It's definitely less convenient than dynamically changing the log level in code when issuing \"debug on\" command in the shell. However, dropping this is the only way we can break our tight coupling with log4j, and allow users to use their preferred logging framework (such as logback). This also sets us up to be able to upgrade to log4j2 (once the deprecated mapreduce APIs are dropped), since log4j1.2 that we're using hasn't been maintained in 7 years.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/493136427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/493140859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1146#issuecomment-493140859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1146","id":493140859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzE0MDg1OQ==","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T16:34:02Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T16:34:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have created two issues #1133 and #1134 that are related and may be the first steps towards addressing some of this ticket.  \r\nWhile those issues will not resolve this issue - it seems to me that they can form a cleaner baseline for moving forward.
