IMO, the most challenging thing of using a complex framework such as Celix is to make all its dependencies consistent. Ordinary distribution package does help for a specific platform, but it's completely on us to make sure that Celix will work on all mainstream Linux distributions. \r\n\r\nUnlike these distribution packages, Conan, like pip + virtualenvs, workes on all platforms, managing all kinds of dependencies like magic. The developer experience is awesome, similar to other package management tools like npm/pip. Moreover, with the help of conan and CPack, creating various distribution packages should be less burdensome. Another benefit of using conan is that it makes software integration test much more powerful: we can enumerate various versions of Celix dependencies, the Celix itself, and various bundles developed by others, testing all combinations in a virtual enviroment!\r\n\r\nI made a PR on supporting Conan #401. Please  have a look at it, have a try, and give comments/criticisms. @pnoltes ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1067600815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1067621000","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/69#issuecomment-1067621000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/69","id":1067621000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs4_opqI","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-15T06:40:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T06:40:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is solved by #400.

Therefore, we only need to invoke `cmake ..`. This work flow is CLion friendly, I can debug all tests easily.\r\n\r\nWith `--configure`, `conan build` will only call cmake.configure() without doing actual build.

I think we should keep them running.\r\nConan-driven test can be added like described by:\r\nhttp://codingadventures.org/2021/10/23/github-actions-and-conan/\r\nOf course we need to add an extra `conan build` to turn Conan options into CMake cache variables. This we only have to properly setup options in the `conan install` step.\r\n\r\nFor user's convenience, we may setup a Conan server, and create nightly packages, and uploaded all artifacts (including dependencies) for all mainstream platforms to the server. When a stable release ready, we can also upload it there. For nightly build, I think the following should be enough:\r\n```\r\nconan create . celix/2.2.3@zhengpeng/testing -tf examples/conan_test_package/ -o celix:celix_cxx=True -o celix:build_all=True\r\nconan upload \"*\" --all -r our_server\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur build-all package satisfies an immediate testing/prototyping purpose. Usually, our end users need to do some customization for Celix and its dependencies (OpenSSL/Curl). Conan support downstream customization,  with the help of `-b missing`, our user can easily get what he/she wants.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should release our package to the official conan-center. However, they promote build-system-neutral packages, while Celix is CMake-only:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/docs/error_knowledge_base.md\r\n\r\n> [#KB-H016](): \"CMAKE-MODULES-CONFIG-FILES\"\r\n\r\n> The binary package cannot contain module or config CMake files (\"Find*.cmake\", \"*Config.cmake\", \"*-config.cmake\"). The package shouldn't contain specific build-system files to inform to the consumers how to link with it. In order to make sure that the package will be consumed with any build-system, conan-center repository encourages to declare a [def package_info(self)](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/methods.html#package-info) method with all the needed information about the package.\r\n\r\n> The consumers of the package will be able to consume the packages using a specific [generators](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/using_packages/conanfile_txt.html#generators) for the build system they use.\r\n\r\nTherefore, our package will trigger conan-center-hook errors. To solve this difficulty, we need to discuss it with conan developers. I plan to do it once I have Celix Conan package deployed in my day job and establish a (probably immature) CBD work flow.\r\n\r\nBefore Conan-driven tests in place, I will watch for all changes to the master branch, and keep CMake/Conan consistent with the project structure. For example, there are several big PR pending, when merged, I will make necessary adjustments immediately. No need to worry other developers unintentionally breaking Conan support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1074808117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1074829754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/401#issuecomment-1074829754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/401","id":1074829754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5AEJm6","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-22T07:34:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T07:34:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Add an informative link regarding Conan's CMake Config policy:\r\nhttps://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/docs/faqs.md#why-are-cmake-findconfig-files-and-pkg-config-files-not-packaged\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1074829754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1075074933","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/404#issuecomment-1075074933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/404","id":1075074933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5AFFd1","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-22T11:43:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T12:44:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/404?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#404](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/404?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (c0bc6a8) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/commit/6f1817d5ce14b61cfcb20369ce4fff1f93cba36d?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (6f1817d) will **decrease** coverage by `0.00%`.\n> The diff coverage is `90.90%`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head c0bc6a8 differs from pull request most recent head a4cb88d.

integration is essential for Conan-based CBD. Adding a requirement, then happily including header and invoking APIs are huge productivity improvement. Here I summarized my own Clion setup to facilitate such use cases. Hope that will help other developers. @pnoltes \r\n\r\n1. Setup all dependencies using Conan:\r\n```\r\n(conan) peng@hackerlife:~/Downloads/git/mycelix$ conan install . celix/2.3.0@zhengpeng/testing -pr:b clang_debug -pr:h clang_debug -if cmake-build-debugwithtestsclang/ -o celix:enable_testing=True -o celix:enable_address_sanitizer=True -o celix:build_all=True -b missing\r\n```\r\nHere `-pr:b` and `-pr:h` are essential for `tool_requires` in conanfile.py to work.\r\n\r\n2. Translate all conan options into CMake Cache without actually building:\r\n```\r\nconan build . -bf cmake-build-debugwithtestsclang --configure\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Setup Clion CMake profiles properly, special care should be taken to make build directory consistent with that in previous steps, i.e. cmake-build-debugwithtestsclang.\r\n![CMakeSettings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5362947/161499779-1934fc92-e8db-4e40-b982-494d543ecf6e.png)\r\n\r\n4. Setup Run/Debug Configurations of the target you want to debug. Special care should be taken to setup environment variables properly, otherwise shared libraries in Conan cache can not be found. We choose to use `activate_run.sh` under the build direcotry.\r\n![debug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5362947/161500356-46d0d441-2e84-4b2e-be92-9e636abffe97.png)\r\n\r\n5.

The component service registration is also updated.\r\nIn the current Celix the previous example is not correct anymore, because component A will also register its provided service async:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/celix/blob/master/libs/framework/src/dm_component_impl.c#L858\r\n\r\n@PengZheng currently components will always provide services async. If it is desirable it should be possible to make this configureable.

And retrofitting this behavior before the bundle activator stop call, gave problems to existing code. \r\n\r\nNote that this is not the best reason why we have the current logic, but I mention this just to explain how this evolved. \r\n\r\nBut this is a good discussion, because we also have a different approach for components than for service registration, service trackers,etc. \r\n\r\nIn the case of components, the framework will automatically do the cleanup for a bundle and in the latest changes in master this can even mean that you do not need a bundle activator stop function (see https://github.com/apache/celix/blob/master/examples/celix-examples/readme_c_examples/src/simple_component_activator.c#L92)\r\n\r\nBut for service registrations, service trackers and bundle trackers the framework will do no such thing and instead will log errors that there are missing unregister / stop tracker calls. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if we really need to change the logic when components are automatically removed, but instead maybe -  just an idea - focus on also automatically unregister services and stop trackers and  promote that user not need to write their own bundle activator stop anymore. \r\nTo support this the register service and track services/bundles calls need to be updated to support configuration a unregistered/stopped callback during creation.\r\nThis also should make it possible to automatically use async calls stop unregister services and stop trackers. \r\n\r\nLastly by automatically removing components after - and not before - bundle activator stop is called, the user has more control over how and when components are removed and can for example program the stop order of the components. Not a very good reason, because ideally this should not matter.
