some comments I had from the Slack here:\r\n\r\nI personally do not think Pulsar should allow unquoted property names in the JSON schema by default. [1]\r\n\r\nUnquoted field names break many standard JSON parsers.  For example, Python's `import json` and recent browser's `JSON.parse` both reject unquoted property names.  If we allow unquoted property names, then consumers will need to code defensively and possibly pull in a third party dependency to get a more lenient parser.  For example, this breaks the Python client: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-cpp/python/pulsar/schema/schema.py#L86\r\n\r\n[1] I would not be opposed to having it be tunable, but I think it's not really best practice to allow invalid JSON into a system that's claiming it's JSON.  Probably the JSON should be validated/and-or cleaned up at ingestion - possibly with another topic and a Pulsar
