Processing-time based windows internally uses a ScheduledExecutor. It maybe that the tasks are not triggered exactly after the tumbling window interval causing some overlap. To debug further, can you also print the window end timestamp (<a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/windowing/Window.java#L55\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-client/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/windowing/Window.java#L55</a>) each time the execute is invoked? \"getEndTimestamp\" returns the reference processing time which is used to calculate the window boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>You will need build storm from the latest master and run your examples against that since \"getEndTimestamp\" is not available in any of the released versions of storm.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613002416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/296529835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2024#issuecomment-296529835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2024","id":296529835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjUyOTgzNQ==","user":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T05:46:56Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T05:46:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great

The issue with using * in a java classpath is that ordering of the jars is not consistent.  For Hadoop we have had all kinds of issues where a failure will only happen on some boxes and not on others because the jars on the classpath will be written in different orders and the underlying file system will return the files in different a different order.  We have not had too many issues with this in storm, but the operation was meant to be defensive.</p>\n\n<p>If we really do want to reduce the command line we can probably play some games with jars like surefire does with a manifest only jar, but they automatically disable that in some situations so I don't know enough about why they are doing that.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612966181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/296679407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2085#issuecomment-296679407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2085","id":296679407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjY3OTQwNw==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T14:07:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T14:07:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tandrup

I was assuming the operation <b>originally</b> was functional as opposed to defensive in this manner though, because the Storm code at that time supported Java 5 which didn't have the <tt>*</tt> wildcard classpath support, and so if you wanted jars on your classpath you had to list them explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding \"if we really do want to reduce the command line\", for us I'd say that's an absolute requirement for us to support Storm. We need to be able to see what the different processes are and what the different topologies are for each process, and those fields are at the end of the commands.  <b>Really</b>, operationally I don't wanna accept having any commands that get cut off because of being over 4096 in general, but those are the main driving reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your suggestion (manifest only jars?), I didn't quite follow how it would work nor how it could shorten the command lines.</p>\n\n<p>Here's another random idea:  use the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable instead of passing the classpath as a command line parameter, then we could have it fully filled out with these huge numbers of cmds.  I don't love it since it obscures from the <tt>ps</tt> output what the classpath is, but maybe it satisfies both of our requirements.   Also I'm not sure if it would work via the <tt>LogWriter</tt>; i.e., would <tt>LogWriter</tt> be able to pass along its <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> env var to the launched child <tt>Worker</tt> process, or would it need to reconstruct the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> env variable like how the <tt>Supervisor</tt> would do under this proposal.</p>\n\n<p>Would you have any time this week to talk about this a bit more in detail in some non-JIRA channel?  I'm happy to try to pursue your \"manifest only jars\" idea if I can learn more about what it means and how it could solve the problem.

It's including stuff from all these jars, but most aren't actually shaded into different package paths than the original package paths (in <tt>kryo-3.0.3.jar</tt> and <tt>reflectasm-1.10.jar</tt>).  The only classes that are shaded into different package paths are some of the objectweb ones from <tt>asm-5.0.3.jar</tt>, but not all classes from that jar are included into kryo-shaded... i.e., these aren't included:  </p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><tt>org/objectweb/asm/TypeReference.class</tt></li>\n\t<li><tt>org/objectweb/asm/signature/SignatureReader.class</tt></li>\n\t<li><tt>org/objectweb/asm/signature/SignatureVisitor.class</tt></li>\n\t<li><tt>org/objectweb/asm/signature/SignatureWriter.class</tt></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>This conflicting-classes investigation feels like a diversion from the goal of this issue, maybe we should open a separate issue to continue discussion of these conflicts, which should be resolved anyways.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sriharsha\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"sriharsha\">Harsha</a> : if I'm understanding your proposal correctly, we would still be \"promoting\" the Worker and LogWriter java-main arguments into the front of the commands, we'd just be adding another facility that allows a topology-specific configurable string to also be \"promoted\" to the front of the cmds.  To be 100% clear, that topology-specific string would not suffice on its own, we still need info that is variable between worker processes and topology instances (worker port, topology ID).</p>\n\n<p>Another wrinkle with this proposal is we should do it for all daemons really, not just Worker and LogWriter.  Nimbus, Logviewer, UI, etc. all can have these gigantic classpaths because of this classpath enumeration behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the output of <tt>ps</tt> is so much more visually parseable when the lines aren't 4000+ characters long.  Having a command that fills an entire terminal screen is hard to work with.  I personally really dislike looking at huge hadoop and storm cmds and having to run them through colorized <tt>grep</tt> and/or <tt>tr</tt> to be able to see what is going

Both rely on running on the same host file system.  The current mechanism of doing \"full jar\" expansion uses both Python and Java methods to get the list of files from the filesystem. My proposed mechanism of having the JVM do the wildcard expansion would switch this to doing whatever the JVM implementation does for listing files, which would presumably be just using the same filesystem primitives.  I'm not seeing how the \"full jar\" expansion produces a better, more predictable ordering of the jars.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Finally, I had another wacky idea:  is there any possibility of building an uber jar of storm's dependencies?  i.e., instead of all these individual 3rd party dependency jars that are being enumerated, we might be able to have a \"storm-dependencies.jar\" uber jar that just slaps all of the non-shaded dependencies into a single jar without relocating anything.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] I had to slightly modify Bobby's script.  <tt>ls</tt> on my computer shows a \"*\" suffix for executable files, so I used <tt>find</tt> instead.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612966237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/297315375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2089#issuecomment-297315375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2089","id":297315375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzMxNTM3NQ==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T09:24:31Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T09:24:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arunmahadevan Addressed your comments.

It might be in this case, because you have a merge commit in the history. In the future consider using `git pull --rebase` when pulling master into your branch, this can make squashing easier later.\r\n\r\nStart by copying this branch to a backup `git branch STORM-1290-backup STORM-1290` just to be safe.\r\n\r\nThen switch to STORM-1290 `git checkout STORM-1290` and soft reset back to the commit on master you branched from. Since your first commit to this branch is called da1c92c1f1a3c659532ce03d11a3ea376aa16e6c, you want the parent of that commit (in git syntax this is da1c92c1f1a3c659532ce03d11a3ea376aa16e6c~). So do `git reset --soft da1c92c1f1a3c659532ce03d11a3ea376aa16e6c~`. This resets git back to the commit you branched from, without touching the files you have in your repo.\r\n\r\nIf you do `git status` now, it should show you all the changed files from this branch, plus any changes from your merge commits. Just add and commit them as usual with the new commit message you want for this branch. Optionally verify that the log looks like you expect with `git log`. Finally to \"clean up\" your commit so it doesn't contain the changes from the merge commits, you can do a `git rebase master`. When you're done, you can push your changes with `git push --force`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/297486181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/297517862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2081#issuecomment-297517862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2081","id":297517862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzUxNzg2Mg==","user":{"login":"priyank5485","id":5192436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTI0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5192436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485","html_url":"https://github.com/priyank5485","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-26T19:35:12Z","updated_at":"2017-04-26T19:35:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1(non-binding)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/297517862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613002514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6272#issuecomment-2613002514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6272","id":2613002514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMDI1MTQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-27T01:37:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:05:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

You should use a real cluster with multiple hosts/workers and split the data among these workers to handle such high data rates.</p>\n\n<p>Another option would be to use event time windows where each event contains a \"timestamp\" field and the window calculations are done based on the actual event time instead of system time.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613002450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/298773825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2081#issuecomment-298773825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2081","id":298773825,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODc3MzgyNQ==","user":{"login":"harshach","id":38649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach","html_url":"https://github.com/harshach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T21:58:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T21:58:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arunmahadevan we need a PR for master","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/298773825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612923713","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5731#issuecomment-2612923713","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5731","id":2612923713,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5MjM3MTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-02T22:04:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:26:45Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=roshan_naik\">roshan_naik</a>:</i>\n<p>Sorry I have not been able to put time on this.
