Although I have not added new tests, I had to adapt the existing ones because the new parts are used by them. Anyway yesterday I was trying to add tests for some new methods, but they use the LoadHolder class which is an inner class I cannot access in the tests (or I have not found the way yet).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/622307657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/622309762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4978#issuecomment-622309762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4978","id":622309762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjMwOTc2Mg==","user":{"login":"jujoramos","id":8254001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8254001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos","html_url":"https://github.com/jujoramos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jujoramos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-01T09:01:55Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T09:01:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great, I'll test the changes and review the PR afterwards.\r\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/622309762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/622594523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5039#issuecomment-622594523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5039","id":622594523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjU5NDUyMw==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-01T22:32:47Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T22:32:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"IntegrationTest failure is caused by this PR.

The when/thenReturn stubbing for the BootstrappingFunction spy is incorrect -- the test executes the real code and THEN returns the mockCache -- but the real code creates a real Cache that then isn't used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/624869797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/624908788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5049#issuecomment-624908788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5049","id":624908788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDkwODc4OA==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T21:47:44Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T21:47:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"easy way to test is try changing Region.SEPARATOR to something else, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/624908788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/624910507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5049#issuecomment-624910507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5049","id":624910507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDkxMDUwNw==","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-06T21:51:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T21:51:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> easy way to test is try changing Region.SEPARATOR to something else, right?\r\n\r\nThis is just a first-pass, fixing uses like `getRegion(\"/\" + regionName)`.

I could not spot any of them with all the reformatting.\r\n> \r\n> I would not reject new code formatted like this but I'd prefer that we don't go around to all our existing code and reformat it like this. I understand this is a stylistic issue.\r\n> With so much whitespace and short lines it leads to not being able to have very many statements on a screen for one viewing. I don't understand the rational. Like it looks like variables can no longer be assigned on the same line. For example \"bossGroup =\" is not longer initialized on the same line with the constructor call (new NioEvent...). But it is okay to do this \"bossGroup = null\" on one line. If this kind of reformatting is valuable then it seems like we should have it in our coding standard. Without it being enforced I'm not sure what will cause it to persist.\r\n> \r\n> One of the problems with reformatting existing code is can can cause spurious conflicts with others working on the code. I saw this just yesterday on the synchronized-deltas branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor sure stylistic-  I think I'm in the minority here, so I'm ok rejecting it if folks don't like it. For me it's much easier to look quickly and understand that an assignment is happening  when it's broken up like that.  In my mind, when an assignment is super short like x = 1, then it's really easy to take in the totality of what is happening on the line. when it's x = p.fill(\"foo\").get(3).whatever(list<<object>>.class)- or something along those lines- it takes more time to process and even see quickly where the assignment is happening.  In a similar way I like to break chained calls up on lines because It find it much easier to quickly process the individual actions in a chain of events that way. But again, this is me.

Jake thought that the `--bind-address` arg to `gfsh locator start` should do the trick: if that's a name (not an IP number) it should be passed right through as the way to reach the local locator.\r\n\r\nI spent a little time experimenting with that this morning to try and find exactly where that reference to the local locator was being generated, and how to fix it. Here's a test I've been experimenting with (added to `LocatorLauncherIntegrationTest`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n @Test\r\n  public void symbolicBindAddressUsedToStartLocator() throws Exception {\r\n    // given: a new builder\r\n    Builder builder = new Builder();\r\n\r\n    // when: parsing a symbolic (not-an-IP-number) bind address\r\n    builder.parseArguments(\"start\", \"--bind-address\", \"foo\");\r\n\r\n    assertThat(builder.getBindAddress()).isEqualTo(InetAddress.getByName(\"foo\"));\r\n\r\n    final LocatorLauncher launcher = builder.build();\r\n    final Properties dsps = launcher.getDistributedSystemProperties();\r\n\r\n    // fails: properties has only one property: \"name\"=\"foo\" ugh\r\n    //assertThat(dsps).containsKey(BIND_ADDRESS);\r\n\r\n    final DistributionConfigImpl distributionConfig = new DistributionConfigImpl(dsps);\r\n\r\n    // then: no numeric bind addy's in start command args\r\n    // fails: no start locator!\r\n    //assertThat(distributionConfig.getStartLocator()).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\r\n\r\n    // fails: no locators at all\r\n    assertThat(distributionConfig.getLocators()).isEqualTo(\"foo\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll take some more chasing to find it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/631650854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/631706830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5135#issuecomment-631706830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5135","id":631706830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTcwNjgzMA==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-20T20:25:43Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T20:25:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I don't see new endpoints introduced for `restore redundancy` and `status redundancy`.
