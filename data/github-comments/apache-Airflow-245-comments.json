Please refer to codes below:\r\n\r\n- If schema_fields is not None, it will use schema_fields.\r\n(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/gcs_to_bq.py#L242-L243)\r\n- If schema_fields is None but schema_objects is not None, it will use schema_objects.\r\n(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/gcs_to_bq.py#L229-L235)\r\n- If schema_fields is None, schema_objects is None and autodetect is True, it will use autodection.\r\n(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/gcs_to_bq.py#L239-L240)\r\n- If schema_fields is None, schema_object is None, and autodetect is False, it will throw Exception.\r\n(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/gcs_to_bq.py#L236-L238)\r\n\r\n> Also, please adjust commit and PR message to reference the JIRA issue âœ…\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520076369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520101071","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5743#issuecomment-520101071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5743","id":520101071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDEwMTA3MQ==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T00:18:04Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T19:30:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Pending Issues:\r\n\r\n- ~Add Timezone support to `serialized_dag` table~\r\n- ~We still have the issue of `SerializedBaseOperator` being displayed in Graph View.~\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/62814712-56b0b880-bb0a-11e9-9ef0-0dd9090b624b.png)\r\n- ~Issue displaying SubDags~:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/62814991-66c99780-bb0c-11e9-9a36-f692b2ec3db5.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520101071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520103362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5771#issuecomment-520103362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5771","id":520103362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDEwMzM2Mg==","user":{"login":"ewljmgzbyydh123","id":16793452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzkzNDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16793452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123","html_url":"https://github.com/ewljmgzbyydh123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewljmgzbyydh123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T00:41:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-10T00:41:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Had to decline https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5764 and open a new one since I messed up the commit messages in the previous one.

While flying to NYC I managed to rebase, cleanup and trim-down pre-commit hook implementation for all our static checks. I would love if you can take a look, review and try it out. It is built on top of the CI image (and the scripts that build it locally).\r\n\r\nIt is super easy to install and you can use it to run your checks locally. The best thing is that it runs automatically on multiple processors and only for the files you change in your commit - so it is really fast to run pylint + mypy + flake + docker lint (and you do not have to remember which files you should run it on. And it is super easy to trigger it manually.\r\n\r\nI think if we promote it within community that might significantly improve cycle time for development (especially taking into account TravisCI slowness). The checks are using exactly the same docker image and the same configurations that Travis CI uses - which gives more confidence (not 100% but close) before you push to Travis.\r\n\r\nI am happy to iterate on it a bit while I am starting holidays as this could be really useful to get better development experience.\r\n\r\nOnce we merge this one I have a number of other pre-commit hooks that we can add over time (validating xml files, yaml, shellcheck. tab removal etc.) - but those can be added gradually - for now I focused on having our current checks in pre-commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520167375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520167962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5777#issuecomment-520167962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5777","id":520167962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDE2Nzk2Mg==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-10T17:51:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-10T17:51:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nuclearpinguin

So over the next few months, I will be working with her to improve that part significantly - both from the English/grammar point of view and the way how the whole information is structured.

@dimberman  (and others ;) - @BasPH ). I made a slight improvement to pre-commit framework. Now it is not only used by pre-commit hook but also for travis CI tests (with --all-files switch) for all static checks in one job (except pylint). This saves quite a lot of overhead for booting VMs on travis - we have less jobs to handle and it's rather fast. Also as we add more static checks they will be run automatically as we add them in the same job. And people will get used to the pre-commit interface showing passsed/failed. See https://travis-ci.org/apache/airflow/jobs/570789001 for the job that runs the static checks.\r\n\r\nI have more separate PRs to add more static checks which I will add separately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520384668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/520385868","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5777#issuecomment-520385868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5777","id":520385868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMDM4NTg2OA==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T11:20:48Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T11:20:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"And now it's also locally a bit simpler when your check requires rebuilding of the image (for example when you changed setup.py).
