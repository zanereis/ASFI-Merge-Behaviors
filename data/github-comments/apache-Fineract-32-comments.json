Nice. I'll review ASAP, but 1 quick minor practical feedback already: If you change the usual merge drop-down (above) to the _Rebase and merge_ which we typically prefer using (see https://github.com/apache/fineract#merge-strategy), you'll see that GitHub shows _This branch cannot be rebased due to conflicts_. That means we would HAVE to merge your 2 commits here with _Create a merge commit_, which is possible, but always a bit \"ugly\" and we try to avoid, or with _Squash and merge_ and that creates weird author/ownership metadata (check out e.g. latest e57b7da). If you don't mind, just do a `git rebase develop` (fixing anything required), and `git push --force  vidakovic`, and it will be a little bit \"cleaner\".

You COULD use `git rebase origin/develop` instead of `git rebase develop`, to tell it that you want \"the _develop_ branch from the _origin_ remote\" (assuming that `git remote -v` shows you that your `origin` is `git@github.com:apache/fineract.git`, but you SHOULD not have to do that.. it's super confusing if you locally make `develop` divert from `origin/develop` (other than it sometimes behind \"behind, but fast-forwardable\", that's normal). So, long story short, if I were you, I would `git checkout develop && git reset --hard origin/develop` - BUT be careful, you'll LOOSE what you have on your `develop` and don't already have anywhere else, so be sure all this makes sense! (Just ask if not; happy to elaborate, but tomorrow.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/708069528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/708072665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1396#issuecomment-708072665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1396","id":708072665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODA3MjY2NQ==","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-13T23:59:39Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T00:10:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vorburger I think I get an idea what happened here with the rebase...

As per your suggestion I've added fineract-api as a dependency to fineract-provider. I've also replaced the existing reporting interface with the new one in:\r\n\r\n*   org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.report.provider.ReportingProcessServiceProvider\r\n*   org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.reportmailingjob.service.ReportMailingJobWritePlatformServiceImpl\r\n*   org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.dataqueries.api.RunreportsApiResource\r\n\r\nNote that there is a new utility class \"org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.report.util.ParameterUtil\" with static function \"toSingleValueMap\" that I use to translate the JAX-RS multi-value maps to single value/normal maps. I've checked the details of the Pentaho implementation, something similar is happening there anyway (see function \"getReportParams\" in class \"org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.report.service.PentahoReportingProcessServiceImpl\" in vorburger/fineract-pentaho). Just to say: we are not losing any information here. And I still think it's important to keep the API interfaces free from any technology decisions like JAX-RS.\r\n\r\nI've also allowed myself to reduce the code in org.apache.fineract.infrastructure.report.provider.ReportingProcessServiceProvider. We can use a \"feature\" of Spring dependency injection to make this a lot easier: see the new constructor where we inject a list of all available implementations of org.apache.fineract.api.ReportingProcessService currently available in the application context. We add those references then to a hash map and can use this then immediately without any further initialization or a direct reference to application context. This also removes any need for the \"ReportService\" annotation, because we have already enough information to retrieve the service instances.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/711104595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/711105429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1422#issuecomment-711105429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1422","id":711105429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTEwNTQyOQ==","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-18T01:58:16Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T02:01:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vorburger I would say the only thing maybe missing in this context is to publish the NPM package.

As far as I can see, the code in retrieveImage() used to do result.getContent() != null to see if it actually got an image. The problem with that is that calling getContent() reads the full input stream to EoS - so the image content is then not available later when the code tries to actually get it with getContent() when building the response to client. So they coded available() as sort of \"peek\" to determine whether there's data to be returned in a \"non-invasive\" way.\r\n\r\nSo as you say the risk that this change runs is that there's some way for the image not to be available that the original code was build to cater for. It's clearly not the scenario where the file is missing altogether - but perhaps there's some case where the file is deemed present but no content is returned? But if that's the case then would be interesting to understand when it arises...\r\n\r\nIn summary I think this is OK to merge in my view as long as we keep our eyes open for some failure scenario with missing content / image data...\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/711362015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/711415077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1430#issuecomment-711415077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/1430","id":711415077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTQxNTA3Nw==","user":{"login":"vidakovic","id":380079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic","html_url":"https://github.com/vidakovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vidakovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-18T20:08:13Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T20:08:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vorburger can we merge this one?
