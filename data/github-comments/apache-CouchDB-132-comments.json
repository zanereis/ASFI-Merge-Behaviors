I sent `/_membership` curl request and returned a response with all (three) nodes present online in the cluster.

It takes one of two forks as I see it;\r\n\r\n1) CouchDB's indexing will get richer, or mango will get smarter (capable of using multiple indexes for a query, using information from one to more efficiently skip through another). In other words, to become what it looks like it is on the outside, but is not on the inside.\r\n\r\n2) It continues to be just a naive selector between existing indexes, albeit indexes with the very significant benefit of not requiring a javascript callout.\r\n\r\nIf we take the first path, then neither the new allow_fallback parameter or the existing use_index parameter would be necessary, we'd gladly deprecate them.\r\n\r\nIf we take the second path, then we're making a bad idea worse.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to add `_find` at the same url places where index-specific queries were performed prior to Mango. i.e, `/dbname/_design/ddocname/_view/viewname` and `/dbname/_design/ddocname/_search/indexname`. Requests to those endpoints will take a json request body, treat it as a selector, and either reject with a 400 Bad Request if the index is unsuitable, or proceed with the query against the index in the URL. `use_index` in that request body would generate a 400 Bad Request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2399507115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/2399618410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4792#issuecomment-2399618410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4792","id":2399618410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmUc6PB0Vq","user":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-08T11:45:14Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T11:45:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was under the impression that `allow_fallback` is a reasonable compromise to treat these problems, especially it was the one you proposed and there seem to be an agreement around it.  That said, I do not agree that it would make things worse.  I really like that it goes well with the previously established principles of the top-level `_find` endpoint.\r\n\r\nI believe that `_find` shall always be declarative in nature and as such, making it work like `_search` makes less sense.  If users need something that Search can do, they can always choose to use that instead.\r\n\r\nNow we have a tool at hand at least that can save users from running badly planned queries, which could be useful even after the enhancements you suggested in the first point above have been implemented.
