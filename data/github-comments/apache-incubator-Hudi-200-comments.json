Suppose user did bulk insert in a table created with version 0.10.0 and now upgrades and runs another bulk insert with 0.11.0 where default is now TIMESTAMP_MICROS. Is the type change from TIMESTAMP_MILLIS to TIMESTAMP_MICROS backward compatible? For your example, in the newer version, `1635234243` would be some date in the year 1970 while `1635234243000` would be much more recent. Wouldn't this affect the queries?

i'm not in favor of this change very much, what is the general purpose of this patch ? Do we want to add a tool to construct the pipelines for datastream users ? If that is the goal, can add a builder to `Pipelines` meet your requests ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032176143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032179002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3887#issuecomment-1032179002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3887","id":1032179002,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49hc06","user":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T03:31:23Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T03:31:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @zhangyue19921010 : lets not wait for Vinoth. he has been busy recently. Lets go ahead for now. can we do this. add a property named supportsRetry or something to each StorageScheme. So, only for those storage schemes where retries are supported, we can check the config (fileSystemRetryConfig.isFileSystemActionRetryEnable()) and then invoke our retry Helper. for eg, in S3 this can be disabled.\r\n\r\nOne thing we should be very careful with is in what exception/error we should do a retry here ? If it is a normal user triggered exception, should we still retry here ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032179002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032188207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4690#issuecomment-1032188207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4690","id":1032188207,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49hfEv","user":{"login":"wqwl611","id":67826098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODI2MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67826098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611","html_url":"https://github.com/wqwl611","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wqwl611/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T03:56:38Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T03:56:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nsivabalan ok, I will reproduce the issue, and then share the contents","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032188207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032195047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4739#issuecomment-1032195047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4739","id":1032195047,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM49hgvn","user":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T04:11:31Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T04:11:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot run azure","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1032195047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
