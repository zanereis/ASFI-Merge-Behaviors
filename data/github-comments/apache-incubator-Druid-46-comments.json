`timeSpec` is a horrible idea ;).\n\nI kinda like the `combine` idea, but @navis 's comments about the ordering affecting the processing order rather than the response order has also got me thinking.  As I think about it, I think I've convinced myself that even though it is affecting the processing order and not just the result order, I think that's an implementation detail/optimization...\n\nI wonder if maybe we should look at creating a query with the chunks as Vadim has them laid out \"split/apply/combine/filter\".  We could rewrite that into whatever queries we have right now as an initial implementation and then eventually implement it to actually run against segments too?\n\nIf we were to take this approach, I think that the way you are doing it now would still make sense for the long-term ('cause eventually maybe those queries would be hidden behind the split/apply/combine/filter query?).

Since the druid indexing task is very memory intensive, it is very easy to run out of heap memory. There are many tweaks in how spark operates that depend on if you're running stand-alone cluster, yarn, or mesos that greatly affect how to mitigate this risk. There are also a few tweaks in how druid handles memory pressure (though only at a pretty high level and in a \"please let this work\" kind of way). In general though, Spark batch indexing seems to take up notably more heap memory than the hadoop reducers.\n- Limited input format support. Right now the project only supports string input (no druid segment input). It also only supports passing an explicit list of files instead of the multitude of file specifications supported by the hadoop version\n  It can produce binary identical output files compared to the hadoop job. (This should be a no-duh statement, but is a testament to the versatility of the basic indexing paradigm)\n- Currently uses RDD, there is another community member who is investigating DataFrame support, but the first version will most likely just use RDDs\n  Assembly... I had to package the whole lot as an assembly because of horrible library/version problems between druid/spark/hadoop(spark depends on hadoop) and getting classloader craziness straightened out. And because of that...\n- Its \"big\" (for a jar)... like about 100MB that needs distributed. If you're running in an fine grain mode where each task gets a copy of the jars for the job, you can easily fill up a drive much faster than you expected.\n- Limited version support - It requires some patches not in druid stable (should be in 0.8.3), some spark patches not in spark stable (should be in 1.6.0)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/164513027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/164528027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2075#issuecomment-164528027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2075","id":164528027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDUyODAyNw==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-14T19:05:50Z","updated_at":"2015-12-14T19:05:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Very
