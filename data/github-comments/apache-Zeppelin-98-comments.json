Even this is a temp solution IMO. As I mentioned before, there's several issues in livy interpreter. What I plan is to do lots of improvements and refactoring, but before that, I'd like to merge the livy integration test #1462.  Otherwise with more changes on the code, livy interpreter may become more fragile.

I have an email out to a JDK Developer/Debugger for one of the large JDK vendors to find out why this isn't specifically working. The reason I moved to the Singleton model for those classes is to prevent some bad stuff from happening as there is no guarantee when you have multiple requests coming in at the same time that you won't end up with multiple maps. Also I opened ZEPPELIN-1546 to try to solve the 404 problem which I was able to solve. If you want go ahead and merge. I will refactor the code after the fact but honestly I would try to move to the singleton model if multiple request and users will be hitting the Interpreter. I do understand trying to keep this code simple but unfortunately this is not a simple function. if you would like to discuss this further offline shoot me an email. \n\nI based my implementation off of this and some issues I hit supporting some large scale apps over the years.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11165852/java-singleton-and-synchronization\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/253690337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/253691445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1503#issuecomment-253691445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1503","id":253691445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MzY5MTQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T02:06:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T02:20:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gss2002 Isn't [above change](https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin/commit/4a24a254b21795cae727fde90cd22643a793ff09) use `Initialization on Demand` mentioned in the stackoverflow post ?
