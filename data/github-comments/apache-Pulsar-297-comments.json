It doesn't make sense to merge this in it's current form. Matteo provided some detailed requirements for the quarantined tests solution in the last Pulsar Community meeting. One of the ideas was to have a solution where the retries could be kept for quarantined tests. The rational behind this is that even though some of the tests are flaky, they provide some value to the reviewer. Removing the tests completely would leave a gap and if the tests are flaky, they won't be useful without retries. \r\n\r\nHaving this kind of hybrid solution in place would require that the quarantined test results are shown on the PR to the reviewer in a certain format. GitHub Actions has this feature called \"annotations\" which means that you can add custom test results that are displayed in the results for the test runs all the way on the PR. It would be necessary to revisit the solution and take this into account before merging the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm making progress on the CI clean, I'll hopefully have some public updates later today or tomorrow.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/777250633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/777252004","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9427#issuecomment-777252004","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9427","id":777252004,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzI1MjAwNA==","user":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-11T07:32:07Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T07:32:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lhotari

There are test retries in place for most unit tests so that a test failure gets retried once. It's possible to disable the custom test retry solution for TestNG tests by passing `-DtestRetryCount=0`.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few different failures in ReplicatorTest class.

Yes, I have `brokerServicePortTls` set with port 6651. But `**tlsEnabled**` is set as false and other TLS related settings (e.g. `tlsCertificateFilePath` etc.) are empty\r\n```\r\nbrokerServicePort=6650\r\nbrokerServicePortTls=6651\r\ntlsEnabled=false\r\ntlsCertificateFilePath=\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I do see in broker.conf comment it says that `tlsEnabled` is deprecated (and the code indeed does the only check of the existence of tls port). For \"deprecated\" feature/setting, my understanding is that the old setting should still be supported until it is officially removed.  Before then, both the old setting and new setting should be respected. When both settings are present, the old one should take precedence.\r\n\r\nAlso, after a quick search of `tlsEnabled` in the code base and looks like it is still respected in a few other places (e.g. PulsarChannelInitializer.java); but not in other places.
