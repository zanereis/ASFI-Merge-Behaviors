But without encouragement by @eric-milles or another project maintainer here, I would rather not extend the PR to encompass ASM 9.3 and Java 19 yet, because Eric was already skeptical about 9.2 and e.g. did not merge the PR before the 2.5.16 release. Maybe 2.5.17? I am not sure. But of course, I could easily bump to 9.3, not expecting any incompatibilities. The tests remained green without any changes after the bump to 9.2, too. So I am waiting for feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1090436581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1091651939","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1710#issuecomment-1091651939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1710","id":1091651939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5BEUlj","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-07T12:04:32Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T12:04:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like it would be safe (and in fact desirable) for you to set the `:checkLicense` `excludeBoms` property to true.\r\nThe relevant code is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jk1/Gradle-License-Report/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/github/jk1/license/LicenseReportExtension.groovy#L97\r\nSo, if I understand correctly, it will not try to check boms if there is no jar artifact.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1091651939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/1093053102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1711#issuecomment-1093053102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1711","id":1093053102,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAgdnis5BJqqu","user":{"login":"ljacomet","id":135308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet","html_url":"https://github.com/ljacomet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljacomet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-08T16:14:43Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T16:14:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey folks,\r\n\r\nI opened this as a draft PR as it currently contains 0 tests.

I know Cedric stated in 6668 that this should be an STC error, but if there is just one method and it accepts String, it will be chosen for a GString argument.  This change just closes the distance between GString and String so that `m(String)` is selected over `m(Object)`.  Yes, this puts `Map#get` and `Map#getAt` out of alignment for GString arguments, which was a stated concern.
