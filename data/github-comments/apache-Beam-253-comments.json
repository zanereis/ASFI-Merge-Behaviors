After that, I will be working up a shared fast path for both original and rehydrated RawPTransforms. For the Java direct runner, the only path, as the only possibility for a ParDo will be a `ParDo.MultiOutput` if it hasn't been round-tripped or a `RawParDo` (to be implemented) if it has. This requires infrastructure that won't make 2.2.0.\r\n\r\nThis translation code will ultimately serve other runners as well, and be used for non-Java, so the `RawParDo` will be the primary path, but will still be efficient regardless of language.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/329023774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/329023909","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3833#issuecomment-329023909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3833","id":329023909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTAyMzkwOQ==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T00:39:15Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T00:39:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/13244875/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/13244875)\n\nCoverage decreased (-0.01%) to 69.503% when pulling **af94b7b7a8c0ac0ada222884101ec10127f5b234 on mariapython:retry_tests** into **8e391d94f7a4ddc0dbbc7ec54d42df5b6cb7903c on apache:master**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/329023909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/329024572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3843#issuecomment-329024572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3843","id":329024572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTAyNDU3Mg==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T00:44:11Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T00:46:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Actually, a point worth mentioning is that the object lifetimes are open-ended. Anyone is free to call these methods on a `ParDo.MultiOutput` at any time, and anyone is free to round-trip a pipeline as many times as they want. This code needs to be agnostic.\r\n\r\nIf you mean that the direct runner should cache the extracted bits so that each call to build a bundle evaluator hits the cache, as it does for the DoFn, that is fine too. But I think we want both and I don't think we need to block 2.2.0 on that.\r\n\r\nIt is also much easier to make always-efficient paths than to deal with cache policies (in this case we'd likely just
