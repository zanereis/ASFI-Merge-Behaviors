So although everything else looks great, I have to be -1 on the whole changeset.\n\nI'm -1 on that because it operates outside of the Vagrant paradigm and requires the user to enter the Vagrant password. Here's a more vagrantish solution:\n\nAdd:\n\n```\nrequire 'getoptlong'\n\nopts = GetoptLong.new(\n  [ '--ansible-tags', GetoptLong::OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT ],\n  [ '--ansible-skip-tags', GetoptLong::OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT ]\n)\n\nansibleTags=''\nansibleSkipTags=''\n\nopts.each do |opt, arg|\n  case opt\n    when '--ansible-tags'\n      ansibleTags=arg\n    when '--ansible-skip-tags'\n      ansibleSkipTags=arg\n  end\nend\n\nputs \" Running with ansible-tags: \" + ansibleTags.split(\",\").to_s if ansibleTags != ''\nputs \" Running with ansible-skip-tags: \" + ansibleSkipTags.split(\",\").to_s if ansibleSkipTags != ''\n```\n\nTo the top of the Vagrantfile (under the license).\n\nThen make the config loop look like this:\n\n```\n  # provisioning\n  config.vm.provision :ansible do |ansible|\n    ansible.playbook = \"../../playbooks/metron_full_install.yml\"\n    ansible.sudo = true\n    ansible.tags = ansibleTags.split(\",\") if ansibleTags != ''\n    ansible.skip_tags = ansibleSkipTags.split(\",\") if ansibleSkipTags != ''\n    ansible.inventory_path = \"../../inventory/singlenode-vagrant\"\n  end\n```\n\nThat should (we'd have to test it) allow us to remove the new ansible.cfg unless you wanted to keep the custom control_path. You could also get rid of run_ansible_role.sh and run_enrichment_role.sh (it would be `vagrant --ansible-tags=enrichment provsion` )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/215959703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/215974955","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/96#issuecomment-215974955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/96","id":215974955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTk3NDk1NQ==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-30T15:56:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T15:56:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dlyle65535 thanks for the suggestions, they make sense and I will add them in.  \n\nHowever, I think we should keep the scripts and change them to call the vagrant command.

I can work on it a bit Sunday or Monday. Of course, everything should work when it's over including a pre-built snapshot. I'd just prefer we use the existing Vagrant capability for VM Provider -> Provisioner handoff. \n\n@cestella - I think we're good on a generic solution, just use the regular ansible-playbook command with --tags and/or --skip-tags. I don't really see any reason to abstract that. Not abstracting it has a lot of advantages: it's well documented by Ansible, anyone with a background in Ansible already knows about it, we don't have to maintain it- stuff like that. In my opinion, our Vagrant provisioning is the oddball here as we currently have to modify the Vagrantfile to leverage tags. That's why I'm recommending that we do something specific in the Vagrantfile to expose those arguments.\n\nAll that said, I'm happy to include the script as well. Though I don't agree that run_enrichment_role.sh is more intuitive than doing it using Vagrant and/or ansible-playbook. Mostly for the reasons stated above.  Though, I probably should have suggested the arguments for Vagrant be --tags and --skip-tags to make it consistent. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/215984656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/215985677","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/96#issuecomment-215985677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/96","id":215985677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTk4NTY3Nw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-30T18:32:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T18:34:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not sure that `ansible-playbook -i metron-deployment/inventory/singlenode-vagrant/hosts metron-deployment/playbooks/metron_install.yml --tags enrichment -u vagrant -k` is more intuitive than `run_enrichment.sh` for the relatively common task of redeploying.\n\nThere is enough differing opinion here, though, that I think perhaps the prudent thing to do is punt any vagrant changes to another PR.
