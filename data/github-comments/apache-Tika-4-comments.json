The tika user would directly load from this serialized model not the image weights. \r\n\r\nWhat i doubt is that if the serialized model would work for all the platforms or not. Is there any platform dependency on it. \r\nThe model will be serialized using \r\nModelSerializer.writeModel(model, locationToSave, true);\r\nand  loaded using \r\n model = ModelSerializer.restoreComputationGraph(locationToSave);\r\n\r\nRegarding the offline feature:\r\n\r\nWhen i try to decode predictions for an image offline it produces an error. Apparently it connects online for decoding.\r\nhere is the stacktrace when offline\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/asmehra95/ac8bcfffbc5c1932d38a034d9b486c99","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/293166407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/293358840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/159#issuecomment-293358840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/159","id":293358840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzM1ODg0MA==","user":{"login":"thammegowda","id":1865964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1865964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda","html_url":"https://github.com/thammegowda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thammegowda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-11T18:31:51Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T18:31:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@asmehra95 appreciate your effort.

here are two things we need to put in the wiki guide for this (and also we need to update the TikaAndVision page with this):\r\n\r\n* On Mac, [Docker Containers Don't Run on the Host Machine itself](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35878297/cant-connect-to-docker-containers-on-osx). This means that in order to use `localhost` like we specify in our instructions, you have to fiddle with Virtual Box (which is the VM server that Docker, and Docker-Machine work with).\r\n* To fiddle with Virtual Box, and get it to expose our port, 8764, you need to [enable and add the specified port forwarding rules to your Virtual Box default machine](https://jhipster.github.io/tips/020_tip_using_docker_containers_as_localhost_on_mac_and_windows.html). You can find instructions on how to do that in the previous link, and you should add a rule for 8764 and 8764, and map it to 127.0.0.1. After that you're set!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/297611010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/297611248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/168#issuecomment-297611248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/168","id":297611248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NzYxMTI0OA==","user":{"login":"chrismattmann","id":395887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTg4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/395887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann","html_url":"https://github.com/chrismattmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrismattmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-27T04:52:05Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T04:52:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK now I am stuck on this error (running `mvn clean install` so that I can get a fresh tika-app to test, using `TIKA-2322` branch on smada/tika):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR : \r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[ERROR] /Users/mattmann/git/smadha-tika/tika-parsers/src/test/java/org/apache/tika/parser/pkg/PackageParserTest.java:[40,55] incompatible types: java.lang.String cannot be converted to org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveInputStream\r\n[INFO] 1 error\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Tika parent .................................
