Further, it depends on `bigtop-utils` which is IMHO only necessary because of a java detection check. The latter is probably ok because most people have that package installed anyways if they work with Bigtop.

I believe the directory layout also makes sense. And the patch is passes the RAT too.\n\nIt might makes sense to add weather-report part separately, but after all it is just one tiny file and a README in there, so it doesn't make that much difference. \n\nThe only real comment I can make is about 2 vs 4 spaces of the indentation as we are using the former. However, the majority of the new code is Python, so I am not really sure if 2-spaces indents look good (or even are acceptable) in that language.\n\nHence, I am all +1 on getting this committed, unless there are hard objections from the rest of the community?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/222816332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/222836548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/108#issuecomment-222836548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/108","id":222836548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjgzNjU0OA==","user":{"login":"johnsca","id":406082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjA4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/406082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca","html_url":"https://github.com/johnsca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T22:09:55Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T22:09:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"4 spaces is standard for Python code (it is strongly recommended in PEP-8, the official code style guideline for Python), and Python linters will complain if you use something else without adding explicit overrides.
