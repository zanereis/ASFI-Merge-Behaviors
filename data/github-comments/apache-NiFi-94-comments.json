Yes, it would ensure that users flows remain valid. However, I would question if that is the behavior that those users actually want.

At that time, the solution was to penalize the flowfile and rollback the session.

I think there is one case that still hasn't been addressed. When a user has been granted permissions to the root group, the document title does update to the root group name. A check has been introduced that will only change the document title if the user has access to the root group.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the user does have access to the root group and those permissions are removed the document title does not change back to the previous value. It retains the name of the root group when they last loaded the page. We should be restoring the default value. The default value is loaded through the about endpoint [1]. It would probably make sense to store that value when the page loads so we can restore it in an else clause in your PR.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you any assistance here.

I can resolve the error you get by converting the TinyCert private key from PKCS #8 PEM format to PKCS #1 PEM format (converting from a wrapper containing the DER structure to the raw RSA key via `openssl rsa -in nifi-key.key -out nifi-key-pkcs1.key && mv nifi-key.key nifi-key-pkcs8.key && mv nifi-key-pkcs1.key nifi-key.key`). Once this is done, there is still an error because of `Error creating generating tls configuration. (certificate does not verify with supplied key)` which is basically saying that the `nifi-cert.pem` isn't signed by itself, which is to be expected.

But this process requires the service to have an SPN created in Kerberos and the keytab has to be available. I beleive this is what NiFi calls the SPNEGO service principal and keytab (`nifi.kerberos.spnego.principal*`, `nifi.kerberos.spnego.keytab.location*`) and this is what I was referring to by service principal and keytab: https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/administration-guide.html#kerberos_properties\r\n\r\nWhat you mentioned is the other SPN and keytab, referred to as `nifi.kerberos.service.principal*`, `nifi.kerberos.service.keytab.location*` which is used by NiFi to authenticate to other systems as you just mentioned, but this is not what I was referring to.

This solution would preserve the current behavior, and allow users to \"opt-in\" to having recursive listings retrieve all files regardless of directory names.  There would not be an issue with migration for current users that depend on the current behavior.\r\n\r\nWe could also go down the route of allowing the filter to be applied to the entire path.  That gives the user maximum flexibility on how the filter would work, but requires more regex knowledge and is potentially harder for users to write the filter they want.  This would also require manual migration, but it might be the best long-term solution.

Here are the steps to reproduce for anyone interested (for the purposes of this example, all downloaded files are stored in `~/Workspace/scratch/certs/tinycertCA/originalTinyCerts/` and the toolkit binaries are in `/Users/alopresto/Workspace/nifi/nifi-toolkit/nifi-toolkit-assembly/target/nifi-toolkit-1.8.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-toolkit-1.8.0-SNAPSHOT`):\r\n\r\n1. Use [TinyCert](https://tinycert.org) to generate a *root CA* and then generate a *certificate*. Mine are *root CA*: `C=US, ST=CA, L=Santa Monica, O=Apache NiFi, OU=Secure Digital Certificate Signing, CN=Apache NiFi CA` and *certificate*: `C=US, ST=CA, L=Santa Monica, O=Apache NiFi , OU=Intermediate CA, CN=intermediateca.nifi.apache.org`. \r\n1. You will need to download three (3) files:\r\n    * the *root CA* certificate. This is available as *[Your CA] > Download > CA Certificate* which results in `cacert.pem`\r\n    * the *certificate* public certificate. This is available as *[Your certificate] > Download > Certificate* which results in `cert.pem`\r\n    * the *certificate* private key (unencrypted). This is available as *[Your certificate] > Download > Private key (clear)* which results in `key.dec.pem`\r\n1. Convert the downloaded private key from PKCS #8 format to PKCS #1 format via `openssl rsa -in key.dec.pem -out nifi-key.key`\r\n1. Run the toolkit **without** providing the TinyCert CA certificate to verify that the tool will fail (see *Output 1* below)\r\n    * `$ ./bin/tls-toolkit.sh standalone -n 'signed_by_tinycert.nifi.apache.org' -S passwordpassword -P passwordpassword -o ~/Workspace/scratch/certs/tinycertCA/originalTinyCerts/ -O`\r\n1. Run the toolkit **with** the TinyCert CA certificate (see *Output 2* below)\r\n    * `$ ./bin/tls-toolkit.sh standalone -n 'signed_by_tinycert.nifi.apache.org' -S passwordpassword -P passwordpassword -o ~/Workspace/scratch/certs/tinycertCA/originalTinyCerts/ -O --additionalCACertificate ~/Workspace/scratch/certs/tinycertCA/originalTinyCerts/cacert.pem`\r\n1. Verify the output, a signed node certificate (see *Output 3* below)\r\n    * `$ keytool -list -v -keystore signed_by_tinycert.nifi.apache.org/keystore.jks -storepass passwordpassword`\r\n\r\n### Output 1\r\n```\r\n2018/08/02 21:34:20 INFO [main] org.apache.nifi.toolkit.tls.standalone.TlsToolkitStandaloneCommandLine: No nifiPropertiesFile specified, using embedded one.\r\n2018/08/02 21:34:20 INFO [main] org.apache.nifi.toolkit.tls.standalone.TlsToolkitStandalone: Running standalone certificate generation with output directory /Users/alopresto/Workspace/scratch/certs/tinycertCA/originalTinyCerts\r\n2018/08/02 21:34:20 INFO [main] org.apache.nifi.toolkit.tls.util.TlsHelper: Verifying the certificate signature for CN=intermediateca.nifi.apache.org,OU=Intermediate CA,O=Apache NiFi\\ ,L=Santa Monica,ST=CA,C=US\r\n2018/08/02 21:34:20 INFO [main] org.apache.nifi.toolkit.tls.util.TlsHelper: Attempting to verify certificate CN=intermediateca.nifi.apache.org,OU=Intermediate CA,O=Apache NiFi\\ ,L=Santa Monica,ST=CA,C=US signature with CN=intermediateca.nifi.apache.org,OU=Intermediate CA,O=Apache NiFi\\ ,L=Santa Monica,ST=CA,C=US\r\n2018/08/02 21:34:20 WARN [main] org.apache.nifi.toolkit.tls.util.TlsHelper: Certificate CN=intermediateca.nifi.apache.org,OU=Intermediate CA,O=Apache NiFi\\ ,L=Santa Monica,ST=CA,C=US not signed by CN=intermediateca.nifi.apache.org,OU=Intermediate CA,O=Apache NiFi\\ ,L=Santa Monica,ST=CA,C=US [certificate does not verify with supplied key]\r\nError generating TLS configuration.
