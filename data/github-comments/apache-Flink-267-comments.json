The connector dependencies form a chain, i.e. `0.11` depends on `0.10`, which depends on `0.9`, which depends on base. This itself makes the dependencies weird and can lead to problems when packaging a connector as a jar (as @twalthr found out, maybe you can comment about that here). Also, the base connector module has a dependency on `kafka_2.11`, which it shouldn't need, only `kafka-clients` should be required.\r\n\r\nI think we can split it such that we have a base kafka connector module and the modules for the individual versions only depend on that, not on connectors for specific previous kafka versions.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416960478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/416961912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6587#issuecomment-416961912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6587","id":416961912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjk2MTkxMg==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T13:53:26Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T13:53:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Unfortunately, this only fixes half of the problem.

The current chain of dependencies does make refactoring difficult and not easy to abstract.\r\n\r\nMy question is that for different versions of kafka client, if the API has hardly changed (for example, kafka 0.11 and kafka 1.0), you are not in favor of flink-connector-kafka-1.0 inheriting the implementation of flink-connector-kafka-0.11? ? Or your idea is to extract some util methods (if the other connectors are independent of each other except the base module)? But these util methods may only work for both versions and not for all. If we don't take an inherited solution, it will result in a lot of duplicate code.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have done some common implementation abstraction for all kafka connector test code, but I don't know why the 0.9 version of the connector can't pass the test. I plan to fall back to the first commit, then split multiple commits to change it, and push each commit to the PR to verify that it doesn't break the existing tests and simplify the complexity of the positioning problem.What do you think of this? \r\n\r\ncc @pnowojski ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417007643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417035193","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6632#issuecomment-417035193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6632","id":417035193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzAzNTE5Mw==","user":{"login":"azagrebin","id":10573485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTczNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10573485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin","html_url":"https://github.com/azagrebin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T17:22:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T17:22:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zentol, I think it can be merged as soon as the CI is ok","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417035193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417037795","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6577#issuecomment-417037795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6577","id":417037795,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzAzNzc5NQ==","user":{"login":"eliaslevy","id":725218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/725218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy","html_url":"https://github.com/eliaslevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T17:30:03Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T17:30:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What is the need for all these different Kafka connector versions?

This will let clients know that the reason why the operation cannot be performed is because the broker version in use does not support it.  At the same time, clients which do not attempt to use the new operations will proceed as before.\r\n\r\n* [Compatibility Matrix](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Compatibility+Matrix)\r\n\r\nBasically, any KIP-35 client can talk to a Kafka broker >= 0.10.0, which for the Java client [means](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-35+-+Retrieving+protocol+version) versions >= 0.10.2.\r\n\r\n@pnowojski I am suggesting that, except possibly for 0.8 and 0.9 clients, there is only a need for a single Kafka connector based on the latest Kafka client (2.0.0 as of now).  There is no need for separate 2.0.0, 1.x.y, 0.11.0.x, and 0.10.x.y connectors. A connector based on 2.0.0 can talk to all those brokers.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417387441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417394653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6577#issuecomment-417394653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6577","id":417394653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzM5NDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"eliaslevy","id":725218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/725218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy","html_url":"https://github.com/eliaslevy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eliaslevy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T17:07:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T17:07:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yanghua that comment by @pnowojski is not applicable to my question, because I am not suggesting that we upgrade the Kafka dependency without upgrading the connector, nor that we don't support newer Kafka client versions.

ok now I get your point, sorry for confusion. In that case my objection is mostly invalid, since we should be able to use the latest kafka client (for example 2.0) to talk with all the previous versions. I expect that the latest version should be also the most stable one.\r\n\r\n@yanghua in the option proposed by @eliaslevy we would only be using one version (the latest) of the kafka client, thus there would be no special cases. In this scenario, when we are upgrading from `0.11` to `1.0`, effectively we would drop `0.11` connector code, replacing it with `1.0` code.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking I would be in favour of such option. However there would be two questions needing an answer:\r\n\r\n1. after upgrading our connector from `0.11` to `1.0`, do we keep old `flink-connector-kafka-0.11` module with small tiny proxy classes redirecting to `flink-connector-kafka-1.0` to provide painless migration?\r\n2. what about testing? Should we still test `flink-connector-kafka-1.0` against `0.11` brokers?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417598718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417627819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6578#issuecomment-417627819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6578","id":417627819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzYyNzgxOQ==","user":{"login":"jerryjzhang","id":3949293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDkyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3949293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryjzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryjzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-31T10:50:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T10:50:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ready

They are quite old.  0.8 came out 5 years ago, and 0.9 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nBut AFAIK there is no performance penalty for using a newer Kafka client (e.g. 2.0.0) with an older KIP-35 supporting broker (e.g. 0.10.2.0).\r\n\r\nAs for Spark, you will note that they have yet to support any Kafka version greater than 0.10, which are the ones that can be used with any modern client.\r\n\r\n@pnowojski rather than releasing `flink-connector-kafka-1.0`, I would just release `flink-connector-kafka` or `flink-connector-kafka-new` or some such, without embedding the Kafka version into the connector artifact id, as it will be updated with every new Kafka version.  And I would drop `flink-connector-kafka-0.11` and `flink-connector-kafka-0.10`.\r\n\r\nI would not add a proxy.  It would just add complexity.  If the API doesn't change much, then best for folks to just change their dependencies to point to the new artifact and be done with it.  \r\n\r\nSome testing against older brokers would be useful.  Particularly if there are any features we use that may not be available across versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417708402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/417825840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6360#issuecomment-417825840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6360","id":417825840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzgyNTg0MA==","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-01T02:16:53Z","updated_at":"2018-09-01T02:17:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc
