Josh,\n\nIMHO, it's best not to require a Spark cluster name and the security group to be the same.  While you can reuse an existing security group to launch another cluster, you can't launch more than one cluster with the same security group.  Perhaps a company wants to have an internal-applications or dev security group and reuse that for launch multiple Spark clusters.  In addition, AWS has a strict limit of 100 on the number of security groups on a VPC, and since two security groups are required (one of the masters and one for the workers), this means, that only 50 Spark clusters can be launched on a VPC.  While that might seem like a reasonable limit, I can easily see companies having a use case to exceed that.\n\nDo you mind illustrating the problem about name conflicts?  If I understand what you are saying, you are mentioned this scenario:\n\n% ./spark-ec2 … —security-group my-security-group launch my-cluster-name\n\nAnd then later, you also run:\n\n% ./spark-ec2 … launch my-security-group\n\nThis works fine - I tested it - there will be two clusters with the same security group, but different names.  These are some error cases that I thought might offer and tested for manually and they worked out fine:\n- Can you then run ./spark-ec2 … —delete-groups destroy my-security-group and delete the security group when another cluster is using that security group?\n\nI tried this, and amazon has the correct controls to prevent deleting a security group still in use by another cluster.\n- Can you forget to include the security group override on a launched cluster and create problems?\n\nI tried this as well, and since the get_existing_cluster code was modified to use the name rather than the security group to identify the instance, this works right.  You can’t run:\n\n% ./spark-ec2 … launch my-cluster-name\n\nif there is already a cluster with my-cluster-name launched.\n\nAre there some other possible conflicts that you can think of?  If you can write out the commands to illustrate the use cases you are thinking of - I can run them and see what happens.\n\n-Vida\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51949860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51953660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1899#issuecomment-51953660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1899","id":51953660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxOTUzNjYw","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-12T18:11:19Z","updated_at":"2014-08-12T18:11:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After a closer look, it looks like the existing `spark-ec2` already names instances after `cluster_name`, so it's safe and backwards-compatible to use that to identify existing clusters.\n\nThe code in this PR looks good; a couple of TODOs:\n- Update the pull request title to reference a new or existing JIRA.

I haven't had time to thoroughly review your recent PRs, but can you do some checks and probably add some tests to make sure that all of your recent efforts also work correctly not only for synchronous actions on RDDs (collect, count, et al), but also the async actions in AsyncRDDActions.scala?  It looked to me like at least the RangePartitioner work, while better than what is in Spark now, still had some troubles in async actions (essentially, the production of the rangeBounds doesn't get
