encounted the same error while trying to build MXnet on Anaconda.\r\n\r\n### 1st try\r\nI followed this [blog post](http://guanghan.info/blog/en/my-works/building-our-personal-deep-learning-rig-gtx-1080-ubuntu-16-04-cuda-8-0rc-cudnn-7-tensorflowmxnetcaffedarknet/) to solve the problem by using virtual env feature@conda.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Create a virtual environment for Mxnet\r\nconda create -n mxnet python=2.7\r\nsource activate mxnet\r\n\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential git libatlas-base-dev libopencv-dev\r\ngit clone –recursive https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet\r\nedit make/config.mk\r\nset cuda= 1, set cudnn= 1, add cuda path\r\n\r\ncd mxnet\r\nmake clean_all\r\nmake -j8 # num of CPU cores\r\nconda install -c anaconda numpy=1.11.1\r\ncp -r ../mxnet/python/mxnet .\r\ncp ../mxnet/lib/libmxnet.so mxnet/\r\n\r\n# Quick Test\r\npython example/image-classification/train_mnist.py\r\n```\r\nI was able to run `example/image-classification/train_mnist.py` \r\n\r\nSince virtual env means a seperate environment from the root one, any other pkgs can not be used before installed(linked). \r\n\r\n**And then wired part.** I used `conda install -n mxnet anaconda` to install all the rest pkgs. \r\nI run the train_mnist.py as soon as it finished, and OSError occurs!\r\n \r\n### 2nd try \r\nAnaconda [says](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/anaconda-25-release-now-mkl-optimizations) they have included the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) optimizations (version 11.3.1) for improved performance.\r\n\r\nAs @piiswrong mentioned, I found a [file]( https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/092ff447ceb6ed92c5e8cdf591cf0797e0b8c7a0/MKL_README.md) related both `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `MKL`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr\r\nconda remove mkl mkl-service\r\n```\r\nor set USE_OPENMP=0 in mxnet/config.mk do not help, at least in my case.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n1st try can solve the problem, any other pkg you need can be linked from Anaconda root env(if installed).\r\nI believe problem occurs when mxnet is trying to link a system/local lib named `libgomp.so` which customized by Anaconda.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266984251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/266992097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4230#issuecomment-266992097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4230","id":266992097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Njk5MjA5Nw==","user":{"login":"Trangle","id":3235116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzUxMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3235116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle","html_url":"https://github.com/Trangle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trangle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-14T09:56:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T09:56:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Try
