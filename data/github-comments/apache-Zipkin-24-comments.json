The possibility to let non native programmers edit the documentation and be sure it's still valid is the win of using Dredd. \n\nThe idea behind Dredd is be able abstract the discussion about the HTTP API to the lingua franca contract - the API Blueprint, but keep it tightly bound to the implementation with [hooks](https://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hooks/) and tested in CI (!), so it won't get out of sync.\n\nI think the only catch in your case can be Dredd doesn't support Scala or Java at this moment. But it has precedent support for compiled language ([Go](http://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hooks-go/)) and [tutorial support for adding new language](https://dredd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hooks-new-language/) including the [language agnostic testing harness](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd-hooks-template) so it shouldn't be a problem to add your's if needed. \n\nI'm excited to help with anything.

Feel free to spin off another issue on this if you feel that behavior isn't ideal cc @yurishkuro \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/166795017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/166795611","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/786#issuecomment-166795611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/786","id":166795611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Njc5NTYxMQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-23T03:23:23Z","updated_at":"2015-12-23T03:23:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"wrt your original concern (about end time resetting) I see that this is certainly the case.\n\nFor example, if you start from scratch, ex. where there's no query params in the URL, you can select any time, and the page will return with the correct endTs query parameter.\n\nIf you already have an endTs query parameter, changing the endtime date or time fields has no effect.\n\nThe work around is to clear the URL when you want to change.

Ex.\nThere is code to review store rates under a zookeeper path and then\ncalculate what the sample rate should be.\n\nNext step is to add a test that proves this actually works ;) that said,\nthis

I think the flooring concern shouldn't be conflated with the \"today\" one.\n\ncassandra's impl will take an input date and floor it to a day. So, they can be retrieved, subject to the window which is a documented aspect of the dependency api. If the tests don't show that working, we can adjust them.\n\nWhat I'm concerned about is losing a test that shows we can process data older than a day. For example, if _all_ of our tests look at _today_, we can easily make an impl that cannot process, for example, the data from 2 days ago. After looking at the test in question, I can tell that this aspect is non-obvious.\n\nThe test data should be explicitly a relative date such as 2 or 3 days ago (which avoids problems around any lookback defaults), as opposed to constants (which it has now).

I think of Dependency Graph as representing the architecture of the system, showing which services talk to each other. That function should be independent of how different tracers report data on RPC spans - one span or two spans. But at least in the Cassandra Spark job it is implemented to only build a link between two services if their names come from _two distinct spans_. I want to change that, and allow the job to consider, for example, standalone spans where the other service is still known (from SA or CA), as that still represents a valid architectural link.\n\nAs an illustration, look at the issue https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/917. For a human it is obvious that there are 3 services involved in that \"headless\" trace, but the test expects only one link in the output.\n\nSo that's the primary objective of this ticket. The enum field is just a bit of extra data to record in each link, since the job now knows which of the two services was actually sending spans that were responsible for the link.\n\n@jcarres-mdsol I am not quite following your suggestion. There is no way to query Cassandra in bulk, a M/R job is the only way to process all the data.  Per above, all the information is already present during the main Spark job, so the recording that information in the link seems like the best approach.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/175105770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/175137111","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/921#issuecomment-175137111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/921","id":175137111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTEzNzExMQ==","user":{"login":"t-yuki","id":3804806,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDQ4MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3804806?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki","html_url":"https://github.com/t-yuki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t-yuki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T17:42:22Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T17:42:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is adding new interface acceptable?\nPreview: \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3804806/12589072/4380fbe0-c49f-11e5-8f0d-9b25097b036a.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/175137111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/175247223","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/921#issuecomment-175247223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/921","id":175247223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTI0NzIyMw==","user":{"login":"yurishkuro","id":3523016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjMwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3523016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro","html_url":"https://github.com/yurishkuro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yurishkuro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T21:47:20Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T21:47:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@t-yuki enhancing the interface is great!
