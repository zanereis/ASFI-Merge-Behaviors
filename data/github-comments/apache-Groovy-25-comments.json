You having had to change so many imports in tests hints, that this issue changes the resolving process in an undesirable way... or you forgot to remove that code, which you then should do ;)\r\n\r\n\"the deterministic default imports\" means the cache contains the **complete** default imported classes found by `ClassFinder` , in other words, groovy compiler knows all the default imported classes, so it does not have to gurantee some unknown default imported classes via looking up against all the default imported packages. Let's talk about the topic via some key code:\r\n\r\nIn the old resolving logic for default imports, we resolve the default imported classes by 2 steps:\r\n1) Try to find the deterministic package name from the cache, if found, we do not need more looking up\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/GROOVY_3_0_1/src/main/java/org/codehaus/groovy/control/ResolveVisitor.java#L618-L620\r\n\r\n2) If the step 1 failed, we look up the type name against all the default imported packages\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/GROOVY_3_0_1/src/main/java/org/codehaus/groovy/control/ResolveVisitor.java#L623-L625\r\n\r\nIn the new resolving logic for default imports, we eleminate the step 2 by default because the cache contains all default imported classes and step 1 will them find successfuly. If step 1 does not find, the type must not be default imported class, so step 2 is not necessary to process, i.e. we replace the step 2 by Java9 vmplugin's `return false` directly. The new logic of step 2 is shown as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/9d36f6dfcec2d165dd3dea9b97a2381600a2c0ca/src/main/java/org/codehaus/groovy/vmplugin/v9/Java9.java#L145-L151\r\n\r\nThe old logic of step 2 is

general answers to your question are:\r\n\r\n- use JDK8\r\n- move to a later Groovy version\r\n- ignore the warnings (they don't affect any operation)\r\n- alter the startup scripts to turn off warnings (FileBot seems to have some of this in place already, maybe it could be extended)\r\n\r\nI don't really know much about FileBot. You could contact the authors and ask them to upgrade Groovy. But just having a quick look, it does look like a FileBot install (I looked at portable version) has a `jar` directory. You could simply replace the 9 groovy jars in that directory. You could try with 2.5.10 first and if that doesn't work, try 3.0.2.

We are in general trying to improve stream support and make use of streams where it makes sense. We don't necessarily want to use them everywhere though. See Brian Goetz's answer to this SO question about when to use streams vs collections where he says \"it depends\":\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24676877/should-i-return-a-collection-or-a-stream\r\n(Basically, if you have a chain of DGM methods returning collections and have small data sizes, the overheads of creating streams and back to collections for each step is likely to be high. We'd instead encourage to stay using streams for all steps or not use streams at all in some cases. Our general direction is to add DGM methods that help with that. So we'll end up with iterator-based variants and stream-based variants for most functionality.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/602320299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/602620189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1203#issuecomment-602620189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1203","id":602620189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjYyMDE4OQ==","user":{"login":"eric-milles","id":18193802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18193802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-milles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-23T14:12:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-23T14:12:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can you string commands together as one line using ';' or '&&'?
