The commit passes the full build, and manually running it with an S3 processor worked great.\r\n\r\nBut I would prefer not to add `runner.setValidateExpressionUsage(false)` to the unit tests for DyanmoDB, Kinesis, etc.  They might use EL validation in the future, and I don't think it should be necessary based on precedents like ACCESS_KEY or PROXY_HOST that also use EL.\r\n\r\nThe problem appears to be a mismatch between those processors not configured to use the ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE property descriptor, but are nonetheless evaluating it when they call `AbstractAWSProcessor::initializeRegionAndEndpoint`.  That situation predates your change, but adding EL causes the exception for those tests.\r\n\r\nInstead, what would you think about the treatment given to REGION in that same method ([AbstractAWSProcessor.java, ~line 210](https://github.com/tequalsme/nifi/blob/c56e026f0677a3894063d7d044cef38b63cc0066/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-aws-bundle/nifi-aws-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/aws/AbstractAWSProcessor.java#L210))?\r\n\r\n    protected void initializeRegionAndEndpoint(ProcessContext context) {\r\n        // if the processor supports REGION, get the configured region.\r\n        if (getSupportedPropertyDescriptors().contains(REGION)) {\r\n            final String region = context.getProperty(REGION).getValue();\r\n            if (region != null) {\r\n                this.region = Region.getRegion(Regions.fromName(region));\r\n                client.setRegion(this.region);\r\n            } else {\r\n                this.region = null;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // if the endpoint override has been configured, set the endpoint.\r\n        // (per Amazon docs this should only be configured at client creation)\r\n        final String urlstr = StringUtils.trimToEmpty(context.getProperty(ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE).evaluateAttributeExpressions().getValue());\r\n        if (!urlstr.isEmpty()) {\r\n            this.client.setEndpoint(urlstr);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe client is only modified when REGION is explicitly included on the concrete processor class.  We could add a second `if (getSupportedPropertyDescriptors().contains(ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE)) {...` protecting the expression language from being evaluated for ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE.  There is a similar, but different, approach used for PROXY_HOST on line 193 `if (context.getProperty(PROXY_HOST).isSet()) {...`.\r\n\r\nNow that I've made it this far, I'm not sure why there isn't such an if statement even without the expression language, like REGION.  Maybe I'm missing something?

First, a couple of nickpicks:\r\n* PropertyDescriptor `name` should be a data key, typically lowercase, like \"minimum\".  The `displayName` property should have a human-readable name \"Minimum\".  Although the names and displayNames might be very similar now, this helps provide flexibility for later changes.  I realize we didn't follow that convention creating PutCloudWatchMetric, and your changes are following the pattern established in the file.  In this case, we should be different.\r\n* I found a Checkstyle warning for \"Unused import - java.util.Comparator\" (for TestPutCloudWatchMetric) running `mvn clean install -Pcontrib-check`.\r\n\r\nThe processor performed well under proper use.  So I moved on to improper use.  For the statistic set scenario, if I provided some but not all of Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount, the processor did not raise a validation issue and later ran into a NullPointerException parsing a double from Minimum (in this case).  How about a validation clause to make sure you specified something for all four?\r\n\r\nOther validations worked well.  Help/docs look good.  Code coverage from unit tests is great.  Code quality looks very high.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/300368852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/300390412","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1732#issuecomment-300390412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1732","id":300390412,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDM5MDQxMg==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T06:42:23Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T06:42:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@trkurc,
