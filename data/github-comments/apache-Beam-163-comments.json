this change, `TestPipeline#run()` looks like so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic PipelineResult run() {\r\n   ...\r\n    try {\r\n      ...\r\n      pipelineResult = super.run();\r\n    } catch (RuntimeException exc) {\r\n      Throwable cause = exc.getCause();\r\n      if (cause instanceof AssertionError) {\r\n        throw (AssertionError) cause;\r\n      } else {\r\n        throw exc;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    enforcement.get().afterPipelineExecution();\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in case of an exception in `super.run()`, I would not expect the flow to reach `afterPipelineExecution()`, which makes the kind of test you mention quite challenging on one hand, but satisfying your requirement kind of \"by definition\" on the other hand.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nHaving looked again at `afterPipelineExecution()`, it seems that you're interested in generating an exception particularly in `recordPipelineNodes()`, which other than via `afterPipelineExecution()`, can be reached via an alternative path: `afterUserCodeFinished() => verifyPipelineExecution() => else branch of if`. If so, then we'll need a way to `throw` in `recordPipelineNodes()`, any ideas how to do that?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/291401687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/291422862","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2408#issuecomment-291422862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2408","id":291422862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTQyMjg2Mg==","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-04T07:54:19Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T07:54:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.\r\n(I
