I disagree. We expect string serialization to work reliably on *all* inputs, and since we can't test all of them, we may as well test a bunch picked at random.

The seed is captured and printed so that we can reproduce the failure.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where random input could show deficiencies in our test or testing environment rather than in the code under test; I don't think this is one of those.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/266519306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/266527724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/306#issuecomment-266527724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/306","id":266527724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjUyNzcyNA==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T19:30:37Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T19:30:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I like the capturing of the randomseed for repeatability.

I'm a little concerned that with your changes to the test in ef4d38d, the test is no longer actually testing what happens if the runnable passed to the executor throws an exception.\r\n\r\nI think those changes *do* show that the problem is not with SystemErrRule, since with your change the test passes consistently. What that means is that there might be a product issue.\r\n\r\nI did a little bit of investigation, and I found that if I set an uncaught exception handler in the product, your original test passes consistently. I'm not quite sure why the default uncaught exception handler was not consistently working, but I think it's better to send the error to the log anyway.\r\n\r\nI stuck my changes up as a pull request to your branch if want to look at them.

Thanks for the detailed review. I agree with you, SingleHopClientExecutor was not having uncaught exception handler which is causing exceptions not handled and ultimately not logged. Setting an uncaughtExceptionHandler would help in logging uncaught exceptions. \r\nOnly change I would like to suggest is instead of adding uncaughtExceptionHandler can we set LoggingThreadGroup? The other pooled executors are using LoggingThreadGroup which handles uncauhtExceptions. I have changed code a bit and added LoggingThreadGroup, unit tests are passing.

This helps drive discussion / consensus and makes it easy to do release notes.\r\n- Separate code reformatting changes from actual logic changes.  This makes it easier to review.\r\n- Don't include \\@author tags\r\n- Use `git rebase -i` to squash commits like 'this is a test'.
