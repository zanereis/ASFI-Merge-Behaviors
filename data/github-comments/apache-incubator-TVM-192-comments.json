seems you are allowing `input_shapes` to be None. The input names that are passed as part of `input_shapes` is important: These are the names, of users choosing, that will be needed at deploy times.\r\n\r\nIf we use Torch IR input names, users need to manually inspect IR and somehow remember these names. The tricky part is Torch sometimes changes these input names when copying or saving/loading the same modules.

would be great to have a constructive discussion about the technical choices, agree on the pros and cons, before we reach a conclusion. Everyone is contributing to a common project (and we value everyone's opinion) and I think it would be great if we can have a clear discussion.  We also need to acknowledge that engineering decisions have tradeoffs and there is no true answer to the problem. \r\n\r\nOne common way I find that I find useful, is to dissect the discussion, label each discussion points, try to agree on sub points and rationales.\r\n\r\nIn the conversation so far, I see a few choices:\r\n\r\n-  Ways to handle names:\r\n     - T0: Allow optional input names from torchscript.\r\n     - T1: Only user to pass in name override\r\n     - T2: T0 and optionally allow T1\r\n- Ways to handle data type\r\n     - D0: Assume most things are fp32\r\n     - D1: Being able to convert the right data type from torchscript.\r\n\r\nWe can then discuss their pros and cons. For example\r\n\r\nT0 is certainly more convenient, but it also depends on the stablity of the torchscript's ability to keep names. T1 is more explicit when a user intend to name the input.\r\n\r\nD0 solves most of the common problems, but as the machine learning models move to mixed precision, we will inevitably want to support more data types, that likely makes D1 more appealing.\r\n\r\nBecause the pros and cons are mainly technical, I hope that most of us can agree on the technical points. The main thing that we might not agree on, would be something like the priorization of technical tradeoffs.\r\n\r\nFor example, I might favor clear naming scheme over implicit and thus prefer T2. A different person might think simplicity is key and fp32 is fine, so D0 is OK. This should be the only part we disagree on. \r\n\r\nWhen we find more comon grounds, it is much easier to reach agreements. In the cases as this, one thing we can do is to have a constructive discussion, and perhaps bringing up more people to see what everyone's thoughts. Having a clear summary and dissected discussion also helps others to quickly understand the situation and share their opinions. In many cases we can find that we do not disagree that much after all. It could be a good discuss forum thread.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the outcome, I want to say that we value good technical debates and usually they leads to better code overall. Many parts of this PR are certainly valuable, like the better data type handling. So let us have a good conversation and bring a better Pytorch support for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/643499965/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/643503058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5755#issuecomment-643503058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5755","id":643503058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzUwMzA1OA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-12T22:11:48Z","updated_at":"2020-06-12T22:11:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks

don't have any objection regarding dtype handling in this PR. At the moment we assume fp32 everywhere by default, but to support doubles we need to somehow pass dtype information from user.

If not passed we can fill in the dtype list with fp32.\r\n\r\nI think allowing `input_shape` to be optional is an orthogonal change to dtype issues that we can discuss elsewhere. I've already explained my reasoning, but to reiterate: making it optional is technically possible since Torch maintains names and traced Torch modules know the input shape. \r\n\r\nBut it doesn't work for scripted modules. If names are omitted, user need to be aware of (or we need to explain) how to correctly figure out the names Torch maintains. Since this is not trivial and Torch may change the way they handle naming on a whim in the future, we shouldn't rely on naming chosen by Torch.\r\n\r\nOn top of above, I think it is better to keep the API as close as possible to other frontends.

Now one of @masahi 's argument is \r\n\r\n- K0: Most users tries to use fp32 by default, it would be nice to keep things to be compatible to that interface when adding dtype support.\r\n\r\nAs we can see that K0 do not necessarily conflict with F0 and F1. As an outsider to the discussion, it is a bit harder for me to express my thought(without looking at the code). It would be easier if we can list interface candidates during the discussion, and discuss their pros and cons. There is certainly a tradeoff we need to make, in terms of ease of use, level of compatibility etc.\r\n\r\nI need a bit more time to dig in order to understand the name argument. But at a high level (this is my opinion) I think it makes sense to inheritate names from the source(if they are available) while allow users to override them. The main reason why certain name/shapes are requirement in frontend is that many cases these information are incomplete. Again having interface candidates will be helpful here.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for a discussion is not necessarily argue for which side is right, but actually to clarify the intent, and reach concensus(sometimes both sides actually already agrees to). \r\n\r\nSo that in the future others can look into it. Also in cases like this discussions are also important to find out the best ways for integeration (e.g. not about whether or not shall we do dtype handling, but how to best do them).\r\n\r\nDiscussions also serves the good purpose on learning. It would be great for everything to share the  understanding  of the \"status quo\" and contentious points. Sometimes the problem of the disagreement is not what we need to do to support these, but how to best resolve the situation. \r\n\r\nWe can certainly create followup discussions in the forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/643646043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/643648813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5787#issuecomment-643648813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5787","id":643648813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzY0ODgxMw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-13T16:50:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-13T16:50:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Followup

I would expect that it would replace the code shared by the combine passes of `batch_matmul` and `conv2d` (and to some extend the `dense` combiner rather than the part that's separate. I have been wondering about the efficiency of `dense` btw. - it mentions BERT as a use-case in the code comments but it is unclear to me whether the `dense` -> `batch_matmul` with \"duplicated\" (possibly stride 0) input is better than `dense` -> `dense` with non-contiguous results (though the columns would still be and only the rows would be interleaved between the ops). But then I haven't looked a lot at how TVM deals with strides (which is relatively significant because the self-attention typically has some reshapes that would be nice to
