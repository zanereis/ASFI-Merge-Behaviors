I've reviewed this patch carefully.\nSorry to say, but I think that this is not appropriate for our architecture.\nWhen a client calls `pollQueryStatus()`, the process who waits for the query state to be changed is `TajoMaster`'s rpc server. As you know, we will support multi-tenancy soon. In multi-tenant environment, master's rpc server will be getting slower as more clients submit queries and wait for their results. IMHO, polling in only client will be better than blocking master.\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93780346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93883531","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/453#issuecomment-93883531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/453","id":93883531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzODgzNTMx","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T03:04:19Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T03:04:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @jihoonson \n\nI'll commit this soon. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93883531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93899514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/531#issuecomment-93899514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/531","id":93899514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzODk5NTE0","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T05:56:00Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T05:56:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @charsyam \n\nCould you explain this PR in detail?

The patch looks good to me. It's a great job.\n\nHere is my additional comments. You try to change the signature EvalNode::bind to take EvalContext instance in order to get an instance of a launched script engine.\n\nEven though this refactoring is already a breaking change. EvalNode still needs more information about task. In this chance, it would be great if we refactor EvalNode to take more meta context including TajoConf, task attempt information, and shared resources of workers. Then, we can probably remove OverridableConf parameter from all constructors of EvalNode.\n\nIf you are concerned with a large patch, we can do this work in another jira. But, it will cause the second breaking change. It is also not good as much as a large patch. You can choose either two breaking changes or a large patch.

you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93902909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93916610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/478#issuecomment-93916610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/478","id":93916610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzOTE2NjEw","user":{"login":"blrunner","id":3724310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3724310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/blrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T06:48:31Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T06:48:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93916610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/93939983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/535#issuecomment-93939983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/535","id":93939983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzOTM5OTgz","user":{"login":"sirpkt","id":4968993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-17T08:10:15Z","updated_at":"2015-04-17T08:10:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It

for confusing you. I mean, this issue is related to SQL name resolution rules rather than sort execution. \n\nBasically, when there are two or more columns that have the same name in a SQL, qualifiers must be explicitly specified for those columns. Tajo also follows this rule so far. And now, you are trying to add a new rule. \nThe general rule means that the new rule should be sufficiently general to handle most cases with a few unavoidable exceptions. So, we need to discuss to design the new rule. Without discussion, people like me can have many questions about the rule. For example, your patch allows to omit the qualifier of a column in the order-by clause if the select clause involves a column of the same name. So, some of my questions are, why this rule focuses on only order-by clause? why does the same rule can be applied to group-by clauses or any other clauses? what happens if the select and order-by clauses involve two or more columns?\nI've also checked pgsql. It seems to use this rule for only the order-by clause. I think that we need the exact reason to make a solid rule. \nThe above quote looks to describe the order-by clause, and not much helpful to investigate this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94278974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94321615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/543#issuecomment-94321615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/543","id":94321615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MzIxNjE1","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-19T23:02:38Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T23:04:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh. Thank you, @jihoonson .Now, I understand more about your concern and what causes disagreement.\n\nFirst, this issue is related ORDER BY SQL name resolution rules rather than SQL name resolution. The scope is totally different. I think we need to focus what is the meaning of ORDER BY clause. In that sense, please note that _\"it can optionally be sorted\"_. ORDER BY is defined on the SELECT clause. If you ask 'Why this rule focuses on only order-by clause?', the reason is ORDER BY clause is different from the others. \n\nSecond, let me answer your remaining concerns. \n- Why does the same rule can be applied to group-by clauses or any other clauses? --> We can not. As you know, the other clause affect SELECT clause; e.g. GROUP BY clause will generate aggregate functions on SELECT clause. \n- What happens if the select and order-by clauses involve two or more columns? --> Each column among them should be needed to be resolved independently. In case of multiple matching, we should print out 'Ambiguous Column Name Error' again. I think it is logical. If you agree with this, I will add more codes and testcases for this.\n\nThank you for your kind guide, again, @jihoonson . \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94321615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94324349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/543#issuecomment-94324349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/543","id":94324349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MzI0MzQ5","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-19T23:43:06Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T23:43:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've never heard \"ORDER BY SQL name resolution rules\".
