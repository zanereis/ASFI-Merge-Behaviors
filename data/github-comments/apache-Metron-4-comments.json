I will get to work on fixing the 'websphere.json' file that was causing some failed tests. I agree that a negative case in the test class is a really good call.\n\n@merrimanr, I agree that there is a good amount of overlap between this parser and the GrokParser class. There was some custom behavior needed to handle different log types, so I used GrokAsaParser (which also extends BasicParser) as a model. Off the top of my head, there are several sources that have different log types within a single source - Infoblox DNS, Checkpoint Firewall, Big IP VPN - so we should determine a strategy to address those. I like your idea of making the GrokParser more flexible so that we can easily extend it and add custom behavior for sources like WebSphere. Is this something that I should work to address in this PR or in a future refactoring? Either way, I am more than happy to work on that!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/218462405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/218603385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/115#issuecomment-218603385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/115","id":218603385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODYwMzM4NQ==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T22:00:37Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T22:00:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DomenicPuzio, I think we should address it now since there are likely more Grok parsers being contributed soon.

Sorry it took so long (vagrant drama).\n\nOk, so this is what I did to test this.\nSpin up the full-dev-vagrant:\n1. Do a build by running `mvn clean integration-test` from the\n  `metron-platform` directory\n2. From the `metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform` directory run `vagrant up`\n- Note: If you already have a vagrant machine running and you just want to\n   redeploy code, you should be able to do `vagrant provision --tags enrichment`\n\nLog into the full-dev-vagrant and do the following:\n- Optionally, stop some things to give myself enough memory headroom:\n  - Kill every running parser topology via the [storm UI](http://node1:8744/index.html) to proceed (that VM is pretty packed atm).  \n  - Stop pcap replay via `/etc/init.d/pcap-replay stop`\n  - Kill bro via `/usr/local/bin/broctl` and type `stop` and then `exit` at the broctl prompt\n  - Marvel at the lack of fans running on your laptop\n- Create the kafka topic for the sensor: `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin//kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic websphere --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\n- Create text file with sample data in it called `WebsphereOutput.txt`.  This is essentially just [WebsphereOutput.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomenicPuzio/incubator-metron/af50623dcb764fda0281b3657c0f40c993c958f3/metron-platform/metron-integration-test/src/main/resources/sample/data/SampleInput/WebsphereOutput.txt)\n- Start the parser topology using `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/start_parser_topology.sh`, in this case `/usr/metron/0.1BETA/bin/start_parser_topology.sh websphere`\n- Add your data to the kafka queue you created earlier via `cat WebsphereOutput.txt | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic websphere`\n- Wait a minute and then check the elasticsearch head plugin (if you haven't installed it, you can via `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head`).  \n  - Browse to the `Browser` tab and click on the index named `${sensor_name}_index_${DATE}` (in my case: `websphere_index_2016.05.13.13`\n  - You should see some messages.  Click on each one and inspect the JSON to ensure it looks right.\n\nFor future parsers, this is a good template for acceptance testing.

So now it won't merge due to a file that was renamed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/219264231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/219424532","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/120#issuecomment-219424532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/120","id":219424532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQyNDUzMg==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T13:28:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T13:28:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This looks good to me.  +1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/219424532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/219425116","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/119#issuecomment-219425116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/119","id":219425116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQyNTExNg==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T13:31:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T13:31:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, got my vote.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/219425116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/219493566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/120#issuecomment-219493566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/120","id":219493566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTQ5MzU2Ng==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T17:45:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T17:45:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 Looks good.

It was difficult to diagnose this issue because it only impacted a few users.  It seems that OpenSSH imposes a 104 character limit on the length of the path to the domain socket.  \n\nThe previous configuration embedded things like the username and working directory in the path of the domain socket.  It would fail for people who had very specific platform differences, like a long username or highly nested path to Metron, which would then exceed the 104 character limit.  I myself was never able to replicate the problem until now.\n\nThis is our second attempt at a fix and I think this is the right approach.  Using `%%C` results in a fixed-length hash. Using `~/.ssh/` also ensures that the path is of fixed-length.  This removes any variability that might cause it to exceed 104 characters.  [Seems like others agree too.](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/11536)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/220195558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/220196386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/123#issuecomment-220196386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/123","id":220196386,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDE5NjM4Ng==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T00:25:55Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T00:25:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm hopeful that the README has sufficient steps.
