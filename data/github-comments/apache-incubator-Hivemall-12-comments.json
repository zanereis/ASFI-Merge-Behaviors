\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVEMALL-171\r\n- [x] refactor RegressionTree as well\r\n- [ ] introduce more [sophisticated post pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_pruning#Reduced_error_pruning)\r\n- [ ] support the default value for missing values\r\n- [x] Fix split handling of sparse numeric values\r\n  -

column, then treat it as nominal value (?)\r\n- [ ] use more robust RNG in [feature
