Make org.apache.storm.hdfs.spout.AbstractFileReader as public so that it can be used in generics.</p>\n\n<p>Java generics and making a class public are unrelated to my knowledge. But making it public sounds ok to me if its useful for \"user defined² readersŠ although it doesn¹t really have that much going on in it. For futurebuilt-in reader types it is immaterial as they can derive from it anywayjust like the existing ones. HdfsSpout class itself doesn¹t care about theŒAbstractFileReader¹ type. For that there is the ŒFileReader¹ interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>  2.  org.apache.storm.hdfs.spout.HdfsSpout requires readerType as String. It will be great to have class<? extends AbstractFileReader><br/>\nreaderType; So we will not use Class.forName at multiple places also it will help in below point.</p>\n\n<p>The reason it is a string, is that, for built-in readers,  we wanted to support Œshort aliases¹ like Œtext¹ and Œseq¹ instead of FQCN..</p>\n\n<p>3.  HdfsSpout also needs to provide outFields which are declared as constants in each reader(e.g.SequenceFileReader). We can have abstract<br/>\nAPI AbstractFileReader in which return them to user to make it generic.</p>\n\n\n<p>These consts can¹t go into the AbstractFileReader as they are reader specific.<br/>\nThey are there just for convenience.  Users can call withOutputFields() on the spout and set it to these predefined names or anything else.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6140#issuecomment-2612985383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6140","id":2612985383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODUzODM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-14T02:08:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:57:43Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sachin\">sachin</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=roshan_naik\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"roshan_naik\">Roshan Naik</a></p>\n\n<p>For point 1:</p>\n\n<p>Its specific use case just to support why it needs to be public.</p>\n\n<p>For point 2:</p>\n\n<p>We are limiting code to be very specific to these 2 implementations we should have generalized  implementation.

This isn't a good reason to be changing a public API and lose aliasing ability at the same time. `ZippedTextFileReader` should add an alias if it is going to be a built-in.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pt 3</b><br/>\nWe don't want to do that. We can't expect all the custom FileReaders to dictate these output field names (even optionally) to the spout.  Reason being, in many cases its not even possible for a custom FileReader to know what the field names will be or even how many fields there will be ... for example any format with multiple columns... say a CSV reader or RegEx reader. We want the user to set the output fields names depending on the data he is feeding it with.Thats why those constants are for convenience only and not part of the FileReader interface.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/279928231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1914#issuecomment-279928231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1914","id":279928231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTkyODIzMQ==","user":{"login":"roshannaik","id":2366541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjY1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2366541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik","html_url":"https://github.com/roshannaik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roshannaik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T06:28:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T06:28:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arunmahadevan ...

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=aadi.anis\">aadi.anis</a>:</i>\n<p>Dear all,</p>\n\n<p>I started looking into this issue and want to propose a new grouping scheme that is capable of handling both the skewness in the input stream and the heterogeneity in the cluster.</p>\n\n<p>The main idea is to use a modified version of consistent hashing, which runs on each upstream operator. The upstream operator maintains the consistent hashing ring and use it to map the tuples to downstream operators. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, each downstream operator is allowed to send two messages to the upstream operator: \"increase load\" or \"decrease load\". Based on these parameters, the upstream operator can add or remove the virtual servers in the ring for each instance. This translates into forwarding less keys to overloaded machines and more keys to powerful machines.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I am trying to run this algorithm using the q-length that is available at the upstream operators. However, I believe this scheme can further be modified to incorporate other parameters like service time, CPU utilization and available memory.</p>\n\n<p>Does it makes sense ?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,<br/>\nAnis</p>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612442999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612985424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6140#issuecomment-2612985424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6140","id":2612985424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODU0MjQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-16T05:26:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:57:44Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sachin\">sachin</a>:</i>\n<p>I think you are offended.

One suggestion was to have two methods,\r\n\r\n1. setReader(Class<? extends FileReader> reader)\r\n2. setReaderClass(String className)\r\n\r\n>To be honest, accepting alias and class in one method doesn't look intuitive. Users should memorize the alias (TEXT, SEQ) to use.\r\n\r\nRight now the method accepts special strings \"text\", \"seq\" or class name, which looks confusing and not type safe. The proposed patch addresses this by accepting a FileReader class. I am not sure why cant we directly pass the FileReader implementation instead of the class (like `setReader(FileReader reader)`) and I believe flux will be able to handle this.\r\n\r\nThe current FileReader implementation is expected to have constructor with a specific signature, which cannot be enforced at compile time. IMO, this should also be fixed along with this patch by introducing some init method in the FileReader interface.\r\n\r\nRegarding backward compatibility, if we are fine to break it in the next major version (2.0) we can keep this out of 1.x branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/281005644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/281006746","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1942#issuecomment-281006746","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1942","id":281006746,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTAwNjc0Ng==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-20T07:31:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T07:31:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arunmahadevan \r\n> I am not sure why cant we directly pass the FileReader implementation instead of the class (like setReader(FileReader reader)) and I believe flux will be able to handle this.\r\n\r\nIt enforces implementation to be `Serializable`, which HDFS classes (fields in FileReader implementations) are not.
