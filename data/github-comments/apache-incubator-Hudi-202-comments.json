for the reporting @melin , actually hoodie already implemented this feature already since release 0.9, we add a metadata field named `__hoodie_operation` to record the per-record change flag. And hoodie can consume CDC and be read a CDC source both through Flink engine already. The spark engine should follow in this feature soon.\r\n\r\nBut like you said, we should  have a more general solution, let's say hoodie would support CDC logs not only for CDC source, but appending logs too, the RFC is coming soon

Compared to other data lake formats, delta restricts to involve dependencies other than spark, the [delta-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.delta/delta-core_2.12/1.1.0) has only one transitive dependency `jackson-core-asl` which is not included in spark runtime jars. Iceberg provides `runtime` jar which is something like Hudi bundle jars but has such differences:\r\n1. The iceberg runtime jar does not contain classes that already exist in spark runtime libraries, e.g. `curator`\r\n2. The iceberg runtime jar relocates nearly every class other than `org.apache.iceberg` package to avoid potential class conflict with user classes.\r\n3. The iceberg provides runtime jars for each supported spark minor version, e.g. [`iceberg-spark-runtime-0.13.0.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/iceberg/iceberg-spark-runtime/0.13.0/iceberg-spark-runtime-0.13.0.jar) for spark 2.4.x, [`iceberg-spark3-runtime-0.13.0.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/iceberg/iceberg-spark3-runtime/0.13.0/iceberg-spark3-runtime-0.13.0.jar) from spark 3.0.x, [`iceberg-spark-runtime-3.1_2.12-0.13.0.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/iceberg/iceberg-spark-runtime-3.1_2.12/0.13.0/iceberg-spark-runtime-3.1_2.12-0.13.0.jar) for spark 3.1.x, [`iceberg-spark-runtime-3.2_2.12-0.13.0.jar`](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/iceberg/iceberg-spark-runtime-3.2_2.12/0.13.0/iceberg-spark-runtime-3.2_2.12-0.13.0.jar) for spark 3.2.x","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1038016578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1038066959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4800#issuecomment-1038066959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4800","id":1038066959,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4936UP","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-13T12:16:11Z","updated_at":"2022-02-13T12:16:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @nsivabalan Thanks for the fix. Quick comment before reviewing the diff: Is there a particular reason for choosing lastUpdatedTime instead of the HoodieInstant itself like you pointed out in your proposal ? To reduce complexity of understanding, I feel comparing HoodieInstants choice is better but I'd like to understand your reasoning.\r\n\r\n@nsivabalan I had similar view to what @n3nash was asking here. The problem boils down to a cache invalidation issue: the local timeline view is a cache and we need to compare some timestamps to decide whether to invalidate the cache and reload the timeline view or not. So to avoid unnecessary complexity, is there any strong reason why instant time can't be used here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1038066959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1038104078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4800#issuecomment-1038104078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4800","id":1038104078,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM494DYO","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-13T13:09:07Z","updated_at":"2022-02-13T13:09:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xushiyan @n3nash :\r\nI put up a patch as is what I got from the community user. and I heard that its being already run in prod if I am not wrong. so, went ahead and put up a patch. atleast I wanted to have discussions on both approaches. \r\nbut as I mentioned in the description, I am also inclined towards using lastInstantTime which makes sense. Will go ahead and fix the patch. \r\n\r\n@danny0405 : we need to think more about cleaning not triggering any refresh. If I am not wrong, none of the apis in FileSystemView knows for which operation it is being executed for (for eg, getLatestBaseFiles). So, ignoring the timeline refresh just for cleaning will mean that we leak such information to the FileSystemView which needs some thinking. I am to take a look at the code to see how this might pan out. Will keep you posted. \r\nbut thanks for bringing up a good point. appreciate it. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1038104078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1038163809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4781#issuecomment-1038163809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4781","id":1038163809,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM494R9h","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-13T14:40:20Z","updated_at":"2022-02-13T14:40:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @yihua I see you changed many code styles e.g. import order, indent.
