Then we iterator through the list and check if this flag exists. If it does, then we add it to the result ${TVM_WARNING_FLAGS}.\r\n\r\nThen, from the outside users' perspective, it is a cross-platform way to provide a list of warning flags, which is very cmake

Is that possible to move the pass before partitioning but after merge compiler region (like `PruneTesnorRTCompilerRegion`)? After the merge compiler region pass you should get the Relay graph with almost the same semantic as partitioning. If you could have a pass checking each compiler region for your constraints, you can probably just remove the region you don't want, so that you should get only valid partitioned functions.\r\n\r\nHmm, this seems like it would make the job of the `PruneTensorRTSubgraph` pass much more difficult. `PartitionGraph` already takes care of collecting the inputs and outputs of a subgraph and additional processing such as making sure there are no duplicate outputs. If `PruneTesnorRTCompilerRegion` was before `PartitionGraph`, it would have to duplicate a lot of that work. The idea of the pruning pass is that we should present each backend with the final subgraph exactly as it would be when it is passed to the codegen and the backend should decide if it is valid or not. Are you concerned about the overhead of partitioning a subgraph which would be later discarded?\r\n\r\nBtw just for referece, here is the general implementation of PruneSubgraph that I originally implemented: https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm/commit/06015a4617cfaad56adcaa0c71b485d6bd711128\r\n\r\n> 3. Can the TensorRT version be obtained via an API call in C++? Something like `tensorrt::get_version()`? If so you can register a global symbol and pass the version to Python so that it can be used by the annotator.  If you need manually set up the TensorRT version, then it could be like this: Let user specify it in `config.cmake` and we pass the value to a macro in C++ so that you could simply return the value. The drawback of this solution is that it needs to rebuild TVM to annotate different TensorRT versions, and I'm not sure if that makes sense to you.\r\n\r\nI have already created an API to retrieve the TRT version if TVM is compiled with the TRT runtime enabled. However, one of our use cases is to use TVM on a CPU-only instance to cross-compile models. For that use case, we want to be able to target compilation for different TRT versions - this affects the partitioning rules mostly. I don't think having to rebuild TVM for each target version will be a good solution.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for my annotation functions to access the pass context and therefore a TRT config that I will be adding as @masahi suggested?

If `PruneTesnorRTCompilerRegion` was before `PartitionGraph`, it would have to duplicate a lot of that work. The idea of the pruning pass is that we should present each backend with the final subgraph exactly as it would be when it is passed to the codegen and the backend should decide if it is valid or not. Are you concerned about the overhead of partitioning a subgraph which would be later discarded?\r\n> > Btw just for referece, here is the general implementation of PruneSubgraph that I originally implemented: [trevor-m@06015a4](https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm/commit/06015a4617cfaad56adcaa0c71b485d6bd711128)\r\n> \r\n> My main concern was that it would be tedious to have a `partition_graph -> revert_some_partitions` flow. Also in this case, your post-processing pass depends on the partition pass and may fail along with the change of the partition pass. If this requirement is important, I'd even prefer to add post-processing feature to the partition pass that allows you to provide a packed function to check if a partitioned function is valid.\r\n> \r\n> On the other hand, in order to not block this PR for too long, we can maybe follow the current flow first, and discuss a plan of refactoring the partition pass to better support this requirement.\r\n> \r\n> @zhiics do you have any suggestion?\r\n\r\nYeah, I think its okay to have a refinement pass for TRT ATM since doing such a decision in the current partitioning is not easy. In the long run, we should make the partitioning pass more intelligent by taking in some configurations and partitioning over the region accordingly. Or we can consider some of the configs when merging the regions. That would need more investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/692328667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/692337935","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6456#issuecomment-692337935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6456","id":692337935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjMzNzkzNQ==","user":{"login":"rkimball","id":15673563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjczNTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15673563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball","html_url":"https://github.com/rkimball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T22:03:19Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T22:03:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"-Wextra and disabling unused-parameter adds only a single deprected-copy warning that would be easy to fix.\r\n-Wpedantic and disabling extra-semi adds gnu-anonymous-struct and nested-anon-types.\r\nWe could just enable individual warnings we are interested in.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/692337935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/692365187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6449#issuecomment-692365187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6449","id":692365187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjM2NTE4Nw==","user":{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T23:08:00Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T23:08:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"E2E tests added.

Is moving to fully dynamic frontend like being done for onnx #6351 help removing infer_value usage?\r\n\r\nWhile we try to make relay expression as static as possible, a lot of work can still only be done in frontend. For these cases we still need to use _infer_value. This happens a lot for tf/pt od models. For some simple ops such as topk, we can directly use dyn namespace op and eliminate _infer_value. Later when we gradually improve dynamic ops it's possible to eliminate more _infer_values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/692392769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/692398165","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6108#issuecomment-692398165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6108","id":692398165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjM5ODE2NQ==","user":{"login":"yongwww","id":10205827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA1ODI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10205827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww","html_url":"https://github.com/yongwww","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T01:03:45Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T01:03:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lsy643 thanks for sharing the results. What I am wondering is the latency of your change vs previous nms gpu version (even the output is not identical), and probably the perf number of your change vs TensorFlow baseline. As Leyuan mentioned above, the thread related change might cause performance regression, performance matters a lot for us, so we would like to see some perf number about this. If performance regression does exist, then it should be fixed.

Thanks I'm trying running e2e on my end.

If it is too slow, it might not be a good idea to run them on CI...\r\n\r\n2. Interestingly, mask rcnn seems to have `prim::Loop`, even though it is traced. In general, does tracing make sense for object detection models (that might have data dependent code path)?
