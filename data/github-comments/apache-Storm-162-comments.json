The only reason to do one over the other would be performance vs readability.  In my very unscientific test<br/>\n    ```<br/>\n    public class Test {<br/>\npublic static int toPositive(int number) </p>\n{\n    return number & Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n}\n\n<p>public static void main(String [] args) {<br/>\n    int count = Integer.valueOf(args<span class=\"error\">&#91;0&#93;</span>);<br/>\n    long start = System.nanoTime();<br/>\n    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) </p>\n{\nint ret = Math.abs(i);\n//int ret = toPositive(i);\n    }\n<p>    long end = System.nanoTime();<br/>\n    System.out.println(end+\" - \"+ start+\" = \"<ins>(end-start)</ins>\" rate: \"+(((double)count)/(end-start)));<br/>\n}<br/>\n    }<br/>\n    ```<br/>\n    I get about 291 ops per nanosecond for toPositive</p>\n\n<p>    `1453216134803090000 - 1453216134799657000 = 3433000 rate: 291.29041654529567`</p>\n\n<p>    and 289 ops per nanosecond for Math.abs<br/>\n    `1453216159561620000 - 1453216159558157000 = 3463000 rate: 288.7669650591972`</p>\n\n<p>    To me it is such a small difference About 1% over a part of the code where computing the hash code dominates that it should come down to readability.  Both look equally as readable to me (because of the comments on toPositive).</p>\n\n<p>    I am +1 for this change.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612702615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612698398","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5290#issuecomment-2612698398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5290","id":2612698398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2OTgzOTg=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T16:17:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:43:35Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user abhishekagarwal87 opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1026\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1026</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1455\" title=\"kafka spout should not reset to the beginning of partition when offsetoutofrange exception occurs\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1455\"><del>STORM-1455</del></a>: Do not reset the emittedOffset for offsetOutOfRangeExceptions</p>\n\n<p>    There are two changes in this PR </p>\n\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>If there is a TopicOffsetOutOfRangeException, it can be due to an old failed tuple.

\nI am not sure that we have had much in the way of collaboration in the past, so if others have suggestions on this that would be great.\n\nI personally think that first we need to define the goals of each person involved here so we can be sure to know what features are needed to declare this done.  We can divide different features up into smaller pieces/JIRA that can be done independently if that is simpler.\n\nSTORM-822 talks about using the kafka 0.8.3 API, not the 0.9.0 API, and that is it (I assume that they are the same and a version number was changed before release).  Hence the need to better define what STORM-822 is intended to cover.\n\nSo from my perspective the minimum goals that I have for a 0.9.0 API Spout is\n- It needs to support at least once processing correctly\n- It needs to support at most once processing correctly (or at least as well as the previous spout did)\n- it needs to support the security APIs\n\nBefore we can remove the old spout though it also needs to support the same functionality.  Not necessarily a drop in replacement (Although that would be nice too).\n\n@hmcl @tgravescs @erikdw @Deepnekroz @harshach what are the requirements that you have?  Once we know the requirements we can add them to STORM-822, setup a plan a file subtasks for the different parts of the plan, ideally with dependencies.\n\nI personally don't want to run the show in coordinating this.  I am up to my eyeballs in 1.x/JStorm, so if someone else here wants to volunteer to help coordinate things that would be great.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/173227353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/173233553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/994#issuecomment-173233553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/994","id":173233553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzIzMzU1Mw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-20T15:13:26Z","updated_at":"2016-01-20T15:13:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It sounds like everyone is fine with the current set of incompatibilities, so it comes down to a documentation issue.
