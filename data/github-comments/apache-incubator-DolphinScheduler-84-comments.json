have solved the problem, but I find it very strange\r\n\r\n> Can you provide a complete log, preferably not using pictures\r\n\r\nOh, I've solved this problem, but I find it puzzling, and it goes like this:\r\n\r\nBased on the stable version 1.3.3, I added LDAP authentication.In the \"org.apache.dolphinscheduler.api.security.SecurityConfig\" this class, I've added a configuration item (by `@ Value (\" ${ldap. Url} \")` way to read the \"application-api.properties\" in the configuration file is the Value), as shown in the figure below\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41062250/101754153-611fff80-3b0e-11eb-9c47-90e222b98791.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41062250/101754241-7ac14700-3b0e-11eb-8b39-212a7964e51e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41062250/101754475-be1bb580-3b0e-11eb-8cd2-eda3d1937081.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem was with this configuration, when I changed the name of the configuration to `ldap.addr`, the problem was solved.😂😂😂\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41062250/101754523-cb38a480-3b0e-11eb-9553-24aa7797c58b.png)\r\n\r\nI am very surprised what is the relationship between the configuration of `ldap.url` and the Master node, why this configuration causes the Master node to report an error, and this problem does not appear when I do not click to execute the task, the user can log in through LDAP normally Authentication, only when I click on an online task and run it, the Master node will report an error frantically and log, which makes it difficult for me to understand.\r\n\r\nI guess the program treats this configuration as a database connection string?\r\n\r\n---\r\n这个问题我已经解决了，但是对这个问题我很费解，它是这样的\r\n基于1.3.3稳定版本，我增加了基于LDAP认证的功能。在\"org.apache.dolphinscheduler.api.security.SecurityConfig\"这个类中，我增加了一个配置项(通过`@ Value (\" ${ldap. Url} \")`的方式读取\"application-api.properties\"这个配置文件中的值)，如下图所示。\r\n问题就出在这个配置上，当我把这个配置的名称改为`ldap.addr`，问题就解决了。😂😂😂\r\n\r\n我很好奇这个配置和Master节点有什么关系，为什么这个配置会导致Master节点报错，而且，这个问题在我不点击执行任务的时候是没有问题的，用户可以正常登陆通过LDAP身份认证，只有当我点击某个在线的任务并运行它，Master节点就会疯狂的报错，输入日志，这让我很费解。。。\r\n\r\n我猜想是程序把这个配置当成了一个数据库连接串吗？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/742413123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/742416460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4194#issuecomment-742416460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/4194","id":742416460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MjQxNjQ2MA==","user":{"login":"CrazyBeeline","id":25030234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDMwMjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25030234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyBeeline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyBeeline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-10T10:01:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T10:01:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我用了官方提供的lib，替换了hadoop和hive的jar包
