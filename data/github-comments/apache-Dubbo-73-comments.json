part is performance tests,because i need to consider the effects of the gc、jit especially the hit rate.details in

demo](https://github.com/dugenkui03/java-source-code/blob/master/src/test/java/dubbo/cache/Performance.java) can demonstrate that  ReadWriteLock is faster than ReentrantLock .i have add some

Protostuff is a wrapper library that can use many different serialization formats. It also supports runtime schema generation, which you appear to be using. That runtime schema requires sending extra metadata along with the message to tell the receiver about the message's schema. I would guess that the large message you're seeing is mostly from this runtime schema data.\r\n\r\n> With standard Protobuf, the schema is not sent with the message because it is assumed that the sender and recipient already agree on a schema provided by a .proto file compiled into both programs. If you use Protobuf with a standard .proto file, you'll find that the messages it produces are much smaller than JSON.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/429192320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/429194307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/2636#issuecomment-429194307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2636","id":429194307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTE5NDMwNw==","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-12T03:39:51Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T03:39:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If
