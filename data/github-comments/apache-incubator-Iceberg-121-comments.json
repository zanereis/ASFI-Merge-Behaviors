Adding more complexity here reduces the chances that we will be able to get the interfaces added to Spark, so I would prefer not to add too much here that risks not being able to move it upstream.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I'm not sure that this fits with how code is plugged into Spark. I think that stored procedures should be added through a catalog that can define them. Catalogs are the primary way to plug things like this into Spark, so I'm not sure why Spark would support a second way to plug in specific procedures. How a catalog manages procedures is up to the implementation. We could add this as an Iceberg catalog feature, but then this may be different. So we should first clarify: is this an Iceberg-only feature or is this something that would go upstream?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/951337115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/951371446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3351#issuecomment-951371446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3351","id":951371446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX844tMa2","user":{"login":"kbendick","id":9833362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzMzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9833362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick","html_url":"https://github.com/kbendick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbendick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-25T22:10:01Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T22:10:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > I’m hesitant to include this for 0.12.1\r\n> \r\n> I didn't want to go this into 0.12.1 as well :)\r\n> \r\n> I'll try and take a look at those assumptions as well.

I see the entire `0.12.0` directory being created to store the `0.12.0` version of the doc. I wonder if we should do that, historically we have been doing this for javadoc which has led to a lot of code search issues in Intellij. I think a better way we can organize the doc is through the build and release process, so that in every release, checkout the historical release tags to copy the `site` to the correct version directory, and then release the website. But the source code always only contain 1 copy of the latest doc.\r\n\r\nI also think the current refactoring also lacks a `latest` version, which displays the latest view of the docs. We should not map `/` to `/0.12.0`, but instead to `/latest` because we might have multiple releases of the website before the next new code version release.\r\n\r\nFrom PR perspective, my opinion is that we can separate this to 2 PRs, 1 for style changes which I really like, another one for structural change that might potentially involve many files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/952220260/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/952261458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3378#issuecomment-952261458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3378","id":952261458,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX844wltS","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T19:43:03Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T19:43:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I hadn't considered including previous versions by copying in each branch, that's a great idea!

It does not affect any Iceberg specific features, those are always controlled by the compute engine. Now we are saying that the `NessieCatalog` itself is more or less a compute engine that has its own list of unique features that other catalog cannot use. This is a big shift of the Iceberg catalog concept, and people can no longer easily switch across different implementations because of these catalog-specific procedures. it almost feel to me that Nessie should just implement another `NessieSparkCatalog` for Nessie users, and you can freely add all the extensions you'd like to have. Or we should try to push it as a Spark feature to easily register procedures from not a single but multiple sources.\r\n\r\nI am also curious what approach you are taking for Delta Lake. They also have `io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension`, are you also adding a similar hook on their side?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/952399204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/952400896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3378#issuecomment-952400896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3378","id":952400896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX844xHwA","user":{"login":"samredai","id":43911210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTExMjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43911210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai","html_url":"https://github.com/samredai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samredai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T23:16:02Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T23:16:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jackye1995 agreed we should combine this effort with the effort to version the javadoc.
