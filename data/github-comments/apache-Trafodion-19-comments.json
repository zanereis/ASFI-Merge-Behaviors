Hans,\nI cannot find a good way to do converting automatically. The current implicit converting is triggered only  when source and target data column charset is different. So if we can change HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET, which control the source charset, it will do an automatic converting with current code base. But since change that will have side-effect, so that is not supposed to change. Then the current implicit converting code will not be triggered.\nIn this case, I think ask the admin to explicit do a TRANSLATE make sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/171229756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/171241798","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/258#issuecomment-171241798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/258","id":171241798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTI0MTc5OA==","user":{"login":"mashengchen","id":3610829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTA4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3610829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen","html_url":"https://github.com/mashengchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mashengchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T10:14:21Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T10:14:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"jenkins,

Here is what I would suggest: Look at method FileScan::codeGenForHive() in file core/sql/generator/GenRelScan.cpp. This method builds two lists of CAST expressions, one for columns needed in predicates and one for columns needed only in the select lists. It makes CAST nodes by calling HbaseAccess::createAsciiColAndCastExpr(). By the way \"ASCII\" in this name is not quite correct. This produces an expression cast(NATypeToItem()). The NATypeToItem() represents the Hive column and this is the only place where we would support GBK for now (plus an equivalent place for inserts). If we wanted to translate a value, we would need to assign character set HIVE_FILE_CHARSET to \"asciiType\" in this method and produce cast(translate(NATypeToItem())) in this method. This would be needed only if a) this is for a Hive table, b) HIVE_FILE_CHARSET is non-empty (i.e. GBK) and not equal to HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET. For inserts, you would need to do something similar or disable inserts into GBK tables for now. You could add an optimization to skip the translate for numeric, datetime and interval columns that consist of ASCII characters only, if the translation leaves ASCII unchanged.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/171366398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/171366751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/257#issuecomment-171366751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/257","id":171366751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTM2Njc1MQ==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-13T17:10:17Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T17:10:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"About the missing regression test that Suresh mentioned: Not having a test makes it harder to review the code, since the change is not complete.
