We are tracing and monitoring a lot of systems, we can't break them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/481704017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/481727376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/2386#issuecomment-481727376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2386","id":481727376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTcyNzM3Ng==","user":{"login":"SkyWalkingRobot","id":35362890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzYyODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35362890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyWalkingRobot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyWalkingRobot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T14:59:38Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T14:59:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Here is the [test report](http://github.com/SkywalkingTest/agent-integration-test-report/tree/master/2019/4/bfergerson/testReport-master-2019-04-10-22-42.md) and [validate logs](http://35.227.88.23:49001/job/skywalking-agent-automated-testing/418/artifact/skywalking-agent-testcases/workspace/logs/validate-2019-04-10-22-42.log)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/481727376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/481902075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/2341#issuecomment-481902075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/2341","id":481902075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTkwMjA3NQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T23:15:40Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T23:15:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@wu-sheng you can try to ignore the opentracing thing and look at the other one in vert.x 4.
