I haven't had time to look at that in depth.  Unfortunately the configs and things have become a bit of a mess due to everything changing to spark-submit and changed to use sparkConf all at once. \nI think at one point not all the configs were being set in SparkConf and some were still just system properties and some of those were set after the SparkConf creation. I think that maybe why that was done that way.  But I need to look at it in depth more.\n\nI don't really see how that fixes this issue though.  That may forward the configs on but in yarn-cluster mode it doesn't do anything with the spark.yarn.dist.\\* configs without witgo's change.  ie it doesn't populate archives or files in anyway even though the configs are there.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46037439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46037683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/776#issuecomment-46037683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/776","id":46037683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDM3Njgz","user":{"login":"kanzhang","id":940009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/940009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/kanzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kanzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-13T17:25:46Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T17:25:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mateiz could you take another look at this when you get a chance?

I'm also adding a custom jar to the classpath using `--jars`.\n\nThe job runs and succeeds (it depends on a class in the kite jar I referenced in the command line), and when I look at the local directory for the Yarn container I see this there:\n\n```\n/yarn/nm/usercache/vanzin/appcache/application_1402520894306_0014/container_1402520894306_0014_01_000003/wordcount.tgz\n/yarn/nm/usercache/vanzin/appcache/application_1402520894306_0014/container_1402520894306_0014_01_000003/log4j.properties\n```\n\n(Among others.) The log file I set up in log4j.properties is also used by the process, so it's correctly uploading my local file.\n\nSo @witgo, can you explain more clearly what is it that is not working, and which case is not handled by my patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46051206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46051396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/997#issuecomment-46051396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/997","id":46051396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDUxMzk2","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-13T19:34:39Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T19:34:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We should document SPARK_CONF_DIR in the configuration guide.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46051396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46051547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/969#issuecomment-46051547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/969","id":46051547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDUxNTQ3","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-13T19:36:06Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T19:36:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vanzin its not an issue when using the sparkSubmit options (--archives/--files).

Thanks for taking a look at this! \n\nFirst of all let me just say that I ran Xiangrui's code but with \".fill(1000)\" (so 100x in RDD size), and it was still able to select a sample with exactly one data point in one pass. \n\nSo there's a couple things in play here. The smallest resolution handled by a Double is 2^(-1074) ~ 5e-324, so before we run into RDDs of size ~10^323, we in theory won't run into have a sampling rate of 0. Then it comes down to whether the random number generator is truly random and isn't biased against very small numbers. The two experiments Xiangrui and I ran seem to suggest that the java.util.Random object is able to produce small enough random numbers. However, we should definitely further investigate the quality of the RNG used to gauge sampling behavior at even smaller sampling rates. \n\nOne thing to note about this implementation is that at higher sampling rates, we are actually able to save memory by not caching as many samples as before in order to be able to guarantee the sample size in one try.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46059095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/46061313","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1055#issuecomment-46061313","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1055","id":46061313,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDYxMzEz","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-13T21:22:05Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T21:22:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"
