This could happen from LOG(FATAL) in any invoked function as well. I think we should by convention not allow marking destructors as `DMLC_THROW_EXCEPTION` because of this behavior. It's implicit and hard to catch in a code review, and it means error reports take longer to root cause.\r\n\r\nThe specific problem is that we are trying to set a string attribute value using a TVMObjectHandle. But, you can't see that because the destructor throws and we don't support chained exceptions. \r\n\r\nI see the benefits of writing the overall attrs mechanism this way, but it seems like the main use cases for using exceptions in the destructor are in invoking other visitors and in the AttrInitEntry object. In the AttrInitEntry object, we could just move the destructor logic to a Validate() function.

@ishitatsuyuki .\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to flesh out the queue priority further, since on certain desktops (e.g. Nvidia) having a high queue priority works fine. It would be great to confirm the impact of different queue priority on the performance, and whether we should set something between `0` and `1`. Ideally, we want good amount of compute without starving graphics.\r\n\r\nI would recommend do some experiment of values between `0` and `1`, we can further enable making the TVM_VK_QUEUE_PRIORITY as an env variable to adjust the value.

I would encourage us to do a bit more experiments, and enable ```TVM_VK_QUEUE_PRIORITY``` as a part of env variable, but keep the default in 1.0 for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/706712868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/706713069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6662#issuecomment-706713069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6662","id":706713069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjcxMzA2OQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-11T14:29:48Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T14:29:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkQueueGlobalPriorityEXT.html might be more relevant, since our main goal is to set the queue priority to be the same as the system default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/706713069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/706717465","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6662#issuecomment-706717465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6662","id":706717465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjcxNzQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"ishitatsuyuki","id":12389383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki","html_url":"https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishitatsuyuki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-11T14:59:12Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T14:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After a bit of research it seems that no implementation in Mesa actually respects pQueuePriorities; therefore I have reverted that part of the change.

It's the `apps/bundle_deploy/build_model.py` script which is segfaulting. I ran it using gdb inside the container.\r\n\r\nFrom `gdb -ex r --args python3 build_model.py -o build --test`.\r\n```\r\nThread 1 \"python3\" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\r\n__GI___libc_free (mem=0x6) at malloc.c:2958\r\n2958    malloc.c: No such file or directory.\r\n(gdb) bt\r\n#0  __GI___libc_free (mem=0x6) at malloc.c:2958\r\n#1  0x00007fffde4937f4 in dmlc::parameter::FieldAccessEntry::~FieldAccessEntry() () from /workspace/build/libtvm.so\r\n#2  0x00007fff9702a4af in dmlc::parameter::FieldEntry<std::string>::~FieldEntry() () from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/xgboost/./lib/libxgboost.so\r\n#3  0x00007fff97037267 in dmlc::parameter::ParamManager::~ParamManager() () from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/xgboost/./lib/libxgboost.so\r\n#4  0x00007ffff6cd7008 in __run_exit_handlers (status=0, listp=0x7ffff70615f8 <__exit_funcs>, run_list_atexit=run_list_atexit@entry=true) at exit.c:82\r\n#5  0x00007ffff6cd7055 in __GI_exit (status=<optimized out>) at exit.c:104\r\n#6  0x00007ffff6cbd847 in __libc_start_main (main=0x4d1cb0 <main>, argc=5, argv=0x7fffffffe858, init=<optimized out>, fini=<optimized out>, rtld_fini=<optimized out>, stack_end=0x7fffffffe848) at ../csu/libc-start.c:325\r\n#7  0x00000000005e8569 in _start ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that the issue is caused by the xgboost version in the CI docker is too old and has an incompatible dmlc-core commit. The container had xgboost 1.0.2. I upgraded to 1.2 and now the segfault is fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/707363920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/707366512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6641#issuecomment-707366512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6641","id":707366512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzM2NjUxMg==","user":{"login":"codeislife99","id":17168743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY4NzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17168743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99","html_url":"https://github.com/codeislife99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeislife99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T21:58:22Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T21:58:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@comaniac I addressed your comments.
