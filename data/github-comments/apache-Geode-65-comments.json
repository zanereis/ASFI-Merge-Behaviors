Do you have any idea how to restart that or what could be wrong?\r\n\r\nIf you click on the \"details\" link next to the failed job, it will open [the Concourse page](https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/65859) for the job, which has a section called \"execute_tests-openjdk8\" which will be red for a failed run. Expanding this section allows you to find the test that failed (the section can be large, so searching for \"failed\" saves having to scroll past lots of unimportant gradle output), which in this case is [ShutdownAllDUnitTest.testShutdownAllWithMembersWaiting()](https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/builds/65859#L60e863bb:583).\r\n\r\nSearching the GEODE JIRA for this test name shows that [we have an existing ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-9038) for this failure. Unfortunately there are a lot of known flaky tests in Geode, particularly in the distributed-test jobs, so it's not uncommon to hit them in pre-checkin.\r\n\r\nThe good news, though, is that it is not mandatory for all pre-checkin jobs to be passing in order to merge a PR, only the ones marked \"required\" on GitHub, so a PR with an unrelated flaky failure in one of the non-required jobs can still be merged. However, if you want to re-trigger the job for the sake of getting a fully green pre-checkin, you can always push an empty commit which will cause the job to run again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/901256129/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/901278913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6756#issuecomment-901278913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6756","id":901278913,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV841uGzB","user":{"login":"gesterzhou","id":10713950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzEzOTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10713950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/gesterzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-18T17:03:17Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T17:03:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> This is a good change.

I would suggest also adding a test to the `AuthExpirationMultiServerDUnitTest`, and test those `onRegion`, `onServer` and `onServers` calls and verify behavior is as expected.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can make that work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/904891259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/904907879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6757#issuecomment-904907879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6757","id":904907879,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV84178xn","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-24T19:16:48Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T19:16:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @DonalEvans thank you so much.

I love the change to SanctionedSerializablesService. A lot cleaner!\r\n> \r\n> In the future, it would better not to bundle these unrelated changes together. The RestRegionAPIIntegrationTest and QueryCommandDUnitTestBase stuff really doesn't have anything to do with serialization service changes and shouldn't be in here.\r\n> \r\n> Edit: approved the changed - what I thought was a problem is in test code, not product.\r\n\r\n@upthewaterspout QueryCommandDUnitTestBase is actually one of the few (maybe only) DUnit tests that directly exercises the serialization filter in Geode with an expected failure. I only touched it because its subclasses started failing when I added sanctioned serializables support to geode-dunit.\r\n\r\nRestRegionAPIIntegrationTest does not have anything to do with the serialization filter, however it broke because of changes I made to geode-web-api's build.gradle file. After making changes to it for debugging and understanding what it was doing, I decided to include it since it was part of the \"work\" I had to do rather than jump through hoops to move it to a different branch.\r\n\r\nSo, QueryCommandDUnitTestBase is actually part of the changes for serialization filtering.

I mean user should be able to configure it using member-timeout or  if you want to provide any other config. The issue is in big network , some components might take more time(more than 12437ms) to reconnect to cluster during membership change. Since this  is set to a small value 12437ms so those members get thrown out of cluster. I looked into the code change and doc change, and I see the upper limit is still there. This won't solve the problem for which this jira was raised.\r\n       Can you please take a relook into this issue.\r\nThanks\r\nAmit","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/912228207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/912673776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6803#issuecomment-912673776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6803","id":912673776,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV842Zkvw","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T16:48:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T16:48:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Force pushing after rebasing on develop to resolve merge conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/912673776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/912678118","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6814#issuecomment-912678118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6814","id":912678118,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhObV842Zlzm","user":{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T16:56:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T16:56:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kirklund, thanks for the review.
