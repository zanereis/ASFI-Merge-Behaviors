Any particular reason for adding this API ?\r\n\r\n@desaikomal For upcoming functionality where multiple actors can put cluster into maintenance mode for different reasons. Example, if cluster is maintenance mode for reason_A, reason_B, and reason_C, the cluster will not fully exit and delete the node until all reasons have been removed. ZKHelixAdmin will have API to update the cluster maintenance signal and it will also delete the znode if there are no more reasons left in it. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a possible race condition where a reason was added after the client retrieves the znode information but before delete is called. This can be avoided by requiring the znode versions to match when we delete.

@MarkGaox @xyuanlu \r\nThanks for reviews. Unfortunately commit history got messed up and had to force push to fastforward. I addressed comments in the most recent commit  ([\"remove with expected version no longer recursively deletes\"](https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2759/commits/8b9b5d09e5ee412eed53653e1c7f14d0efdbe312))\r\n\r\nImportant change is that I've decoupled remove and \"remove with expected version\" in the BaseDataAcessor. Original remove method attempts to recursively delete if the in initial delete fails. The new \"remove with expected version\" method should not have this recursive delete behavior as it can lead to race condition between initial delete and call to recursive delete. It will now fail if the property is not a leaf node. \r\nShould I now rename remove with expected version to a separate method entirely or stay with the method overloading? The difference in recursive behavior may not be immediately clear to customers.
