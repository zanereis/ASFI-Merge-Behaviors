And the plug-in provides matching files. Through the configuration file, you can control the log source (log4j2, logbak, log4j), package name, level, and content that need to be stored in the span log, and you can customize the log format saved to the span log. .\r\n\r\n# Configuration file\r\n\r\n`logfilter.yaml`\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  - name: \"log4j2\"\r\n    packages:\r\n      - package1\r\n      - package2\r\n    level: \"trace\"\r\n    pattern: \"%date %level [%thread] %logger{10} [%file:%line] %msg%n\"\r\n    expression: \"Regular expression\"\r\n  - name: \"logbak\"\r\n    packages:\r\n      - package3\r\n    level: \"error\"\r\n    pattern: \"%msg%n\"\r\n    expression: \"Regular expression\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Field description\r\n\r\n**name attribute**: Specify the log system that needs to perform log conversion. If you use a configuration file for configuration, the name must be written.\r\n\r\nThere are four values for name:\r\n\r\n* log4j\r\n* log4j2\r\n* logbak\r\n* `*`:Match all supported log\r\n\r\n**package attribute**: Specify the package name of the log that needs log conversion. When using the configuration file for configuration, it can be defaulted. If the default is stupid with `*`, it will match all packages.\r\n\r\n`package value`:\r\n\r\n* the name of package, eg: `org.apache.skywalking`\r\n* `*`:match all \r\n\r\n**level attribute**: The level of the log for conversion. **By default it is `error` level**\r\n\r\n* trace\r\n* debug\r\n* info\r\n* error\r\n\r\n**pattern attribute:** used to control the format of the log written to the span log\r\n\r\nThe control method of the specific format, refer to logbak, for details, please refer to http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html\r\n\r\n**expression attribute**: filter logs that need to be converted into lspan log. This attribute accepts a regular expression, the content of the log body will be matched, if it is matched, then input, otherwise no conversion will be performed. **By default, it matches all, that is, no filtering is performed. **\r\n\r\n# Realization idea\r\n\r\n1. Analyze the configuration file and fill it into a  instance of `loggerConfig`, which contains a List to store Logger, which is a record of configuration information of the logging system.\r\n\r\n2. After the error method is intercepted, the log level will be determined according to the configuration file. **If the level requirements are met**, the regular expression filtering will begin. If the filtering requirements are met, the instance of `LogEvent` will be created. After filling, execute the formate method to format the log information.\r\n\r\n   **Formatting operation method (modeled on PatternLayout to realize log analysis):**\r\n\r\n   1. The `LoggerFactory.getLogger()` method is enhanced to obtain the logger object. And then get the  object of `LoggerContext` .\r\n\r\n      ```java\r\n      Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CaseController.class);\r\n              ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger myLogger = (ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger) logger;\r\n              LoggerContext context = myLogger.getLoggerContext();\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   2. Rewrite a suitable Appender or use `PatternLayoutEncorder` directly to format the required information\r\n\r\n      ```java\r\n       Logger rootLogger = (Logger)LoggerFactory.getLogger(Logger.ROOT_LOGGER_NAME);\r\n          LoggerContext loggerContext = rootLogger.getLoggerContext();\r\n          // we are not interested in auto-configuration\r\n          loggerContext.reset();\r\n      \r\n          PatternLayoutEncoder encoder = new PatternLayoutEncoder();\r\n          encoder.setContext(loggerContext);\r\n          encoder.setPattern(\"%-5level [%thread]: %message%n\");\r\n          encoder.start();\r\n      \r\n          ConsoleAppender<ILoggingEvent> appender = new ConsoleAppender<ILoggingEvent>();\r\n          appender.setContext(loggerContext);\r\n          appender.setEncoder(encoder); \r\n          appender.start();\r\n      \r\n          rootLogger.addAppender(appender);\r\n      \r\n          rootLogger.debug(\"Message 1\");\r\n          rootLogger.warn(\"Message 2\");\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n3.

It is very helpful.\r\n\r\nI've taken a look at the work you've done and it does seem to be pretty much there for Logback. Btw, you have `logbak` written in multiple places and I think you meant `logback`. I can submit this fix and a few other code cleaning refactors if you like.\r\n\r\nI have some questions which would be helpful for me to contribute to this task:\r\n- Why does `LogbakLoggerFactoryInstrumentation` need to know about `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`?\r\n   - I would assume slf4j wouldn't come into the picture as under the hood it is using other logging frameworks. As long as those logging frameworks are supported I don't see why there would need to be any code related to slf4j.\r\n- How did you plan on testing all of these logging frameworks?\r\n  - The test class you've created depends on spring-boot-starter-web which defaults to logback. Did you plan on testting all logging frameworks under this one scenario or did you plan on testing one logging framework per scenario? If so maybe `logger-scenario` is too broad as is.\r\n- Why save `LoggerContext` to a thread local map instead of pulling it from `objInst`?\r\n- What's the need for starting and stopping a span for adding logging?\r\n   - Couldn't you just do `if (ContextManager.isActive()) ContextManager.activeSpan().log(...)`\r\n - What format did you have in mind for logging to spans?\r\n   - `AbstractSpan` only has `log(Throwable)` and `log(long, Map<String, ?>)`. What type of map would you put there? Just a single key/value map with a key of `data` and the log saved to value?\r\n\r\nApologies if that's a lot of questions. I'm just trying to get on the same page as you so I can help more effectively.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/729843248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/730071769","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5860#issuecomment-730071769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5860","id":730071769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDA3MTc2OQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T01:48:08Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T01:48:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"v3 should have been activated in the Istio 1.7 and 1.8 already.

Basically, I'm thinking this:\r\n```java\r\nval pattern = null //todo: parse and format log message based on the configured pattern from logfilter.yaml\r\nval level = null //todo: determine log level being logged\r\n\r\nif (ContextManager.isActive()) {\r\n    Map<String, String> logMap = new HashMap<>();\r\n    logMap.put(\"event\", level);\r\n    logMap.put(\"message\", pattern);\r\n    if (level == \"error\") {\r\n        logMap.put(\"error.kind\", null); //todo: determine error kind\r\n        logMap.put(\"stack\", null); //todo: determine stack trace\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ContextManager.activeSpan().log(System.currentTimeMillis(), logMap);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough again, my only question would be whether or not the stack trace was always included regardless of log level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/730400383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/730431146","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5863#issuecomment-730431146","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5863","id":730431146,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDQzMTE0Ng==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T14:59:05Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T14:59:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, my understanding is `pattern` is the `message` in the log.

Also, I don't think there would be a need for a new line in the pattern as these logs are not going directly to the console.\r\n\r\nI'm also having second thoughts about adding the file and line number to the pattern. I forgot these incur a [performance cost](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#LocationInformation). I still would like to be able to correlate this information but again I'm not completely sure my needs represent what most people's needs are. Either way, I'm starting to think that an appropriate solution for me would be to simply store the log pattern and the parameters separately. Given that the logger plugin hooks into `trace/debug/info/error` method calls, it actually has access to both the pattern and the parameters. If I knew what the unformatted pattern was I can essentially do a grep to find the location (even using the logger name to limit the search even further).\r\n\r\nThere are some advantages to structured logs over unstructured logs. For example, given this log:\r\n```java\r\nlog.warn(\"span {} has illegal status code {}\", span, tag.getValue());\r\n```\r\n\r\nStoring this as unstructured would be saving the following map to a span:\r\n```json\r\n\"logs\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"time\": 1605225365711,\r\n    \"data\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"event\",\r\n        \"value\": \"warn\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"log.kind\",\r\n        \"value\": \"org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.analyzer.provider.trace.parser.listener.MultiScopesAnalysisListener\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"message\",\r\n        \"value\": \"span *span* has illegal status code *tag.getValue()*\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I'm unsure if SkyWalking plans on making the logs queryable but if I wanted to find all the logs where the `tag.getValue()` had a certain value, that would mean doing regex over the `message` variable. Alternatively, you could store both the pattern and the params, like so:\r\n```json\r\n\"logs\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"time\": 1605225365711,\r\n    \"data\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"event\",\r\n        \"value\": \"warn\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"log.kind\",\r\n        \"value\": \"org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.analyzer.provider.trace.parser.listener.MultiScopesAnalysisListener\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"message\",\r\n        \"value\": \"span {} has illegal status code {}\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"param.1\",\r\n        \"value\": \"*span*\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"param.2\",\r\n        \"value\": \"*tag.getValue()*\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think storing logs this way could provide some benefits when it comes to making them queryable. It would also solve my desire to be able to correlate the source code location of the data being logged as now I can simply grep by the message. There could also be benefits to RocketBot/CLI visualization as the user could then reformat logs on the client-side as they see fit and the structure of the logs wouldn't need to be processed on-the-fly by the SkyWalking agent (so maybe that'll help with processing time).\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think. As always, I'm fine simply creating a PR later on to add extra configuration to suit my needs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/731602931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/731679984","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5863#issuecomment-731679984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5863","id":731679984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTY3OTk4NA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-22T02:48:41Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T02:48:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Now I'm unsure if SkyWalking plans on making the logs queryable\r\n\r\nRight now, tag-based query is providing limited and pre-defined scopes, as the performance impact.\r\n\r\n> I don't think there would be a need for a new line in the pattern as these logs are not going directly to the console.\r\n\r\nI have a similar feeling, but the most interesting thing is `threadId`, which is not required by the SkyWalking currently but may be needed by the users.
