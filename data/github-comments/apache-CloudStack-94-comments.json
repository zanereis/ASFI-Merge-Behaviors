When more details are necessary, we change the code to send a map or some other structure, I personally do not like using maps to move data around, I prefer simple and descriptive POJOs.\n\nAdditionally, the task to move getters and setters to an upper class is not easily achievable. I thought about that a while, and after inspecting the command classes that would have to be changed, I decided to mark that as a future work; of course, if you have an easy, nice and neat solution, you are welcome to share. @nvazquez had around worked around a lot of problems and had written a pretty nice, well documented and tested code.\n\n@nvazquez, after all emails and messages exchanged, I can give an LGTM to this PR. Great job man ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/181819761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/181824159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1407#issuecomment-181824159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1407","id":181824159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTgyNDE1OQ==","user":{"login":"ntavares","id":961938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTkzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/961938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares","html_url":"https://github.com/ntavares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntavares/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T11:24:21Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T11:24:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I also spotted what could be an error in the messages DB:\n\nlabel.snapshot.s=Snapshots\nlabel.snapshots=Snapshots\n\nLooks like a typo to me, maybe you want to merge those two - I don't know where to do it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/181824159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/181870469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1407#issuecomment-181870469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1407","id":181870469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTg3MDQ2OQ==","user":{"login":"milamberspace","id":3995882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTU4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3995882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace","html_url":"https://github.com/milamberspace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milamberspace/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T13:47:56Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T13:47:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Tested on 4.8 snapshot branch.
