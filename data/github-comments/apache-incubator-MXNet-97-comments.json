I trace the shapes in the script provided, and they are consistent with what I originally posted:\n1. FC layer will have shape `(10, 200000)`, not `(128, 10)`.\n2. Embedding layer has shape `(200000, 10)`, moreover it asserts in the `embedding-imp.h`  that the weight tensor is two dimensional :)\n\nBut I agree that my example overall is wrong, since the input shape for the embedding layer should be one-dimensional. When I fix it by changing this line:\n\n`arg_shape, out_shape, aux_shape = f.infer_shape(inp = (128, in_dim))`\n\nwith\n\n`arg_shape, out_shape, aux_shape = f.infer_shape(inp = (128,) if test_embeddings else (128, in_dim))`\n\nIt stops exploding memory, so I guess it is somehow specific to providing 2d input to the Embedding tensor. I would still consider the original issue posted as worth investigating (it is not obvious why should memory double if the input to the Embedding layer is two dimensional), but since it works properly for the 1d input, which is the intended use case, I guess my original suspicion that Embedding layers do not share weights is incorrect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236370561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236371070","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2877#issuecomment-236371070","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2877","id":236371070,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjM3MTA3MA==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-30T15:24:39Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T15:24:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@SkidanovAlex Embedding layer supports 2D input.

Since the output tensor is much larger than the embedding weight whose shape is (200000, 10), it will dominate the memory consumption.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236372726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236373966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2874#issuecomment-236373966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2874","id":236373966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjM3Mzk2Ng==","user":{"login":"liumilan","id":5533901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzM5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5533901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan","html_url":"https://github.com/liumilan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liumilan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-30T16:14:43Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T16:14:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"what u mean?\nAs I said, the much more data loaded,it cost much more time to save\n@starimpact \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236373966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236381466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1844#issuecomment-236381466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1844","id":236381466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjM4MTQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-30T18:29:14Z","updated_at":"2016-07-30T18:29:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For anyone else coming across this.

Assume we want to predict the next k words, i.e, x_{t+1:t+k}. The estimator can be $\\arg\\max_{x_{t+1:t+k}} p(x_{t+1:t+k}) \\mid \\hat{x}_{1:t})$.  The problem is how to solve this optimization problem based on our model for one-step prediction, which is given by the RNN. One observation is that for every specific $x_{t+1:t+k}$, we can easily compute its probability. However, it would be impossible for us to enumerate all the combinations and we need to find some approximate solutions. There are two possible ways for that, Beam Search (deterministic) and Sequential Monte-Carlo (probabilistic). For beam search, the idea is to always keep the word trajectories that have the highest likelihood. For sequential monte-carlo, the idea is to give a particle approximation of the distribution and update these particles.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236486425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236489186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2751#issuecomment-236489186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2751","id":236489186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjQ4OTE4Ng==","user":{"login":"jonbakerfish","id":2463872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjM4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2463872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish","html_url":"https://github.com/jonbakerfish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonbakerfish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T04:53:11Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T04:53:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm using the latest mxnet repo.

seems if the network has more complex structures, it becomes not that stable. Here I use the residual structure from \"example\" folder. I changed number of filters for each group to increase the capcity of the network. and I also remove the alst fc and pooling layer to allow different input shapes. If I bind the network with say data = (1, 3, 1000, 1000), the memory usage is around 1533MB when the input size is fixed. If I bind the network with this maximum input size and reshape it using different smaller sizes, I will get out of memory soon. I have only 4GB gpu memory.
