a few quick tests and can confirm that as long the hint is not activated by the user, NB behaves pretty much like it used to.\r\n\r\nhowever my first \"load test\" already broke it when I added a java file to my home folder and activated the hint. NB scanned for a few minutes till it ran out of memory (default dev build seems to use 8GB max on my system with 32GB) and I was not able to cancel the scanning anymore at this point so i had to kill the process.\r\n\r\nI get the feeling that it will be fairly difficult to find a satisfying solution since the location of the java file will fairly often not be the equivalent of a src/ folder. I essentially can't put a java file anywhere near my NetBeansProjects folder ;)\r\n\r\nWe don't have to rush anything now of course, we can disable the feature for a release in NB until we figure something out.\r\nSomething i would also like to see is a JDK selector in the file properties - this would coincidentally also fit very well to a srcpath/classpath field which is likely the more realistic approach compared to letting NB scan everything it sees relative to the java file.\r\n\r\nedit as a side note:\r\nthe user will have to set the classpath anyway when the program runs in most cases. I just wrote a JDK 22 script for https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6927 and I have to run it with:\r\n```\r\njava --enable-preview --source 22 -cp \"lib/*\" .github/scripts/BinariesListUpdates.java ./\r\n```\r\n\r\nedit2:\r\nmore thoughts:\r\n - the hint could be only active on `cannot find symbol` errors and then scan the java file imports and add the paths to the search path file property. This would follow the vague rules of the JEP section \"How the launcher finds source files.\" This would be the initial value for the file's sourcepath property which can be still customized later by the user.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1882427808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1882563581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6797#issuecomment-1882563581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6797","id":1882563581,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5wNaP9","user":{"login":"rothardo","id":83207402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjA3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83207402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo","html_url":"https://github.com/rothardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T07:52:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T07:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbien I have completed the necessary changes as adviced","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1882563581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1882824095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6912#issuecomment-1882824095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6912","id":1882824095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5wOZ2f","user":{"login":"lahodaj","id":51319204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzE5MjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51319204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj","html_url":"https://github.com/lahodaj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lahodaj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T10:38:43Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T10:38:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So, regarding the indexing when the root (home directory) is registered - is there a reason to believe that's significantly different from when one makes the home directory a source root in a J2SE project? The multi-file handling is not really changing the way things are indexed, it just registers directories for indexing, as does J2SE project. (There's a bit of a difference due to the exclusions, which may load other projects, but that hopefully should not have that big impact.)\r\n\r\nI am afraid I don't get the part related to srcpath. If there's a Java file without a package clause in the home directory, what else could be on the srcpath than the home directory? Individual files cannot be on a source path (and, inside NB, all entries in a path must be directories, that applies also to classpath, etc.) We'd need to *exclude* from the sourcepath, not add to it.

I think this is the right decision and gives us more time to think about solutions - and also gain more experience with usecases of the JEP 458 itself in the meantime.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, as long as the behavior inside NB is acceptable (i.e. based on the feedback here, the same as in NB 20), I don't think I'll be looking too much into improving the capabilities there. Feel free to look into that, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1883865978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1884200291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6934#issuecomment-1884200291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6934","id":1884200291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5wTp1j","user":{"login":"brutzman","id":7712992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTI5OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7712992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman","html_url":"https://github.com/brutzman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brutzman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-10T05:08:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T05:08:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Acknowledged with thanks, we'll think about when we can pursue that direction.\r\n\r\nSuggest considering changes to NetBeans \"_Package as_\" menu actions so that developers are alerted to issues when trying them.
