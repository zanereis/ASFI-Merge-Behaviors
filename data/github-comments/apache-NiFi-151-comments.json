Providing some additional documentation would be helpful, although I think it would be better to wait until other components start leveraging this module.  I attempted to provide some high-level abstractions in the `EventSender` and `EventServer` interfaces, but even these interfaces and implementations are geared sending and receiving byte arrays for Syslog messages.  There should be some reuse of these classes for other processors, such as `PutTCP` and `ListenTCP`, among others.  If there are particular components that could use some additional description, feel free to point those out.  However, I expect some changes when it comes to leveraging similar approaches with other components.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any additional comments or questions!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/830687467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/830713092","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3343#issuecomment-830713092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3343","id":830713092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMDcxMzA5Mg==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-02T00:11:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-02T00:11:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We're marking this PR as stale due to lack of updates in the past few months.

I'm using the term \"Vault\" as implementation-specific shorthand for HashiCorp Vault (similar to Spring, which calls their HashiCorp Vault service simply \"Spring Vault\").  I understand there are other similar technologies with similar names, like Azure Key Vault, so that could be a point of confusion.  My thought here was to provide a HashiCorp Vault-specific integration point, which can be used in multiple places (Sensitive Properties Providers, Controller Services/Processors, and even ParameterContext providers in the future).  If we end up needing an overarching term for generic \"vaults\", I suggest we use a different term.  However, I think the core framework and API already provides this level of abstraction by giving us terms like \"Sensitive Properties Provider\" (for which there can be a HashiCorp Vault implementation, an Azure Key Vault implementation, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn my mind, the VaultCommunicationService, VaultProperties, etc. are actually fairly specific to HashiCorp Vault, and rather than pushing them into a more generic API, I think we should rely on the already existing APIs like SensitivePropertiesProvider to serve as the extension point for future implementations.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about renaming all of these to HashiCorpVault* to help reduce the confusion?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/831612138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/831655216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5012#issuecomment-831655216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5012","id":831655216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTY1NTIxNg==","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-04T02:56:30Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T02:56:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@s9514171 Thank you for the contribution.
