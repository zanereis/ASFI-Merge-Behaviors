Can you also add a test class in `TestInputFormat` and test the input splits logic for streaming read in this case ?\r\n> \r\n> You can take a reference from `TestInputFormat#testReadSkipCompaction`\r\n\r\nApologies for the late reply, given that the read behaviour is correct, the only way we can test this fix is to make the `IncrementalInputSplits#getInstantRange` method public.\r\n\r\nThis bug is caused by `IncrementalInputSplits#getInstantRange` not producing the correct result, causing unnecessary file checks, blocking the first read cycle. \r\n\r\nThe `IncrementalInputSplits.inputSplits` method is still able to produce the right result, allowing the right records to be read out. \r\n\r\nHence, I believe a test should be performed on the generation of `HoodieInstants` to read via the `IncrementalInputSplits#getInstantRange` method instead of the read behaviour like the rest of the tests in the `TestInputFormat` class are doing.\r\n\r\nTo do this, one will have to make the method public or use Reflection to access this class, I am not sure if loading the class in via reflection is the right way to approach this test.\r\n\r\nDo you have any
