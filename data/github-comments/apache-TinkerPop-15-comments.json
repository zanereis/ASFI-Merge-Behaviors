I think we should go with @robertdale proposal of int32, int64, Vertex, uuid, etc. instead of Java class names.\n2. In Java we then have a `Map<String,Class>` for typecasting accordingly.\n3.

believe there is an easier solution. However, you don't provide a test case so I don't know if it works. \n\nCHANGE:\n\n```\n@Override\n        public Edge addEdge(final String label, final Vertex inVertex, final Object... keyValues) {\n            final Edge edge = this.addOutEdge(label, inVertex, keyValues);\n            if (inVertex.equals(this)) {\n                if(null == this.inEdges)\n                    this.inEdges = new HashMap<>();\n                List<Edge> inE = this.inEdges.get(label);\n                if (null == inE) {\n                    inE = new ArrayList<>();\n                    this.inEdges.put(label, inE);\n                }\n                inE.add(edge);\n            }\n            return edge;\n        }\n```\n\nTO\n\n```\n @Override\n        public Edge addEdge(final String label, final Vertex inVertex, final Object... keyValues) {\n            final Edge edge = this.addOutEdge(label, inVertex, keyValues);\n            if (inVertex.equals(this)) {\n                if (ElementHelper.getIdValue(keyValues).isPresent())\n                    this.addInEdge(label, this, keyValues);\n                else {\n                    final Object[] keyValuesWithId = Arrays.copyOf(keyValues,keyValues.length+2);\n                    keyValuesWithId[keyValuesWithId.length - 2] = T.id;\n                    keyValuesWithId[keyValuesWithId.length - 1] = edge.id();\n                    this.addInEdge(label, this, keyValuesWithId);\n                }\n            }\n            return edge;\n        }\n```\n\nNote that when I do this, all the current tests in TinkerPop pass (`StarGraphTest`). Moreover, I added a test case to `StarGraphTest` that uses a `GraphFilter`. I hope it tests what you want it to (when I didn't change the method, the test still passes :| -- thus, you may need to add a test to ensure we get failure without the new method addEdge method).\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/TINKERPOP-1397\n\nFinally, I think that you might think that bothE() would only return the edge once, it shouldn't. It should return it twice. If that is the misunderstanding, then this is NOT an issue.\n\n```\ngremlin> g.V(0l).bothE()\n==>e[1][0-self->0]\n==>e[1][0-self->0]\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/237613717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/237644644","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/366#issuecomment-237644644","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/366","id":237644644,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzY0NDY0NA==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T18:40:22Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T18:40:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Test case `g.V().repeat(__.in().out()).times(3).tail(7).count()` against the modern graph returns `-62`.

The problem this PR tried to address was that, after applying an inE graph filter to a self-looped StarVertex, the StarVertex had two edges in its outEdges map and no edges in its inEdges map (should be one each).  I think this is not just some obscure internals problem, because I discovered it through a traversal.

pulled master (@ fc79de813c788ee141175bbf1ea6d0cdefa94a0f) and confirmed that the bug still existed.  I didn't apply your proposed change right away.  Here a `gremlin.sh` session that shows the buggy behavior.  I'm also pushing a unit test that I developed first, but it's easier to see what's going wrong in this `gremlin.sh` session than in the source code for a unit test.\n\n```\n$ `find gremlin-console/target -name gremlin.sh`\n\n         \\,,,/\n         (o o)\n-----oOOo-(3)-oOOo-----\nplugin activated: tinkerpop.server\nplugin activated: tinkerpop.utilities\nplugin activated: tinkerpop.tinkergraph\ngremlin> sg = org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.util.star.StarGraph.open()\n==>stargraph[starOf:null]\ngremlin> v = sg.addVertex('name', 'foo')\n==>v[0]\ngremlin> v.addEdge('self', v)\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().inE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().outE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().bothE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\n// NOTE: StarOutEdge in the inEdges datastructure\ngremlin> v.inEdges.values().iterator().next().get(0).getClass()\n==>class org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.util.star.StarGraph$StarOutEdge\ngremlin> filter = new org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.computer.GraphFilter()\n==>graphfilter[none]\ngremlin> filter.setEdgeFilter(__.bothE(\"self\"))\n==>null\ngremlin> sg.applyGraphFilter(filter)\n==>Optional[stargraph[starOf:v[0]]]\n// NOTE: no inE results, double outE results after GraphFilter is applied\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().inE('self')\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().outE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().bothE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin>\n```\n\nThere are a couple of things worth noting above:\n- the `inEdges` datastructure contains a `StarOutEdge` when we construct the graph this way\n- the final post-filtering `inE` and `outE` are incorrect (an indirect consequence of the first point)\n\nThese steps produce different behavior depending on whether I invoke `StarGraph.open()` or call `StarGraph.of(<some self-looped tinkervertex>)`.  If I do the latter, I get a `StarInEdge` in the `inEdges` map and a `StarOutEdge` in the `outEdges` map, and in turn avoid this particular filtering bug.\n\n**Good news**: your change makes sense and fixes the bug I initially reported (both-filtering).\n\n**Bad news**: I think there are more graph filtering bugs on StarGraph that can create half-edges\n\nWhen I filter a self-loop star graph for either in or out, I get stuff like this (symmetrical for `.inE`):\n\n```\ngremlin> filter = new org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.computer.GraphFilter()\n==>graphfilter[none]\ngremlin> filter.setEdgeFilter(__.outE(\"self\"))\n==>null\ngremlin> sg.applyGraphFilter(filter)\n==>Optional[stargraph[starOf:v[0]]]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V()\n==>v[0]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().inE('self')\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().outE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin> sg.traversal().V().bothE('self')\n==>e[2][0-self->0]\ngremlin>\n```\n\n@okram: This doesn't look correct, but then again, I don't really know what it should do.  Should it completely destroy the self-loop, so that inE/bothE/outE all fail to emit anything associated with the self-loop?  Should it transform the self-loop into a single-directional edge (which seems like one interpretation for what it does now, in which case it might be correct)?\n\nI noticed that the name of my original branch is nonsense (\"DSP-1397\").  I don't think that can be changed after a PR is created.  So, I'm opening a pair of new PRs: one for tp31 and one for master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/239040650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/239041633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/372#issuecomment-239041633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/372","id":239041633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTA0MTYzMw==","user":{"login":"dalaro","id":260045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro","html_url":"https://github.com/dalaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T00:05:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T00:05:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I opened two PRs, (one for tp31 as Stephen requested, and a new one for master):\n- #377 (master)\n- #378 (tp31)\n\nAs far as I can tell, GraphFilter did not exist in 3.1, and it may not even be possible to induce the buggy traversal behavior describe in #372 (which was all based on master / 3.2).

Why would anybody end up with dozens of `identity()`s?\n\nIMHO we should either:\n- deprecate the strategy and remove it completely in a later release or\n- remove it from the default strategies and only run performance tests for more than 5 chained `identity()`s\n\nI think I'd prefer the former as I really can't see any real use cases where this strategy would be advantageous.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241010479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241012314","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/384#issuecomment-241012314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/384","id":241012314,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTAxMjMxNA==","user":{"login":"robertdale","id":122206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale","html_url":"https://github.com/robertdale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertdale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T13:02:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T13:02:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Attached groovy script that prints the color palette.  usage: groovy jansi-colors.txt \n\n[jansi-colors.txt](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/files/427016/jansi-colors.txt)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241012314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241021219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/384#issuecomment-241021219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/384","id":241021219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTAyMTIxOQ==","user":{"login":"alaam","id":3844049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDQwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3844049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam","html_url":"https://github.com/alaam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alaam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T13:41:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T13:41:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/241021219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
