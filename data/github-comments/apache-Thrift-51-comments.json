For example for json logging:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvar pool = sync.Pool{\r\n  New: func() interface{} {\r\n    return thrift.NewTMemoryBuffer()\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc loggingMiddleware(name string, next thrift.TProcessorFunction) thrift.TProcessorFunction {\r\n  return thrift.WrappedTProcessorFunction{\r\n    Wrapped: func(ctx context.Context, seqID int32, in, out thrift.TProtocol) (_ bool, err thrift.TException) {\r\n      inBuf := pool.Get().(*thrift.TMemoryBuffer)\r\n      inBuf.Reset()\r\n      iproto := thrift.NewTSimpleJSONProtocol(inBuf)\r\n      // Since in thrift compiled Processor functions, we call ReadMessageBegin\r\n      // before calling the actual processor, we will have the ReadMessageEnd at\r\n      // the end without the pairing ReadMessageBegin call, and that will cause\r\n      // TSimpleJSONProtocol to panic.\r\n      iproto.WriteMessageBegin(ctx, \"\" /* name */, thrift.CALL, seqID)\r\n      in = TRecordingProtocol{\r\n        Actual:    in,\r\n        Recording: iproto,\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      outBuf := pool.Get().(*thrift.TMemoryBuffer)\r\n      outBuf.Reset()\r\n      oproto := thrift.NewTSimpleJSONProtocol(outBuf)\r\n      out = TRecordingProtocol{\r\n        Actual:    out,\r\n        Recording: oproto,\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      defer func() {\r\n        iproto.Flush(ctx)\r\n        logger(\"method\", name, \"request\", inBuf.String(), \"response\", outBuf.String(), \"err\", err)\r\n      }()\r\n\r\n      return next.Process(ctx, seqID, in, out)\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I can also use it to record the size on the wire (also I think this is inefficient and it's better done in envoy/etc.):\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc sizeRecordingMiddleware(name string, next thrift.TProcessorFunction) thrift.TProcessorFunction {\r\n  return thrift.WrappedTProcessorFunction{\r\n    Wrapped: func(ctx context.Context, seqID int32, in, out thrift.TProtocol) (bool, thrift.TException) {\r\n      inBuf := pool.Get().(*thrift.TMemoryBuffer)\r\n      inBuf.Reset()\r\n      outBuf := pool.Get().(*thrift.TMemoryBuffer)\r\n      outBuf.Reset()\r\n\r\n      defer func() {\r\n        requestSizeHistogram.Observe(inBuf.Len())\r\n        responseSizeHistogram.Observe(outBuf.Len())\r\n        pool.Put(inBuf)\r\n        pool.Put(outBuf)\r\n      }()\r\n\r\n      iproto := factory.GetProtocol(inBuf)\r\n      in = TRecordingProtocol{\r\n        Actual:    in,\r\n        Recording: iproto,\r\n      }\r\n      oproto := factory.GetProtocol(outBuf)\r\n      out = TRecordingProtocol{\r\n        Actual:    out,\r\n        Recording: oproto,\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return next.Process(ctx, seqID, in, out)\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf people find it useful I can totally just implement this `RecordingTProtocol` in thrift library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/705903922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/705970651","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1992#issuecomment-705970651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1992","id":705970651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTk3MDY1MQ==","user":{"login":"voodoo-dn","id":5621571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjE1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5621571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn","html_url":"https://github.com/voodoo-dn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-09T05:08:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T05:08:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Will

In my personal opinion json logging all requests and responses are very inefficient and not ok (I tried that `loggingMiddleware` in our staging, and because our requests and responses are so large our log ingester cannot handle those super large log entries). But it's as ok as your implementation of json marshal all requests and responses with interceptor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/706334453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/706340328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1992#issuecomment-706340328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1992","id":706340328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjM0MDMyOA==","user":{"login":"voodoo-dn","id":5621571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjE1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5621571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn","html_url":"https://github.com/voodoo-dn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/voodoo-dn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-09T18:34:39Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T18:34:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I meant that you have chosen approach, where information logging allowed only when you use TJsonProtocol, instead of interceptor, that can work with any protocol.\r\n\r\nBut I understand your position about code that grows in generator.\r\n\r\nI think that I haven't arguments and I think you can close MR.

The only thing which should affect the IO operations should be the IO timeout which should be configured inside the server or transport\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/722822196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/722879339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2181#issuecomment-722879339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2181","id":722879339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjg3OTMzOQ==","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T06:15:51Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T06:15:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zerosnake0 I replied some of your points below.

Personally I think 2.b will be more reasonable because we need to set timeout specifically every time the IO reads/writes the request/response\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that currently the only reason cancels the context is the disconnection, which will surely affect all your IO operations after.\r\n\r\nI will try to work something out and let you know","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/723393352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/723397818","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2181#issuecomment-723397818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2181","id":723397818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzM5NzgxOA==","user":{"login":"fishy","id":78183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-07T06:05:55Z","updated_at":"2020-11-07T06:05:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">Another reason is that currently the only reason cancels the context is the disconnection\r\n\r\nThis is not true.

You could have easily recognised this yourself just by trying to build the code we have. Since logging is a non-mission critical task to Thrift the very obvious solution was to make the argument option by adding `= default` and of course take care of that case when the logger is used. That way you are free to provide a logger but are not forced to do it, in which case it simply behaves as before. I'd consider this as the optimum solution.
