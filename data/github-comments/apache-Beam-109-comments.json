For things we want to share, we clearly\r\n> need a runner-grokkable payload. For things we don't want to share, we\r\n> clearly need an SDK-specific blob. Does that make sense? The part of this\r\n> that is new is the payload, otherwise the URN is just often not that\r\n> useful.\r\n>\r\nWe should strive to reduce ambiguity and redundancy. If both the payload\r\nand data are specified, which should the runner use? What if they don't\r\nagree? In all graphs, one needs a payload XOR a data.\r\n\r\nIf the URN is something the runner doesn't understand, the payload is an\r\nopaque (often SDK-specific) blob, which may be the serialized bytes\r\nsufficient to adequately specify it. This is handled by having SDK-specific\r\nnamespaces for the URNs.\r\n\r\n>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/278812797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/278815132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1968#issuecomment-278815132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1968","id":278815132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODgxNTEzMg==","user":{"login":"peihe","id":10201797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAxNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10201797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe","html_url":"https://github.com/peihe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-09T23:55:06Z","updated_at":"2017-02-09T23:55:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:
