 Thank you very much for your contribution. It is recommended that major changes be developed in a separate feature branch. If the changes can be completed before the release, they can be merged. Otherwise, due to the large scope of the changes and the relatively small number of active contributors in the community, it may impact the release of the next version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2461152548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/comments/2461489145","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3870#issuecomment-2461489145","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3870","id":2461489145,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACVE2c6St1f5","user":{"login":"vanshuhassija","id":33016642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDE2NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33016642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija","html_url":"https://github.com/vanshuhassija","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanshuhassija/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T07:17:57Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T07:17:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JiaLiangC The change does not impact the existing functionality in any way except the packaging for ambari-admin.

This could be the start of a new stage for web updates. I applied your code and tried running it locally, but I encountered a few issues:\r\n\r\n1. There's an unnecessary vite.config.js file, and the static asset entry isn't correctly configured in vite.config.ts.\r\n\r\n2. tsconfig.node.json file no found.\r\n\r\n3. The Bootstrap styles aren't compatible with the current Sass loader, leading to numerous warnings in the console.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1007\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6817cd6c-1880-43e4-8c02-d7d0727acc77\">\r\n\r\n4.

As and when stable, we will be able to remove the previously written versions of the modules and make the modernized one as the default version. \r\nHaving a separate branch for the same would mean development in isolation which is not the case.

The issues from the jQuery upgrade are still being addressed, and merging WIP code and files again will complicate troubleshooting. While I understand there are some isolation measures, this fundamentally undermines the long-term integrity of the main branch. It's suited for minor enhancements and fixes, but modular changes like these are precisely what a separate branch should handle.\r\n\r\nRegarding contributions, I think prioritizing the creation of a roadmap and sharing it with the community is a better choice.
