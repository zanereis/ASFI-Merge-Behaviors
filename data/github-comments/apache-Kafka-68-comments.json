Since the last member may leave the group before offsets have expired, this patch changes the behavior to increment the generation and essentially write an otherwise empty group metadata object to the log. The main idea is to avoid resetting the generation to 0 until it is safe to do so. This also helps users who currently have no easy way to tell if the group simply doesn't exist or it is dead with possibly some offset state left behind. \n\nCouple notes on the current patch:\n1. I've added a new `Empty` state to the coordinator's group state machine. This may be unnecessary, since it seems `Stable` could work as well, but I preferred slightly to keep the logic for this case separate. It also gets around the need to have a direct transition from `PreparingRebalance` to `Stable`, which should not be possible normally. Instead we allow `PreparingRebalance` to transition to `Empty` when there are no members left in the group.\n2. I've done a little bit of additional cleanup. The most notable change is the removal of the offset expiration lock in `GroupMetadataManager`, which seemed unnecessary with a small change to the offset loading logic. Rather than loading offsets directly into the cache, I first stage them in a local collection as is done with the group metadata. This should prevent the expiration thread from seeing stale values, but let me know if I've missed something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/221468430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/221500675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1424#issuecomment-221500675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1424","id":221500675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTUwMDY3NQ==","user":{"login":"miguno","id":294849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDg0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/294849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno","html_url":"https://github.com/miguno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miguno/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T07:59:43Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T07:59:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@enothereska : How would code change that uses lambdas for defining aggregators?

there's only 1 released broker version that supports this API, I think the discussion is a bit premature unless it dives into the expected behavior of 0.9 and 0.8 brokers. Otherwise the only direct use of this API will be once new broker versions / apis are released and clients can maintain backwards compatibility down to 0.10. \n\nFor now, since 0.10 is the most recent broker, backwards compatibility necessarily means 0.8 and 0.9 to users. So I think it is worth documenting here that 0.9 silently ignores the request and 0.8 forcibly drops the connection, or just recommend that the API not be used until 0.11 is released, at which point it can be used to identify 0.11 v. 0.10.\n\nfwiw, kafka-python deals with 0.9 and 0.8 brokers by pipelining two requests in sequence across the same socket: an ApiVersionsRequest followed by a MetadataRequest (v0). 0.10 brokers respond correctly to both requests, 0.9 brokers return a single MetadataResponse causing a correlation id mismatch error, and 0.8 brokers close the socket after the first request and cause the second request to fail (but this is racy -- may require request timeout).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/221721614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/221728594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1431#issuecomment-221728594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1431","id":221728594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTcyODU5NA==","user":{"login":"rnpridgeon","id":5313961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon","html_url":"https://github.com/rnpridgeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnpridgeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T22:37:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T22:37:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changed the settings to 10 files, 100m each since my previous settings were quite small \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/221728594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/221728750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1431#issuecomment-221728750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1431","id":221728750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTcyODc1MA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-25T22:38:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T22:38:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the PR.
