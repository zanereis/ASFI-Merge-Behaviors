At a minimum, definitely point out code convention stuff since those are trivial to fix anyway. This code was originally under Confluent's code styling and I reformatted, so there are likely a bunch of places I missed cleaning up. One thing I've noticed consistently is that since we use shorter lines, formatting often ends up a bit messier and spread across multiple lines and automatic reformatting won't fix that.\n\nFor KAFKA-2367, the intent in that JIRA was to focus on the API currently in copycat-data, which is curruently just a stripped down Avro with all the serialization code removed. I had initially left out \"data\" from the title of the JIRA which made it sound a bit different, despite the description being clearer. It'd be a good idea to come to some agreement on the APIs in copycat-api in this JIRA since they affect many of the other  JIRAs (and the runtime model for connectors).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/125262165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/125337665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/98#issuecomment-125337665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/98","id":125337665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTMzNzY2NQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-27T20:46:55Z","updated_at":"2015-07-27T20:46:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lvfangmin

This requires wrapping the actual payload in an envelope so we can ship the schema with it as well. I think we can make this optional (ideally in a later patch) by allowing the data API to express a catch-all schema, include a flag for serializers to allow them to read \"raw\" JSON and attach the catch-all schema to it. This will allow using existing JSON data, avoids the overhead , and will only be incompatible with copycat plugins that really require the schema (e.g. the HDFS connector may not be able to write that data in all formats).\n- Fixed the threading issue with the new consumer.\n- Simplified the serializers by getting rid of the specialized offset serializers and just reuse the existing producer/consumer serializer interfaces.\n- Switched to using consumer coordinator. This fixed a dependency on core.\n\nThis also gets it into a state where we don't have an external dependency. It should be easily testable for everyone now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/126489846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/126494010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/100#issuecomment-126494010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/100","id":126494010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjQ5NDAxMA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-30T21:22:01Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T21:22:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OKay, for case 1) I think it is okay to not exposing such APIs, and as long as that is not exposed users will not get surprises using it.

(cc @nehanarkhede since we discussed these settings recently) The question about generics was a good one. I've updated `Converter` and added generics as necessary based on the fall out. However, I noticed two things.\n\nFirst, with the current code this ends up bubbling all the way up to the `Worker` class. This makes sense since it syncs with the global converter/serializer/deserializer configs. However, now I'm thinking that might be a problem. Many connectors may want to use complex keys, but users may have existing data with simple keys, e.g. strings (not wrapped in Avro/Protobufs/Thrift/JSON/whatever). Currently we can't support both of these running in the same process since they require different deserializers/converters and the serializer/deserializer/converter are all set globally. This seems like it could be a problem for clustered mode where you want a lot of potentially diverse connectors to be running under the same workers.\n\nSecond, there's a similar issue with offsets. We got rid of `offset.key.serializer` and `offset.value.serializer` because there were a lot of settings. But if you want to be able to decode plain string keys but also decode complex offsets (as source connectors will need to do) you'll end up with a similar conflict.\n\nWe could definitely add the necessary settings and restructure the code a bit to support this, but it seems like it's going to add a lot of complexity. We'd need to at least add the offset key/value serializer/deserializer settings globally _and_ add per-connector settings for serializer/deserializer. The latter seems like it has the wost impact since it means every connector has to specify settings like this:\n\n```\nkey.converter=org.apache.kafka.copycat.json.JsonConverter\nvalue.converter=org.apache.kafka.copycat.json.JsonConverter\nkey.serializer=org.apache.kafka.copycat.json.JsonSerializer\nvalue.serializer=org.apache.kafka.copycat.json.JsonSerializer\nkey.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.copycat.json.JsonDeserializer\nvalue.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.copycat.json.JsonDeserializer\n```\n\nWith the new producer we also moved to a policy of not providing defaults for things like this because they lead to unclear error messages when something goes wrong such that users can't figure out how to fix the problem. We could simplify things by providing a worker/cluster-level default, but that seems like it could have the same problem as providing defaults in the producer.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/126991736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/126992097","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/99#issuecomment-126992097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/99","id":126992097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjk5MjA5Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-02T05:43:06Z","updated_at":"2015-08-02T05:43:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr

, Jun and Harsha found this. \nIn the current test, because we are producing messages to two partitions. The partitions might be on different broker, so the callback execution order might be different. In the test, when we call producer.flush(), there might be two different requests sent to the two brokers. In the callback of records sent to partition 1, we force close the producer. When the following two conditions are met:\n1. The first producer request sent to partition 0 somehow failed and producer request to partition 1 succeeded.\n2. The callback for producer request to partition 1 fired before the callback for partition 0 fired.\nIn that case, the producer will not retry send records to partition 0. So the test will fail.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/127821810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/127821897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/112#issuecomment-127821897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/112","id":127821897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzgyMTg5Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T02:27:16Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T02:27:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr
