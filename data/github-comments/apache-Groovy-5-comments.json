This change was already in place for extra decimal places (GROOVY-7344) so this just looks for the other cases which are probably not very likely (extra e/E or -/+) but thought should be added for completeness.  Prior to this change parse would be successful but these would throw exceptions on access since they are lazily evaluated as BigDecimals.\n\nI think the changes for the INDEX_OVERLAY parser definitely make sense, I'm a little less sure about LAX.  I guess the argument could be made that for LAX failing on access would be better than failing on parse.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/156867106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/157134211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/189#issuecomment-157134211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/189","id":157134211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzEzNDIxMQ==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-16T18:52:49Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T18:52:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

But I miss a test case for GROOVY-7420. As for the change itself... Not sure I feel too happy about diverging so much from the method resolution algorithm we use at runtime.  The distance calculation was supposed to catch the cases you have fixed here. Also with the advantage not to have to select the method multiple times. On the other hand I think the change will work without causing too much divergence.

I can have a second look to see if I can find a way to plug into the parameters/arguments distance calculation to bias against boxing/unboxing by adding a penalty. It did not seem possible the first time, and I didn't really want to impact the other callers of the modified methods (which is why the original method is overloaded with another one adding the `mode` parameter, and calls it with the same mode as before).\n\nRegarding the test cases, I'm not sure what test you feel is missing. There was [already one](https://github.com/fpavageau/groovy/commit/3583d6d95d664dcfc91402ec324905cf731cd1bd#diff-f6d8ec081f0cf2fcc6dfe44644e336ac) with a `@NotYetImplemented` annotation which is now removed, completed to test both primitive and object calls, and I also [added another test](https://github.com/fpavageau/groovy/blob/3583d6d95d664dcfc91402ec324905cf731cd1bd/src/test/org/codehaus/groovy/classgen/asm/sc/bugs/Groovy7420Bug.groovy#L43) to catch a failure I had while running the complete \"clean test\" build.
