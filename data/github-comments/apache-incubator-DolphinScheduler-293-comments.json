For the first point, we have the same situation with `spark-submit`, `spark-sql`, `flink run`, etc. besides `hive` considering permissions. We could abstract this and make it apply to all those task plugins. Would you like to submit an issue and give a shot? @zhuxt2015 \r\n2. `HiveServer2` is mainly used for `ad-hoc` query. In production, `HiveServer2` is not a good practice for scheduled big data tasks. We have seen several cases of production failures.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1231090467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1231094587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11668#issuecomment-1231094587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11668","id":1231094587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5JYQM7","user":{"login":"fengjian1129","id":35831367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODMxMzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35831367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129","html_url":"https://github.com/fengjian1129","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjian1129/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-30T03:22:55Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T03:22:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rickchengx @ruanwenjun I also submitted a PR # 9680, which needs to be the premise to fix this bug, because the application ID of yarn needs to be parsed in the program execution log and get appids,Please see the impact method in the following figure.
