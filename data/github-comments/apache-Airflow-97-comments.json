You probably need to monitor the watch process periodically and restart it on failure. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, what happens if the scheduler process dies, misses events, then when it's started up how do you know which events to look at. You can look at the history of all jobs in that namespace but that is very expensive. I need to look more into the watch api, but I know there is a way to specify from what version of a resource you want to start watching. If you could periodically persist the resource version you last watched from then on startup you could watch only from that specified event. \r\n\r\nOutside of the watch stuff, the big things left (we talked about these already) are failure modes of jobs getting stuck/retrying forever and how best to pass kubernetes configuration to tasks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/316547339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/316586180","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2458#issuecomment-316586180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2458","id":316586180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjU4NjE4MA==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T03:27:13Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T03:27:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tanmaythakur, thanks for your PR!

I wouldn't be very happy to have this in a release. But given the progress Allison is making with the other PR, one that I am willing to test, lets agree to disagree and help Allison as much as we can.\r\n\r\nI am happy to start a vote or discuss further with you via video chat if you feel it is important, please let me know. I believe pretty strongly in this change, but we should keep things democratic, and can revert the change based on the vote result. FWIW I did run this by Max early on, and he agreed with the change. In addition we created a thread in the mailing list to discuss these changes and hear people's concerns (though albeit not the slightly more complex logic that would be required on the logging side) since it was a decently-sized changed to the core.\r\n\r\n> Concerning this PR I though it existed of two commits, but you probably squashed them.\r\n\r\nI think we should follow 1 commit to 1 PR as much as possible on master to keep history linear and sane (and so that the JIRA tags will be unique and match correctly). I also think that 1 commit was a reasonable granularity for this change. The reason I asked Allison to create a separate commit instead of force pushing was so that it would be easy for me to safely review the changes from the 1st commit to the 2nd commit (really the 2nd commit was just bug fixes on the first one).\r\n\r\n> The description isn't really what/why, but more concerning is the lack of a documentation update as it does change things operationally. This can catch people by surprise as has happened with logging before.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely true, I was operating on the precedent of previous logging changes not being communicated, but I agree this is not a good excuse. I have asked Allison to create a follow-up PR to add some additional details to the log section of the configuration.rst document. If there are additional kinds of communication you think are warranted please let me know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/317103778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/317107604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2467#issuecomment-317107604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2467","id":317107604,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzEwNzYwNA==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-21T20:42:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-21T20:42:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@AllisonWang, thanks for your PR!

Having the tech debt from only the Elastic Search logging backend is OK, but if others use the abstraction then it will create considerable amount of work later, and it's hard to justify why Elastic Search should be a special case. We have decided to fork internally and once we finish testing/releasing the fork we will try to iterate on the changes in open source (the logging abstraction first, and this PR second). The issue is Allison only has ~2.5 weeks left and I think it will be very tight if we try to merge the logging abstraction. Let's leave/close this PR for now and hopefully Allison or myself will revisit it and the logging abstraction PR shortly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/317567042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/317575327","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2478#issuecomment-317575327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2478","id":317575327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzU3NTMyNw==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-24T22:39:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T22:39:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@diogoalexandrefranco, thanks for your PR!

That makes sense. I don't mind spending time on logging especially with the work @AllisonWang has already done, but not before the summer holidays probably. I do think we are pretty close to merging, because although it might not be perfect yet, it will give us the right starting point. Then we can start pushing ppl towards using it. \r\n\r\nFWIW: I understand what you guys want to accomplish here, but imho you are tying too much of Elasticsearch into Airflow. That includes the try_number. If we would properly track start_dates in a `task_instance_log` table you could use a standard EFK/ELK stack and still be able to split on `try_number` in the user interface. This would reduce the complexity of implementing logging (and being compatible with everything else) while still reaching the same goals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/317637414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/317638743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2464#issuecomment-317638743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2464","id":317638743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzYzODc0Mw==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-25T06:05:32Z","updated_at":"2017-07-25T06:05:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No not directly.
