We don't expect people to blow their entire metadata db away or to know what to change this connection to.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261464841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261615656","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1881#issuecomment-261615656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1881","id":261615656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTYxNTY1Ng==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T19:11:27Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T19:11:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261615656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261620489","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1881#issuecomment-261620489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1881","id":261620489,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTYyMDQ4OQ==","user":{"login":"TheF1rstPancake","id":1606890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake","html_url":"https://github.com/TheF1rstPancake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheF1rstPancake/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T19:30:51Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T19:30:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome!

We weren't sure where to have these end-to-end tests run. Since they take some time, we didn't want to have them run for each PR but there should be ways to at least run them nightly. I haven't kept up with the build and testing process since the project got into the Apache incubator so I can't comment yet here.\r\n2. @mistercrunch wanted to have configuration rewritten to avoid \"hacking\" how configuration works for this PR. I haven't heard of whether this has been done or not in the mean time. If it has, I could spend some time trying to rebase this PR. @mistercrunch can you give us an update ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261894545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261979560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1821#issuecomment-261979560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1821","id":261979560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTk3OTU2MA==","user":{"login":"danielzohar","id":6514918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTQ5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6514918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar","html_url":"https://github.com/danielzohar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielzohar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T16:00:04Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T16:00:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@r39132  just a reminder","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/261979560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/262036130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1891#issuecomment-262036130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1891","id":262036130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjAzNjEzMA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T19:10:48Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T19:10:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome!

I was also thinking about adding a demo endpoint to the web application that supports reads and writes but only used for this test. I'm okay with both approaches as it ensure we don't break in the future, though I like the ability to showcase reads and writes in the example -- hence I would lean to my latter suggestion of creating a new demo endpoint in the web app.\r\n\r\nIf you want to stick with using an external endpoints, we can make this more configurable in a few ways:\r\n\r\n- Specifying it in a Variable. We will still need to seed the variable table, which means an alembic migration\r\n- Specifying it in airflow.cfg, which I don't think is a good place for this just because we typically reserve that file for the airflow system (`i.e. webserver, scheduler, etc...`) and not for DAGs. We could create a new config file called config_dags.yml to hold configuration that can be read by dags, but then again, think the DB approach is cleaner.\r\n- Other ideas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/262089003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/262129079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1833#issuecomment-262129079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1833","id":262129079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjEyOTA3OQ==","user":{"login":"r39132","id":581734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132","html_url":"https://github.com/r39132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r39132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-22T02:20:14Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T02:20:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also interesting.
