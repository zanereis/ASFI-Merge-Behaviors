I have a user User1 who is a member of AD_Group1 which is associated with the \"admin\" role in Shiro. I have a dashboard for which I have configured AD_Group1 as reader, writer and owner. \r\nWhen I login as User1 and try to access the dashboard, I am getting the message \"But the user User1 belongs to: [User1]\". Clearly, Zeppelin is not aware of the group membership of the user.\r\nCan you please advise what could have gone wrong here ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/292493962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/292518627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2232#issuecomment-292518627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2232","id":292518627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjUxODYyNw==","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-07T12:02:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T12:02:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CI is green now.\r\n@jongyoul Could you help me to review this PR?
