Elsewhere I added an internal message method to set the value and note whether it is for transmission.\r\n\r\nIt doesnt feel like it should be setting a message property at all, only a header. I don't expect the TCK tests which check additional properties arent being added to the messages are using delivery-delay at the time..but they could. I know the older 'message property extension' scheduling stuff uses one, but its not clear to me this needs to. They could just be treated as separate mechanisms, which they kind of are already as you have to choose to respect the new value on the producer or the old one on the message.

We have a lot of custom code and impl there so we need to really dive into it to see if we can get rid of it or not or if we need to keep parts of it. There's also the possibility that we could refactor it but it's so much work it isn't worth it, but I hope not.\r\n\r\nMy initial assumption is we _should_ be able to refactor things with modern concurrent features of java and get rid of some of that but obviously TBD. So, I don't think you should delete any of this code as maybe we end up having to use the new virtual thread task runner you created, but since that's TBD and also a tech preview that is being tested, for now I think it's best in another branch for until we figure out the plan.\r\n\r\nI think we should take a look into the current implementations and see if they can be removed or improve/simplified as part of this. I can take a look soon.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2015202036/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2015322400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1172#issuecomment-2015322400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1172","id":2015322400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM854H2Eg","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-22T15:16:07Z","updated_at":"2024-03-22T15:26:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cshannon thanks for taking the time to review and providing the thoughtful feedback. \r\n\r\nI agree, the threading model can be improved and leveraging more modern Java constructs would improve performance and maintainability. Overall, I think ActiveMQ is a good candidate for Virtual Threads, because the key locks are already ReentrantLocks and we have NIO on the network layer. There are a few scatter synchronized methods/blocks in queue and topic, but those can be readily refactored.\r\n\r\nFrom my research of other OSS projects' (Tomcat, etc), they took a similar approach as I have proposed here -- getting Virtual Thread executor support as a configurable piece, and then use that to identify hot spots through profiling and end-user testing. From that perspective, I do feel strongly that we should work to get a configurable approach into the hands of end-users so we can get runtime hours in non-production environments. Unfortunately, I think the days of power users testing from a branch are behind us, so if we could work to some sort of compromise where its in the dist, but not guaranteed to not change I think we get the benefit of end-user testing which is really critical for this type of change.\r\n\r\nMy intent with 'Tech Preview' is to communicate that Virtual Thread support is available for testing, but not guaranteed to remain unchanged. I added the webpage to communicate that as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2015322400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2015372280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1172#issuecomment-2015372280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1172","id":2015372280,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM854ICP4","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-22T15:43:31Z","updated_at":"2024-03-22T15:43:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My initial comments of not to include it were because I thought you meant with Tech Preview as it's just for testing, etc and not really intended for users yet.

When creating a consumer on Topic A.B, first the new consumer is [authorized](https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/e025e443e65d4bd3c2c27f11d6caa7bfbd2c9626/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/security/AuthorizationBroker.java#L148) on that destination and that passes. \r\n\r\nBut then later on the addSubscription() is called for both destinations to add two subscriptions for the new consumer...one on A.B which is properly [authorized](https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/e025e443e65d4bd3c2c27f11d6caa7bfbd2c9626/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/security/AuthorizationDestinationFilter.java#L40) and then another on A.> which is not authorized because there's no proper ACLs for \"users\" when adding the subscription for A.>\r\n\r\nSo this is just how the broker currently works to handle wildcard subscriptions, since you are publishing to a wildcard topic then any subscription that matches needs to also subscribe tot he wildcard to get that message.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2043752900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/2043790765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1198#issuecomment-2043790765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1198","id":2043790765,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM8550cWt","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-08T23:09:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T23:09:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In terms of working around this, the options are pretty much:\r\n\r\n1.

Regardless, that `processConsumerControl() ` method has a bug and should be fixed I think and applies to really any protocol that might send it (even OpenWire if updating prefetch). \r\n\r\nThe purpose of that lookup is to wake up an existing destination for dispatching. So in this case really we just want to be looking up and not creating. This is an edge case because normally the consumer control would not be sent if the consumer hadn't already subscribed and created the destination, so obviously wildcards break this if not already created.\r\n\r\nFor a fix I think there's 2 options. One is to simply never create a destination in that method, just look up existing but I wonder if that could expose unintended bugs. Option 2 is probably safer and that is just to apply similar logic that exists in the `addConsumer()` method where if it's a normal destination keep the current behavior, but if it's a pattern/wildcard we just do a lookup only and skip if not found.\r\n\r\nI can work on a PR for option 2, should be a simple fix and I think makes the most sense.
