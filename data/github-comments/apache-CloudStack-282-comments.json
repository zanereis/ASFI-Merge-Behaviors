Cascade/facade and others of the same type to these common libraries will cause more pain than benefits, and in my not so humble opinion will add code without value… There are other patterns one can use to reduce these types of problems you are mentioning. For instance, the logger upgrade, all you need is to change the log configuration, and then change the logger object, right? However, the logging methods will be maintained (info, debug, and so on). That would be easily done if instead of declaring a final static logger object in all classes, we used an inheritance strategy. Therefore, we would reduce greatly the surface of an upgrade like this one. The same applies when using other libraries that are used in a great number of objects.

I just saw a lot of green through flue stricken eyes and merged.\r\n\r\nAs to the logging upgrade, @rafaelweingartner , whether the logging objects are static or instance members doesn't change much for the fact that they need to bee changed in every file. Also in case of a method rename (i.e. debug become deBug (which is a much more accurate camelCase name come to think of it)) We only need to change that in the proxy class and not all over our code. Reducing surface area for external libraries is a best practice in architecture. So is reducing the number of external libraries, which is of course a force opposing the principle of not implementing what is already out there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/361879495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/361880517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2433#issuecomment-361880517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2433","id":361880517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTg4MDUxNw==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T09:52:59Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T09:52:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@blueorangutan package","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/361880517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/361880784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2433#issuecomment-361880784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2433","id":361880784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTg4MDc4NA==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-31T09:53:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T09:53:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@DaanHoogland a Jenkins job has been kicked to build packages.
