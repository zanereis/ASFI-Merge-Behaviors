might not even have to do that much.\nWith [`logging.getLogger(<name>)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.getLogger), for the same value of `name` you're guaranteed to get the same logger object.\n\nSo in modules where you want to use logging, you could just have\n\n``` python\n...\nimport logging\n...\n# A module scoped reference to the logger named \"MXNet\"\n_logger = logging.getLogger('MXNet')\n\ndef foo(x, logger=None):\n    if logger is None:\n        logger = _logger\n    ...\n\n# Or alternatively, you could call `getLogger()`\nclass Bar:\n    def __init__(self, logger=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        if logger is None:\n            self.logger = logging.getLogger('MXNet')\n        else:\n            self.logger = logger\n```\n\nThe logger named \"MXNet\" could be configured, as you suggested, in the package's `__init__.py`.\n\nI've just been defining a separate logger object and then passing that as a keyword argument when appropriate, and so far it seems to work well.  \nI am pretty sure that this would be easy to set up, but I'd want to spend more time looking at the code to make sure I'm not inadvertently breaking something.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/214829394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/214866339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1952#issuecomment-214866339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1952","id":214866339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDg2NjMzOQ==","user":{"login":"starimpact","id":2155428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTU0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2155428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact","html_url":"https://github.com/starimpact","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/starimpact/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T19:52:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T20:07:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I guess people will have to pass in the generator function and a dictionary of keywords so that it can be rebuilt each time? That seems very inefficient though, especially if they start the generator by doing some sort of preprocessing.\n\nBasically, what I imagine is that a person will pass in a generator for an unlimited amount of data (say, you have a finite set but it randomly returns batch_size images from it), and then you specify the epoch size using epoch_size. You should only have to set up the generator once, and constantly get data from it, rather than rewind it (which you can't really do for arbitrary generators).

possible?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215162503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215193288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1974#issuecomment-215193288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1974","id":215193288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTE5MzI4OA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-27T18:57:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T18:57:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"try

MXNet really wants you to just make all of the inputs into `DataIterator` objects, and so far I've found everything runs more smoothly when I define the data's shape and the batch size explicitly. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215338200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215338270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1973#issuecomment-215338270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1973","id":215338270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTMzODI3MA==","user":{"login":"winstywang","id":4225664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjU2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4225664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang","html_url":"https://github.com/winstywang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winstywang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T07:47:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T07:47:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong Yes, but it still will fail the multi-gpu case, right?

As I understand things, using `DataIterator` for everything is a design decision to increase the overall speed and facilitate distributed training.\n\nAs for an example, how about MNIST with a convolutional net? I believe this is from one of the examples but I don't have the link handy right now.\n\n``` python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_mldata\nmnist = fetch_mldata('MNIST original')\n\n# Convert to float and scale between [0,1]\nX = X.astype(np.float32)/255\n\n# Reshape into array of  1x28x28 arrays... the 1 corresponds to only gray color channel\nX = X.reshape(-1, 1, 28, 28)\n\n# Split the data into training/validation sets\nX_train = X[:60000]\nX_test = X[60000:]\nY_train = Y[:60000]\nY_test = Y[60000:]\n\n# Create the iterators for the train/test arrays, note same batch size\nbatch_size = 128\ntrain_iter = mx.io.NDArrayIter(X_train, Y_train, batch_size=batch_size)\ntest_iter = mx.io.NDArrayIter(X_test, Y_test, batch_size=batch_size)\n```\n\nWe can check that the array looks right, so I didn't make a mistake w/ resizing\n\n``` python\n>>> X.shape \n(70000, 1, 28, 28)\n```\n\nBut we can also check what the batches look like:\n\n``` python\n# Get a batch\n>>> b = train_iter.next()\n# Batches keep track of both data and labels, we want data here\n>>> a = b.data[0]\n>>> a.shape\n(128, 1, 28, 28)\n```\n\nYou can then perform fitting like:\n\n``` python\n# Assuming you've compiled the model/module and you've got the rest of the keyword args in a dict\nmodel.fit(train_iter, eval_data=test_iter, **kwargs)\n```\n\nSo you can relatively easily define the iterators yourself, and it gives you a bit more control over the training process.\nAlternatively, you could try other frameworks like Theano/Keras or TensorFlow, or use those to prototype your network before using MXNet when speed/distributed training becomes more important.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215543832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215558587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1985#issuecomment-215558587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1985","id":215558587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTU1ODU4Nw==","user":{"login":"rldotai","id":12261158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjYxMTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12261158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai","html_url":"https://github.com/rldotai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rldotai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T20:51:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T20:51:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OK, I am unsure of how to get this to work since I already have a pull request pending, but there's some sort of issue with the linter so it hasn't been merged.\nSo now they appear to be two commits on the same pull request, #1977\n\nThe change I suggested was for `mxnet/python/mxnet/module/base_module.py`, altering line 247:\n\n```\n-            outputs = [out[0:out.shape[0]-pad] for out in self.get_outputs()]\n+            outputs = [out[0:out.shape[0]-pad].asnumpy() for out in self.get_outputs()]\n```\n\nI can attest that it fixed my issues using `predict` and seemed like the easiest change that would ensure similar behavior.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215558587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
