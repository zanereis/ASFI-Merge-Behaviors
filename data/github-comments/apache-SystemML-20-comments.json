If yes, then we merge this PR as is and if not, then as @mboehm7 mentioned \"the block-level integration needs to be moved to instruction level\". So the revised staging will be as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Either CP instruction-level dense integration or CP+Distributed block level dense integration.\r\n2. Decomposition kernels, TSMM, etc.\r\n3. Sparse? (staging of sparse depends on experiments 1.A for sparse data)\r\n\r\nI have created a experimental setup for microbenchmarks as per @mboehm7 suggestions. Here is how you can reproduce them:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/niketanpansare/incubator-systemml.git\r\ngit checkout switch_blas_experiment  \r\nmvn package -P standalone-jar\r\ncp target/systemml*standalone.jar SystemML.jar\r\nfor i in 1 2 ...\r\ndo\r\n        java -Xmx40G -server -cp SystemML.jar:commons-io-2.4.jar org.apache.sysml.api.DMLScript -exp $i\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding the sparse experiments, I implemented initial prototype for sparse matrix multiply, but for some reason the output is all zeros:\r\nhttps://github.com/niketanpansare/incubator-systemml/blob/switch_blas_experiment/src/main/cpp/libmatrixmult.cpp#L80 ... @bertholdreinwald @mboehm7 @nakul02 Since you have more experience with our sparse matrix multiplication, please let me know if you have suggestions to fix the bug. Once the bug is fixed, I can run the sparse experiments.\r\n\r\nThe end-to-end experiments are waiting for cluster availability.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/275763563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/275780966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/366#issuecomment-275780966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/366","id":275780966,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTc4MDk2Ng==","user":{"login":"deroneriksson","id":12634533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM0NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12634533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson","html_url":"https://github.com/deroneriksson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deroneriksson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T21:35:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T21:35:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Preview here: http://deroneriksson.github.io/incubator-systemml/\r\n\r\nChecked with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on OS X.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/275780966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/275781500","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/366#issuecomment-275781500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/366","id":275781500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTc4MTUwMA==","user":{"login":"fschueler","id":4837217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler","html_url":"https://github.com/fschueler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fschueler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T21:38:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T21:38:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I love that it is integrated, but the orange font-color is making me dizzy!

files, which we experienced with hadoop.dll and winutils.exe.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the main restriction is that the source releases can't contain binaries but the binary releases can contain

It's a great way to easily reference and run an algorithm and in no way prevents algorithm customization. If I would like to quickly demonstrate running an algorithm from the spark shell, most likely I would use dmlFromUrl (reference a script on github) or dmlFromReference (reference a script in the jar), and dmlFromResource would use the specific script packaged with the specific jar, so it's probably the better technique to use. So I would be in favor of adding dmlFromResource to the Python API.\r\n\r\nIf this PR looks good or if the Python needs any updates, please let me know.\r\n\r\n@mboehm7 @bertholdreinwald @dusenberrymw
