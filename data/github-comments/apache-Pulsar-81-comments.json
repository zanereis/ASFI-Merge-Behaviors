So everyone is encouraged to have an integration test for a new feature. However if you don't want to add one test in your current PR, please create a github issue for tracking the task of adding integration tests for NIFI connector.\r\n\r\nFor adding an integration test, you can checkout the tests at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/tree/master/tests\r\n\r\nYou can check plenty examples of integration tests for different IO connectors. for example, here is the kafka one - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/tests/integration/src/test/java/org/apache/pulsar/tests/integration/io/KafkaSinkTester.java","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/458271534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/458273734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3391#issuecomment-458273734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3391","id":458273734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI3MzczNA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T19:44:20Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T19:44:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run integration tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/458273734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/458274434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3457#issuecomment-458274434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3457","id":458274434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1ODI3NDQzNA==","user":{"login":"eolivelli","id":9469110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9469110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli","html_url":"https://github.com/eolivelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eolivelli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-28T19:46:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T19:46:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes some of  my customers have little clusters with Flat.
