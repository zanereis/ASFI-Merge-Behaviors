After your suggestion on the [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1598?focusedCommentId=15840763&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15840763), I have added a _PigSchema_, _PigToEnumerableConverter_ and associated classes in order to support Calcite SQL by the Pig adapter. Test cases in _PigAdapterTest_ show that the flow from SQL to Pig-specific relational expression trees to Pig scripts is now supported.\r\n\r\nThe big piece that is currently missing is actually executing Pig scripts and returning results via Calcite. I am working on that now, initially supporting Pig's local execution mode. Getting close. I'll leave it up to you to make the call on whether or not you want to check it into version 1.12 without this functionality.\r\n\r\nOther limitations of the existing Pig adapter impl:\r\n- Only supports VARCHAR columns. Need more data type support.\r\n- Filters are not pushed to be before joins. To be investigated.\r\n- Need expansion of supported functionality and test coverage for more permutations of filters, aggregations and joins.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/282888372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/283028162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/382#issuecomment-283028162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/382","id":283028162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzAyODE2Mg==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-28T12:37:23Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T12:37:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@julianhyde:
