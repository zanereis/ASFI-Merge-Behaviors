Cordova itself is not a browser engine and does not provide support for any ES features. Support for ES features relies purely on the underlying system browser engine. You can think of Cordova more like a packaging tool which packages your web assets into the native bundle.\r\n\r\nFor Android, the webview is decoupled from the OS and the user can upgrade the webview through Google Play. The webview is usually based off of Chrome. This means a single device **could** have a wide range of versions installed. For example, Android 7 factory comes with Chrome 53, but can be updated to the current latest through Google Play. You can observe this if you install a Google Play enabled emulator in Android Studio.\r\n\r\n> The error was due to this line in js.\r\nuser?.name?.verified\r\nI think this was due to ES5 or ES6 support issue.\r\n\r\n[Caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_optional_chaining) is an excellent resource to check for compatibility, but for the case of optional chaining syntax, you can see that support was added in Chrome fairly recently on Chrome 80 in the desktop version, but the `Android Browser` (aka the android webview), support for it prior to version 100 is actually unknown.\r\n\r\nSo to reliably use optional chaining, you must provide a polyfill or a build-time transpile using tools such as babel. I think react projects automatically include babel if I recall correctly.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I'm closing this as not a bug.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1108533692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1123933264","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/328#issuecomment-1123933264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/328","id":1123933264,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5C_dxQ","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-11T15:30:01Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T15:30:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hot updates is not something inherently supported by Apache Cordova.

In those cases, the plugin maintainers needs to update their plugins to use the `android:exported` on the activities they include.\r\n\r\nThe particular duplicate error is because you have two `<activity>` tags with the same `android:name` attribute. This could be caused by a conflict between your `<edit-config>` rules and (presumably) the plugin that adds these activity entries. If the plugin maintainers are unable or otherwise unwilling to update their plugins, it may be best to fork the plugin if their license allows it. Alternatively you can try writing a [hook](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/guide/appdev/hooks/index.html) instead of using `<edit-config>` that manipulates the `AndroidManifest`. \r\n\r\nThere are several known issues on `<edit-config>` that makes it very difficult to use, unfortunately.

Therefore I think it's fine to wait for updates of the underlying packages for the time being.\r\n\r\nAs for the reported vulnerabilities, they are from the `update-notifier` package. There are ways to forcefully force cordova to use a different version, such as version `6.x` of `update-notifier` which resolves the moderate vulnerabilities, however 6.x includes breaking changes that a simple test causes Cordova not to work properly. You can use `npm audit` to find more information on vulnerability to determine the severity for you.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1300690548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1322127069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/352#issuecomment-1322127069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/352","id":1322127069,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5Ozg7d","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-21T14:14:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T14:14:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Duplicate: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation/issues/255\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation/issues/255#issuecomment-1322124399","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1322127069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1323561514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/353#issuecomment-1323561514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/353","id":1323561514,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5O4_Iq","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-22T12:04:37Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T12:04:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Your ADB output doesn't really show anything relevant (it shows beginning of system boot but sometime before the application initializes Cordova).\r\n\r\nHowever, problems inside the webview generally indicates a logical problem in the application itself.

NPM Audit is littered with low risk vulnerabilities that is likely doesn't apply to you, or the app, or may only apply to the development machine but not the actual runtime, so there will likely be noise to shift through.\r\n\r\nI'd also suggest running `npm upgrade` to update your dependency tree with the latest dependencies that packages uses, before you run `npm audit` which will likely resolve most of any audit issues and reduce that noise.\r\n\r\nSince this doesn't describe a bug, I'll be converting this into a Discussion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1353309380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1355211479","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/334#issuecomment-1355211479","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/334","id":1355211479,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5QxuLX","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-16T16:52:09Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T16:52:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To addon...\r\n\r\nStarting with API 33, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission is going to change and be no-op, with 3 more specific read permissions replacing it, for audio, video and images.

Make sure that the application verifies that the sandbox is supported on the device before calling any other JavaScriptSandbox methods. The sandbox is supported on API 26 and above if the WebView implementation supports it.\r\n\r\nJavaScriptEngine is not production ready so it's not something Cordova can use right now, and even if it was, we would need to bump our min SDK to at least API 26. So it's not something I can see being implemented in the foreseeable future, but it would be an interesting experiment, which potentially be a cordova plugin.\r\n\r\niOS also has a similar system called [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore?language=objc) which is available as of iOS 16.0, so similar story to Android... in order to use this feature, it will need to bump our min version to iOS 16 which is too restrictive at this time. But likely implementable in the form of a plugin as an experiment.\r\n\r\n> I'm not certain how feasible this is due to the architecture of Cordova\r\n\r\nComing back to this, the main concern I have is Cordova makes a lot of assumptions and I don't think plugins will necessary have a guaranteed opportunity to control the webview instance just after the webview instance is created, short of implementing your own webview plugin. And if the JS is running in a background/service thread, it may not have safe access to the webview instance either. But these details may become more clear once these features are actually experimented with.\r\n\r\n**Update**:\r\n\r\nI've spent some time experimenting with Android's [JavaScriptEngine](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/javascriptengine) and I can say it's still very primitive. It only seems to only work on API 33+ devices (testing simulators). It's possible that the older simulators just simply doesn't have the proper webview versoin installed. Even with API 33, not all features are support, including a way to exchange data from native to the webview. The WebView API has an API to exchange data, and the JavaScript engine doesn't have the equivalent API. It **does** have an Array Buffer API which seems to be significantly better over the WebView counterpart, but it also appears to be one direction... native -> JS only. As far as I can tell based on the documentation transferring data from JS to native is not supported. Additionally I was an unable to experiment far with data buffer exchanges because the API 33 simulator doesn't appear to support the feature (probably requires me using a beta or alpha release of the webview).\r\n\r\nAnother note is the `JavaScriptEngine` has no APIs for debugging support as far as I can tell.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1368484057/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1397077135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/377#issuecomment-1397077135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/377","id":1397077135,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5TRbSP","user":{"login":"breautek","id":11200662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjAwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11200662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek","html_url":"https://github.com/breautek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breautek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-19T14:37:18Z","updated_at":"2023-01-19T14:37:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Moving this to cordova discussions as it doesn't relate to any bug or isuse within Cordova.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1397077135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1443802866","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/pull/382#issuecomment-1443802866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/382","id":1443802866,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5WDq7y","user":{"login":"NiklasMerz","id":3585860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODU4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3585860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz","html_url":"https://github.com/NiklasMerz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasMerz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-24T14:56:26Z","updated_at":"2023-02-24T14:56:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It does!

For example, if you want to use Node 16 by default, then you would do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnvm install 16\r\nnvm alias default 16\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can have multiple versions installed at the same time and switch between them (every Node install have their own global packages folder)\r\n\r\n```\r\nnvm install 18\r\nnvm use 18\r\n# now node/npm references are using Node 18 for the active session, but a new terminal will still 16 as the default as configured above\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause Node is user level, you don't need `root` or `sudo` to install global packages because they get installed at a user-level directory (inside `~/.nvm`). e.g. you can run `npm install -g cordova`\r\n\r\n> I cant install cordova for all students\r\n\r\nNVM is a user-level (shell) program, it won't be installed for all students. Any node versions installed through NVM is also user-level install, only your user has access to it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally because of this, you can now use `npm install -g <package>` without using `root` or `sudo` because these packages are installed under a nvm user-level directory. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ which node\r\n/home/norman/.nvm/versions/node/v18.15.0/bin/node\r\n$ which cordova\r\n/home/norman/.nvm/versions/node/v18.15.0/bin/cordova\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install NVM, see their [installation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to use NVM, it is also possible to configure NPM to not use a system directory which requires `root` by setting the [prefix](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-prefix?v=true) option. This config can be set to a user directory such as `~/.npm-globals` so that when you install global packages, it won't require `sudo`. But it sounds like you want a local user node install, not a system wide node install, so using NVM would be a way to achieve that.\r\n\r\nFrom a security standpoint, using NVM or at least configuring NPM to not use `root` owned directories is beneficial because it means you don't need to use `sudo` when installing. The drawback of requiring `sudo` is that you're giving many packages `root` level privileges during the installation, so you're making your self vulnerable to malicious packages that could do wide harm to the machine in general while running under root.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1506747916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1506822171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/384#issuecomment-1506822171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/384","id":1506822171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5Z0Egb","user":{"login":"damienf55","id":126759157,"node_id":"U_kgDOB44w9Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126759157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55","html_url":"https://github.com/damienf55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damienf55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-13T11:43:03Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T11:43:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, thank-you for helping.

Maybe this is the wrong way to establish this but don't hesitate to point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nNo worries, I just want to make sure the features aren't already available the webview itself, no reason to re-implement the wheel if they are. These thoughts are of my own and not representative of Apache, but if supporting text-zoom or other accessibility features does require a plugin to tap into native APIs, it will likely have to be a third-party community plugin that someone is willing to develop rather than an official Apache plugin. This is stemming from the fact that there is only a handful of core volunteers maintaining Apache Cordova and their volunteer time is usually taken by maintaining the core platforms, more so than plugins. But regardless of who decides to develop a plugin if it comes down to that path, it would be good to find out what is the required scope.\r\n\r\n> From my experience, iOS will force the larger text size only on native elements (ie not what you code in html/css/js).\r\n\r\nJust as a datapoint, I do know that Android system webview does respect font size accessibility adjustment. Which consequentially did break the UI of my apps, since they are not really built to have text sizes increasing...\r\n\r\nRegarding text zoom specifically, I didn't find any web api that really tells you whether text zoom is enabled or not or what the accessibility value is.\r\n\r\nHowever i found a [blog](https://scottvinkle.me/blogs/work/text-zoom) that kinda explains how build your web UI that will work regardless of text-zoom. The key takeaway is to stay away from absolute units like `px` and such and use flexible units like `rem` which is a unit that is relative to the root element's font size.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1564576681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1564771128","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/403#issuecomment-1564771128","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/403","id":1564771128,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5dRIM4","user":{"login":"BigBalli","id":427630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzYzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli","html_url":"https://github.com/BigBalli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBalli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-26T18:26:51Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T18:26:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"With

Is it something to do with the snap version of npm/node, I wonder?\r\nI'll try to repro with a non-snap version tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI do know that running apps under snap uses AppArmour which gives processes a fine grain control over what they can or can't do, or what directories/files they can access or can't access. I personally don't use snap cause often times these settings appears to be misconfigured for proper usage... at least that was my experience with them. But if you're running a snap version, and that's the version running in the same regular prompt, then I would have expected the issue to reproduce if it was an apparmour sandbox issue.\r\n\r\nI use `nvm` myself, which to me is the easiest way to manage using different node versions. So if you want to try different environments, I'd give that a go.\r\n\r\nIf all else fails...

Partly because there's only a handful of maintainers actively the project nowadays. Introducing a new platform, especially one that requires implementing compatiblity with new APIs, under a completely different build system is a daunting task... So unless if there is a large support from the community to maintain a new platform, I don't foresee a harmony platform coming to fruit. This is my own opinion.\r\n\r\nThe best way to see a harmony platform project, is to probably start a one. If supporting HarmonyJS will now require specialized tooling, then I'd recommend creating a platform. cordova-android can probably based used as a template for creating this new platform, just would have to strip out the android tooling bits and replace them with whatever what Harmony uses for it's build system. Electron has a mechanism to use `electron` plugins if available, but fallsback to `browser`. If this is applicable for Harmony, then Harmony platform could use `harmony` plugin implementation if available, but fallback to `android`, but it sounds like that might not be the case.\r\n\r\nIf a project is started with the intent to possibly get incorporated under Apache, then I'd recommend following Apache policies, namely ensuring that the project complies with the [third-party license](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html) policy and is capable of producing source-only releases that can be consumed by end-users. Binary build releases is ok but they must be accompanied with a source-only release and the binary build must be built from the source-only release. Using Apache Cordova code conventions would also be ideal.\r\n\r\nLastly, if a harmony platform project is made, I alone cannot guarantee that project can get incorporated under Apache as that would require approval and vote from Apache and their Project Member Committee.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1723357738/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1765356859","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/438#issuecomment-1765356859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/438","id":1765356859,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5pOTU7","user":{"login":"jcesarmobile","id":1637892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1637892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile","html_url":"https://github.com/jcesarmobile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcesarmobile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-16T22:13:54Z","updated_at":"2023-10-16T22:13:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favor of the discussion \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova/discussions/439\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1765356859/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/1819967657","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/433#issuecomment-1819967657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/433","id":1819967657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc5seoCp","user":{"login":"franva","id":5151146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTExNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5151146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva","html_url":"https://github.com/franva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-20T23:27:49Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T23:28:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @landall , actually HUA WEI should be the one more interested in implementing this Cordova plugin, and they do have one. \r\nNo wait needed :)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-cordova-plugin\r\n\r\nI can see that this repo is actively being maintained.

For example, android projects generated in a linux environment will use linux/posix file paths and windows version of the SDK will fail. Likewise an android project generated on a windows environment will have windows paths and will fail in a linux environment.\r\n\r\nIf you launch windows executables from WSL, it will launch the \"windows\" application and will trip OS environment checks, so it's important to install the linux version of the SDKs, like using a linux nodejs build to run Cordova.\r\n\r\nI'm using the android platform for examples because it's what I'm the most familiar with but other platforms will likely have similar situations. If a project has multiple build targets (like electron) then you might need to clean the platform when switching environments.

It's often due to the underlying SDKs and/or licensing issues.\r\n\r\nLike you said, anything Apple is pretty much only supported on Mac OS.\r\n\r\n> In the end, if code signing exe is the only thing electron builder needs to run in windows mode, there are other tools (just some Google searches) that you can use in Linux to sign the exe?\r\n\r\nFor code-signing windows apps on mac/linux it is possible and electron itself has a [guide](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/code-signing-windows-apps-on-unix) to do so making use of a GPL-3 licensed [tool](https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode). They are always license concerns surrounding around GPL packages. Apache isn't allowed to redistribute any GPL code or tools. So code-signing on linux is definitely not something that can be supported out of the box. The electron guide also notes using [jsign](https://github.com/ebourg/jsign) instead which is an Apache 2.0 licensed product, so that _could_ be a solution for codesigning window applications from mac and/or linux. In which case, I'd suggest creating a more specific feature request in [cordova-electron](https://github.com/apache/cordova-electron).\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the electron platform myself, so I'm not sure if the solutions are even accessible from within Cordova project.\r\n\r\n> Which in reality, as far as I know, electron does this approach?\r\n\r\nI believe so for the electron core itself. This is mostly because compiling electron involves compiling chromium which is a beast of a project. If the electron project depends on any node modules that uses native C++ addon API, unless if they also supply prebuilt binaries, cross-compiling won't be supported. Most node modules that does include native addons do not supply prebuilt binaries because it's significantly easier to distribute the source and have the workstation compile for their own environment against the specific nodejs engine, etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2231834746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/2231860917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/486#issuecomment-2231860917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/486","id":2231860917,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBzvngc6FB361","user":{"login":"cyraid","id":7562753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjI3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7562753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid","html_url":"https://github.com/cyraid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyraid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-16T21:31:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T21:31:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"That's interesting.
