@j143. I believe there are a couple issues.\r\n\r\n1) Looking at the LinearRegCG.dml script, it looks like the author of the LinearRegCG.dml script inconsistently made the input matrix 'y' lowercase (rather than uppercase, like 'X'). Therefore, `.in(\"Y\", Y)` needs to be `.in(\"y\", Y)`.\r\n2) Secondly, there is no variable 'B' in the script, so defining 'B' as a variable that shall be output via `.out(\"B\")` will fail. You could obtain 'beta_out', so `out(\"beta_out\")` would work.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that no checks are being performed for expected results. I think that is probably fine at this stage, since these test demonstrate that these scripts can indeed be executed using the MLContext API.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/326668659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/326699407","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/649#issuecomment-326699407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/649","id":326699407,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNjY5OTQwNw==","user":{"login":"akchinSTC","id":13340013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13340013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC","html_url":"https://github.com/akchinSTC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akchinSTC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-01T22:48:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T22:48:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\nRefer
