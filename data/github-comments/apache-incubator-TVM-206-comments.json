I agree with your methodology that we could customize the libinfo to deliver whatever we want. Apparently, it's impractical to parse camel.config and we have to manually setup the libinfo. With this statement, we should be able to have more flexibility in libinfo. For example, we even don't need USE_LLVM, USE_CUDA corresponding to cmake flags, but just need LLVM_VERSION, CUDA_VERSION.\n\nI think it's worthwhile to have an RFC discussing the libinfo contents (or we could refer to a previous RFC about benchmarking guidelines).

If we remove the dependency from the deleter to get the `DeviceAPI` through the (potentially destructed) `DeviceAPIManager` then the deleter doesnt depend on the lifetime of the `DeviceAPIManager` since it already has a pointer to the heap allocated `DeviceAPI` object.

reasons why prefetch and parallel are not supported in this PR are:\r\n1. The prefetch on Hexagon that we want to use is L2 rectangular prefetch (`l2fetch`), which works differently than the TVM's prefetch (at least at the time when we first added it).  We made some changes to how TVM's prefetch works to accomodate it, and upstreaming that would require more discussion with the community.\r\n2. There is a bug in the parallelization code that I haven't had time to upstream a fix for.  The fix that we have locally is not quite robust, so I'd have to develop a new one for upstreaming.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to get some basic Hexagon codegen working first, hence this PR.\r\n\r\nWe definitely plan to address the issues I mentioned above, it will just happen later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/676308315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/676381695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6302#issuecomment-676381695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6302","id":676381695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjM4MTY5NQ==","user":{"login":"tom-gall","id":1486358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1486358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall","html_url":"https://github.com/tom-gall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-gall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-19T13:44:13Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T13:44:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Also cc @tom-gall who sent a patch on top of my previous PR adding supporting AArch32.
