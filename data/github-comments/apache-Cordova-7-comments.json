It is *virtually untested*, making it probable that it is already largely broken. The little documentation that exists suggests using `plugman` which is terribly maintained, untested and broken and thus should be deprecated as well.\r\n\r\nBut most importantly, trying not to break a largely undocumented and untested set of features is an _incredible_ impediment when trying to refactor Cordova components toward a more reliable, modern and maintainable state. I cannot stress this enough, but this fuzzy concept that we call \"platform-centered workflow\" has complicated an awful lot of the refactorings that I planned or attempted. Examples include efforts to simplify/eliminate dependency management done by Cordova itself and stop copying our platform build tool libraries to the platform projects (which causes all kinds of nasty problems. See #32 for an example).\r\n\r\nI think removing platform-centered workflow support from Cordova would mean getting rid of a lot of technical debt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/645042473/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/647172246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/184#issuecomment-647172246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/184","id":647172246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzE3MjI0Ng==","user":{"login":"purefan","id":315880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan","html_url":"https://github.com/purefan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purefan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-21T19:40:19Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T19:40:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"- If you say \"reverse dns notation\" then we expect it to accept hyphens\r\n- If you can't accept hyphens because of Android that's ok, but then we expect it to be documented (I could not find this behavior anywhere but maybe I missed it)\r\n\r\nFor anyone else coming here through a web search:\r\nThis repository pulls dependencies from other apache repositories, the validation for the id happens when this project calls [the cordova-cli routine for create](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/blob/838a05784a3bc040fbf1ec223fba976663954234/src/cli.js#L348) which in turn [runs the validation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-create/blob/5f24bdbceba46830a46dc940306688b2d71f447a/index.js#L68) from [valid-identifier](https://github.com/purplecabbage/valid-identifier)\r\n\r\nSo one way to fix this _situation_ is to improve valid-identifier to throw an Error or implement some mechanism to bubble the offending part, seeing how valid-identifier has not been updated in a few years Id say chances of pull requests being accepted are slim\r\n\r\nIn other words, maybe the best place for a bug report is the cordova-cli project, and not this one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/647172246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/647184803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/184#issuecomment-647184803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/184","id":647184803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzE4NDgwMw==","user":{"login":"raphinesse","id":1006620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse","html_url":"https://github.com/raphinesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-21T21:35:37Z","updated_at":"2020-06-21T21:35:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> So one way to fix this _situation_ is to improve valid-identifier to throw an Error or implement some mechanism to bubble the offending part, seeing how valid-identifier has not been updated in a few years Id say chances of pull requests being accepted are slim\r\n\r\nActually, the `valid-identifier` package is maintained by Cordova's current PMC chair, @purplecabbage.

This is why you're seeing a min SDK conflict, it's letting you know that another library that you are using has a higher min sdk, so that library may not work properly on anything lower.\r\n\r\nIf you must support API 21, you can do so by using the `<edit-config>` tag to add what is mentioned in the error. However a little disclaimer... This puts your configuration into an unsupported state. It may work, but it may break in the future without warning and only when the app reaches attempts to execute the problematic code resulting in a hard crash. It will be up to you to test your app thoroughly on API 21.\r\n\r\nAn untested example should look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- The manifest doesn't have the tools namespace by default, so we'll need this to use tools:overrideLibrary\r\n<edit-config file=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" target=\"/manifest[@xmlns:tools]\" mode=\"merge\">\r\n    <manifest xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\" />\r\n</edit-config>\r\n\r\n<!-- Override cordova -->\r\n<edit-config file=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" target=\"/manifest/uses-sdk\" mode=\"merge\">\r\n    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\"21\" tools:overrideLibrary=\"org.apache.cordova\" />\r\n</edit-config>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocs for `<edit-config>` can be found at https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/plugin_ref/spec.html#edit-config\r\n\r\nSince this isn't a bug, I'll be closing this ticket.

Plus, it would be one more place to update if the graph were to change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/683981908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/683988308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/pull/240#issuecomment-683988308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/240","id":683988308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mzk4ODMwOA==","user":{"login":"raphinesse","id":1006620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse","html_url":"https://github.com/raphinesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raphinesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-31T19:35:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T19:35:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Looks good to me.

I will still create PRs for the changes.\r\n\r\nRight now I plan on doing two PRs (since the second one could be controversial):\r\n\r\n#### PR 1\r\n- use short notation for `repository` field\r\n- use short notation for `bugs` field\r\n\r\n#### PR 2 \r\n- set `author` field to \"Apache Software Foundation\"\r\n(This is what is used in most packages. How about using \"Apache Cordova Team\" instead?)\r\n- remove `contributors` field\r\n(@purplecabbage @dpogue You OK with that? You appear in at least some of them...)\r\n\r\nIf we agree on these changes up front, I could also throw these all into one PR per repo. Would be less work for everyone.\r\n\r\nRegarding the sorting: I tried `sort-package-json` on one of our files and I don't really like the ordering it enforces. I found out that there's also https://www.npmjs.com/package/format-package which has a configurable ordering.
