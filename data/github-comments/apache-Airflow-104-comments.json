If now, let me know if we're good to merge.\r\n\r\nCheers, Fokko","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330204306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330234788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2479#issuecomment-330234788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2479","id":330234788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDIzNDc4OA==","user":{"login":"0atman","id":114097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDA5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman","html_url":"https://github.com/0atman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0atman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-18T14:10:04Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T14:10:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Anyone fancy clicking merge?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330234788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330288428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2559#issuecomment-330288428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2559","id":330288428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDI4ODQyOA==","user":{"login":"awentzonline","id":5231065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzEwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5231065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline","html_url":"https://github.com/awentzonline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awentzonline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-18T17:05:55Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T17:05:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Turns out there are a few py3 incompatibilities here.

 wondering if the  reason for the 1G limit is very postgres specific, and very generous. You really should only be passing at most a small dictionary or map between tasks. It's probably fair in that it's more than adequate but a good safety protection.\r\n\r\nRegarding the absence of test, and the concern about not wanting to include a 1G file, you could generate a couple of fake files, one just under the limit size and one just over. A very small amount of code in the repo can be used to generate the files, then do the tests, then discard the files. \r\n\r\nI agree that failing would be preferable to silently inserting substitute data. Presumably xcoms are dependencies between tasks and downstream tasks are relying on it to continue the workflow. A fail on hard limit is easier to comprehend than a downstream tasks failing to unpickle expected xcom, principle of least surprise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330377578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330379476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2593#issuecomment-330379476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2593","id":330379476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDM3OTQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"tedmiston","id":366688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston","html_url":"https://github.com/tedmiston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedmiston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-18T22:57:55Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T22:57:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"To add another data point, personally I would rather see an exception thrown in this case.

As long as the arbitrary limit covers worst case with those databases then it's reasonable, and given that reasoning, a limit determined that way would no longer be arbitrary. I've just checked my MetaDB (MySQL using InnoDB) and the `xcom` table has a `value` column of type `Blob`. Blobs can be max 65535 bytes (mediumblob and longblob are allowed to be larger, but the type used is Blob), which is 64K https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/blob.html. \r\n\r\nI'm checking the Postgres docs and there is a section listed regarding BLOB that directs to large object support, which apparently allows up to 4TB, but uses some off table-tricks & metadata pointers. The other method listed is `bytea` or `text` which has a 1G limit per entry, so I assume that it where this PR comes from. The technique uses `TOAST` which involves storing data across multiple fixed 8k page rows.  https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/BinaryFilesInDB \r\n\r\nThere is also a section at the bottom \"when is it a bad idea to store binary files in the database\" which says \"Very large files (100meg+), where performance is critical to the application. The database layer adds a lot of overhead and complexity that may not be required.\"  \r\n100 may also be fairly arbitrary, but given the point of xcom is to be written and then read shortly after then minimizing this limit makes sense. \r\n\r\n_\"~~640K~~ 64K ought to be enough for anybody\"_\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330402099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/330412302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2613#issuecomment-330412302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2613","id":330412302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMDQxMjMwMg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-19T02:44:27Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T02:44:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2613](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/8e253c750d81da4e472049473767aaea0c504465?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `<.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613/graphs/tree.svg?height=150&width=650&token=WdLKlKHOAU&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #2613      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   70.94%   70.95%   +<.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files         150      150              \n  Lines       11734    11734              \n==========================================\n+ Hits         8325     8326       +1     \n+ Misses       3409     3408       -1\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/jobs.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9qb2JzLnB5) | `77.61% <ø> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [airflow/models.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9tb2RlbHMucHk=) | `87.15% <0%> (+0.04%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2613?src=pr&el=footer).

I've only put a 1GB limit as a safety precaution. On the Airflow fork we work with we use a much smaller limit (1MB), but I did not want to add an arbitrary behaviour to the original project. \r\n\r\nI understand why raising an exception may be a better option, but in the other hand if I'm not mistaken an _xcom_push_ is automatically triggered if your task has a return value. Which means that when dealing with big return values you must change your task behaviour for your DAG to terminate (for example by pushing the value to disk and returning the filepath as suggested @tedmiston). If this is the best way to do it, maybe we could add a section to the xcom part of the documentation.\r\n\r\nAnother solution I see would be to modify the _run_raw_task function in airflow/models.py to make it possible to disable automatic _xcom_push_. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/331439349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/331475650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2623#issuecomment-331475650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2623","id":331475650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQ3NTY1MA==","user":{"login":"dalupus","id":806458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNjQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/806458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus","html_url":"https://github.com/dalupus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dalupus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T15:13:50Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T15:13:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin is it the way you want now?
