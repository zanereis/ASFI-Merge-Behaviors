Something like:\r\n```\r\nmatch {\r\n  REGEXP_MATCH(pix_type, '^6-302.*') => 'cisco-6-302', \r\n  REGEXP_MATCH(pix_type, '^5-304.*') => 'cisco-5-304', \r\n  default => NULL\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis a lot easier to read and deal with.  Also, enabling REGEXP_MATCH to take multiple regexes via a list in the 2nd arg would make things easier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/403072604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/403074061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1083#issuecomment-403074061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1083","id":403074061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzA3NDA2MQ==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-06T15:53:58Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:53:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A big thumbs up to not embedding Stellar directly in JSON.

When I run this command in metron-deployment:\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests -Pbuild-rpms\r\n```\r\nI am still getting this error:\r\n```\r\n/var/tmp/rpm-tmp.VpikxG: line 60: npm: command not found\r\nerror: Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.VpikxG (%install)\r\n    Macro %_prerelease has empty body\r\n    Macro %_prerelease has empty body\r\n    Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.VpikxG (%install)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think your change may not have been pushed out correctly.  I still only see 1 commit in the PR when I would expect 2:  your original commit + the commit to fix this issue.  Because of this I'm also not able to see what you did to fix the error, I only see all changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/403567469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/403596584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1091#issuecomment-403596584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1091","id":403596584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzU5NjU4NA==","user":{"login":"jameslamb","id":7608904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDg5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7608904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb","html_url":"https://github.com/jameslamb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-09T19:41:12Z","updated_at":"2018-07-09T19:41:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@merrimanr Oh I force-pushed over the old commit.

It'd be better to either try to infer that initialization where possible or to externalize that logic.  Agreed that it's not this PR that should do that, but I would expect that we should probably consider a separate JIRA to the effect:\r\n* Decouple ParserBolt the parserbolt initialization and execution logic into a separate component from the Storm Bolt infrastructure (this will aid in NiFi or spark integration).\r\n\r\nThoughts?

That really helps.  I did not see in the code how we were sending out to the sensor topic and then into the sensor, I though the bolt was just calling the parser ( which makes the sensor specific topic not make sense ).  I think that this flow is a valid case, one where the data could be coming from either an aggregated flow into the topic *or* straight to the topic.  My question looking at this, is why ( esp when people are asking about reduction of kafka overhead ) can't we have the *option* to eliminate the sensor topic completely?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/405645826/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/405646929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1099#issuecomment-405646929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1099","id":405646929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTY0NjkyOQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T16:36:51Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T16:36:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ottobackwards I definitely think it's something we should consider adding and that's worthwhile.
