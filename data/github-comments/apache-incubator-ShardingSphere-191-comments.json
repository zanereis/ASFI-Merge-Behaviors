We can learn that there are two layers of principals, i.e., `Server-level` and `Database-level`.\r\n> \r\n> I assume that\r\n> \r\n> * `Server-level` privileges is bound to be mapped to our `AdministrativePrivileges` and `DatabasePrivileges`\r\n> * `DB-lever` privileges belong to `globalPrivileges` of `DatabasePrivileges` or `specificPrivileges`\r\n> * Still we have table some privileges putting into `TablePrivileges`\r\n> \r\n> Also, there are many different specific privileges on `server-level` and `db-lever`, right?
