I don't think row statistics are important because they represent values for different features. For column statistics, instead of implementing each statistic separately, we can compute all common statistics like (n, nnz, mean, variance, max, min) in a single job. This adds little overhead to the computation.\n\nBtw, `Vector.toArray` is an expensive operation for `SparseVector`.

We want `stop()` to do the right thing which is to wait for the second event to happen. However, as far as I can tell `waitUntilEmpty()` _only waits for the first event_. In the current uses of `waitUntilEmpty()` in the unit tests, due to manual control of the events posted to the listener bus the two events happen to be the same thing.\n\nIn the general case, I think it's crucial that we distinguish these two. For instance it's probably possible that during the execution of a job the event queue becomes empty (for instance, the consumption of the events is faster than the posting of the events) -- but that doesn't mean a call to `stop()` at such a moment should succeed; rather we want the call to succeed whenever the end-of-work `SparkListenerShutdown` message is processed. This is where the condition variable comes in.\n\nLet me know what you guys think ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39004007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39004142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/228#issuecomment-39004142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/228","id":39004142,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDA0MTQy","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-29T18:23:43Z","updated_at":"2014-03-29T18:23:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

The abstraction is supposed to be that the DAGScheduler handles the high level semantics of scheduling stages and dealing with inter-stage dependencies, and the TaskSetManager handles the low-level details of the tasks for each stage.  There are some parts of this abstraction that are currently broken (where the DAGScheduler knows too much about task-level details) and refactoring this is on my todo list, but in the meantime I think we should try not to make this problem any worse, because it makes the code much more complicated, more difficult to understand, and buggy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39004325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39004582","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/269#issuecomment-39004582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/269","id":39004582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MDA0NTgy","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-29T18:38:52Z","updated_at":"2014-03-29T18:38:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Merged build finished.

I took another look at this and have a question: what happens for stages that are used for multiple jobs?  Right now, stageIdToJobId in the UI code you added just maps a stage to a single job id.  So, if stage0 is used by JobA and jobB, the ui code only stores one of these jobs, and then cancelJob() will only be called for one of the jobs.  cancelJob() ultimately calls DAGScheduler.handleJobCancellation(), which only cancels the stages that are independent to the job.
