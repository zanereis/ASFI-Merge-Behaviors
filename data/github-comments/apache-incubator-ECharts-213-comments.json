As ECharts's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.\n\nAs a free and open source project, ECharts also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:\n\n1. Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);\n2. Improve issue triaging efficiency.\n\nFor (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals.

So none of `0` or `null` or `undefined` is valid when init. Although we could provide a default canvas size when container size is not given, it may cause some confusions (e.g., the user has defined canvas CSS width and height, and the size is not the same with canvas size).\r\nPerhaps we should change the warning expression to make this information more understandable. But I don't think providing a default canvas size when container size is a very good idea. Because first of all, setting container size is not a hard job for the user to do, as long as they know what's wrong here. On the other hand, providing a default value that users don't know how to change (calling resize) is a bigger problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/494246709/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/494255455","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/10510#issuecomment-494255455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10510","id":494255455,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDI1NTQ1NQ==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T06:19:52Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T06:19:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

I have solved this problem in my project.\r\n> \r\n> When I debuged my project, it would sometimes log the errors like this:\r\n>

execute this code:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> this.ctx.dpr = this.dpr\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> in `Layer.js` „ÄÅ`Painter.js`„ÄÅ`zrender.js` etc.\r\n> \r\n> So I detect the Layer.js file, in `node_modules\\zrender\\lib\\Layer.js` , I saw this code in a function named 'initContext':\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> initContext: function () {\r\n>     this.ctx = this.dom.getContext('2d');\r\n>     this.ctx.dpr = this.dpr;\r\n>   },\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I modified this function to the code below:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> initContext: function () {\r\n>     this.ctx = this.dom.getContext('2d');\r\n>     try {\r\n>       this.ctx.dpr = this.dpr;\r\n>     } catch (e) {\r\n>       setTimeout(() => {\r\n>         location.reload()\r\n>       }, 500)\r\n>     }\r\n>   },\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> And the bug resolved.\r\n> \r\n> I think this is a iOS bug happened occasionally, when the Layer.js or other Javascript library execute the command like `this.ctx = this.dom.getContext('2d');`Ôºåthe lib find `this.dom` is not found, `this.dom` here represent the HTMLCanvasElement. It exactly is a canvas element in most time, when the iOS javascript engines display correctly, but sometimes it would not, it was not found instead. So `this.ctx` is `null`, so it will throw error when execute `this.ctx.dpr = this.dpr;`.\r\n\r\nThank you.
