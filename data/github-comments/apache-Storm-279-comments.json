@ryanpersaud -- that is a very good observation, it would seem that doesn't happen.  I admit to being biased against rotation actions and would never use them in production, which is probably why I never noticed it.  But that's not a good enough reason for a bug like that!\r\n\r\nSince changing jobs last year I don't have the opportunity to actively work on Storm anymore, but if you have thoughts on a fix I would certainly give a code review my full attention. A failing unit test to confirm the behavior (using a Mockito spy to confirm that close isn't called) would be a very helpful start.\r\n\r\nThank you for pointing this

I'm <b>guessing</b> that 1.x-branch is for 1.1+ versions (excluding 2.0+), and that it excludes 1.0.x versions.  Is that accurate?  I don't think this change needs to be in 1.0.x, so long as we release another version of 1.1+ at some point before 2.0+ becomes a reality (which I assume is still many months away).  i.e., I just wanna have some version with this fix before 2018. <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\"

Yes, the numbers in the brackets for the executor thread are the tasks that executor is running, they should be set here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/a4afacd9617d620f50cf026fc599821f7ac25c79/storm-server/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/daemon/nimbus/Nimbus.java#L589\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/a4afacd9617d620f50cf026fc599821f7ac25c79/storm-server/src/main/java/org/apache/storm/daemon/nimbus/Nimbus.java#L589</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I think executor1 should correspond to tasks 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and executor2 should correspond to 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. How did you get the task lists you posted?</p>\n\n<p>I don't think it's exactly right that all the tasks in executor1 (3 10) will be reading from topics 4,6,5,7. Each task has its own spout instance (and corresponding KafkaConsumer), so only task 10 is actually assigned those partitions at the start of the log. I'm not sure how task 3 is even emitting anything? Is the start of the log the first occurence of partition assignments in the log?</p>\n\n<p>I also noticed that many tasks are emitting what appears to be the same message? e.g. </p>\n\n<div

Please find answers to your questions inline:</p>\n\n<p><b>How did you get the task lists you posted?</b></p>\n<div class=\"preformatted panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"preformattedContent panelContent\">\n<pre>Task IDs ------- 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18 ------------ Partitions 0, 1, 2, 3\nTask IDs ------- 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 --------- Partition 4, 5, 6, 7\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above table has been derived from the worker logs. For instance, if you search for <tt>kafkaspout 3</tt>, which means Task ID 3, you will find results for messages which are being read from partitions 0, 1, 2 and 3. This table seems to convey that </p>\n<div class=\"preformatted panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"preformattedContent panelContent\">\n<pre>  5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 correspond to executor1 and 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 18 correspond to executor2 </pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>If I assume that Executor1 should only be running tasks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, then only these tasks should be reading from partitions 4, 5, 6 or 7.</p>\n\n<p><b>I don't think it's exactly right that all the tasks in executor1 (3 10) will be reading from topics 4,6,5,7.</b><br/>\nSorry for the confusion, I meant only tasks in Executor1 should read from the partitions 4, 5, 6 or 7. I have re-worded the same in the description above. I agree that there is a possibility that not all the tasks will end up reading from partitions 4, 5, 6 and 7.</p>\n\n<p><b>Each task has its own spout instance (and corresponding KafkaConsumer), so only task 10 is actually assigned those partitions at the start of the log. I'm not sure how task 3 is even emitting anything?</b><br/>\nShouldn’t 3 more tasks (from Executor1) apart from task ID 10 be assigned to read from partitions 4, 5, 6 and 7. If there are more tasks than the number of partitions there should be one to one mapping between tasks and partitions is what I remember reading in the docs. Hence it is not surprising for me that task 3 is reading from a Kafka partition, although it does not seem to read from the assigned Kafka partition (according to the <tt>Setting newly assigned</tt> log line ).</p>\n\n<p><b>I also noticed that many tasks are emitting what appears to be the same message?</b></p>\n<div class=\"preformatted panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"preformattedContent panelContent\">\n<pre>e.g.\n2017-05-03 13:50:47.655 o.a.s.d.task Thread-8-kafkaspout-executor[11 18] [INFO] Emitting: kafkaspout 18 default [8topic, 2, 0, null, 1]\n2017-05-03 13:50:47.658 o.a.s.d.task Thread-8-kafkaspout-executor[11 18] [INFO] Emitting: kafkaspout 11 default [8topic, 2, 0, null, 1]\n2017-05-03 13:50:47.660 o.a.s.d.task Thread-12-kafkaspout-executor[3 10] [INFO] Emitting: kafkaspout 7 default [8topic, 2, 0, null, 1]\n2017-05-03 13:50:47.670 o.a.s.d.task Thread-12-kafkaspout-executor[3 10] [INFO] Emitting: kafkaspout 8 default [8topic, 2, 0, null, 1]\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>Are you deriving this information from the fact that all of the above messages have the same message ID (0) ? </p>\n\n<p><b>Is the start of the log the first occurrence of partition assignments in the log?</b><br/>\nNo, I have randomly taken a segment from the worker logs. I am attaching the full worker.log file in this ticket.</p>\n\n<p><b>Are you using automatic or manual subscription to Kafka?</b><br/>\nI did not understand the question. I am running Kafka on my local machine and using a KafkaSpout to read a topic from this local instance of Kafka. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613010272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613010276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6296#issuecomment-2613010276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6296","id":2613010276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMTAyNzY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T23:06:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:09:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srishtyagrawal9@gmail.com\">srishtyagrawal9@gmail.com</a>:</i>\n<p>Attaching the original worker.log file.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613010276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613010282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6296#issuecomment-2613010282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6296","id":2613010282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMTAyODI=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T23:29:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:09:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=srishtyagrawal9@gmail.com\">srishtyagrawal9@gmail.com</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Srdo\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"srdo\">Stig Rohde Døssing</a> the logs are as expected if the number of tasks are equivalent to number of executors.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613010282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
