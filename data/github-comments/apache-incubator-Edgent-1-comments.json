for taking this on:\n\nThe idea was for the splitter function to have the signature `Function<T,E>` where E is the enum type, so that the application developer just uses enum constants rather than integers.\n\nFor example if one was splitting on the severity of a log event and the log event class has a `Severity getSeverity()` method where Severity is an enum, then the split would look something like:\n\n`List<TStream<LogEvent>>  splits = logEvents.split(Severity.class, e -> e.getSeverity());`\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QUARKS-18\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/195994214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/195994854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/pull/6#issuecomment-195994854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/6","id":195994854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTk5NDg1NA==","user":{"login":"ddebrunner","id":3769612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Njk2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3769612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner","html_url":"https://github.com/ddebrunner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddebrunner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-13T16:50:09Z","updated_at":"2016-03-13T16:50:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I think the answer is \"no\".  I believe Range isa Predicate is only useful if the stream's tuples are \"primitive\" types (e.g., Integer).  In the probably very rare case where there is such a stream, lambda expressions make it trivial for the user to just supply `tuple -> myRange.contains(tuple)` (instead of just `myRange`).   Fwiw, while Guava Range implements its Predicate, the test() override is documented as deprecated and says callers should just use \"contains()\".  Seems like they now regret it being a Predicate.  Actually, for a short time I had this Range implement quarks Predicate and removed it :-)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/203158804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/203158857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/pull/50#issuecomment-203158857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/50","id":203158857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzE1ODg1Nw==","user":{"login":"Cazen","id":10334774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM0Nzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10334774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen","html_url":"https://github.com/Cazen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cazen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-29T23:36:27Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T23:36:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've carefully read your mention and it looks very helpful to me.\nI'll apply it to my next work!

I can see the picture properly.\n  But in Java8, There are strict rules when generate JavaDoc(it's not valid in HTML)\n\n```\nFilters.java:102: error: self-closing element not allowed\n     * <img src=\"doc-files/deadband.png\" alt=\"Deadband example\"/>\n       ^\n```\n\nOf course, we can just using -Xdoclint:none option to turn off, But I thought it's good to remove self-closing tag for avoid confusing.\n- I can see the '>' character in JavaDoc from Connector.java:49 of master branch correctly. \n  I just change it to with escapse, because it cause JavaDoc generate error. \n\n```\nConnector.java:49: error: bad use of '>'\n *                      -->C1\n                          ^\n```\n\nBut I think it's good idea to using '@code' tag rather than using escape like you mentioned. I will change it immediately.\n- `<code>` tag and `{@code}` tag are different in JavaDoc(http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html)\n  `<code>` tag does not replace \"<\" or \">\" automatically. It cause error\n\n```\n{@code text}\nIntroduced in JDK 1.5\n\nEquivalent to <code>{@literal}</code>.\n\nDisplays text in code font without interpreting the text as HTML markup or nested Javadoc tags. This enables you to use regular angle brackets (< and >) instead of the HTML entities (&lt; and &gt;) in documentation comments, such as in parameter types (<Object>), inequalities (3 < 4), or arrows (<-). For example, the documentation comment text {@code A<B>C} displayed in the generated HTML page unchanged as A<B>C. This means that the <B> is not interpreted as bold and is in code font. If you want the same functionality without the code font, then use the {@literal} tag.\n```\n\nI remained all '<' and '>' characters in `{@code}` tag, but replaced in `<code>` tag.(Like Tstream) to avoid error\nI can replace them all from `<code>` tag to `{@code}` if you agree about that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/206634352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/comments/206678456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/pull/58#issuecomment-206678456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-retired-edgent/issues/58","id":206678456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNjY3ODQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"kathyssaunders","id":16656337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU2MzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16656337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders","html_url":"https://github.com/kathyssaunders","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kathyssaunders/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-07T03:19:09Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T03:19:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing
