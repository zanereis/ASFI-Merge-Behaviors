This allows the same network to be trained with different batch sizes.\r\n\r\nSeems like mxnet infers information about shapes and data types at training, but doesn't store it in model files. `infer_[shape, type]` methods are the only way to get this info, but they require hardcoded variables.\r\n\r\nI try to implement Tensorflow Serving-like server that could handle any exported mxnet model, and serve it via HTTP api. But to do this I need to know:\r\n1. What data model is waiting for? (name of input, shape of input, data type of input) So server can prepare user data to be passed to inference method.\r\n2. What model will return after inference? (name of output, shape of output, data type of ouput) So clients of my server expect some specified values to return after they send a request.\r\n\r\nIf I put away my serving case: I got a mxnet model from datascientist to use in my app. Model ships with no documentation. I can't contact datascientist either.

sorry for replying late.\r\n\r\nSo there is a little bit of misunderstanding there it seems. The fix to the bug in NCCL 2.1 you are referring to will not make this test work in p2 instance with 16 GPUs (even though the actual NCCL integration works well in that scenario). It should only make the test fail gracefully instead of segfaulting.\r\n\r\nThere is a limit to the number of P2P peers any given GPU may have (it is a hardware limit for all PCI-E hardware, not just GPUs) - it is 8. NCCL under normal circumstances works fine with p2 instances with 16 GPUs under the same PCI-E tree because it uses a ring for communication, so each GPU establishes P2P access only between its neighbors in a ring.\r\n\r\nSo why is the test broken then? Because (being a test) it does a sweep over multiple configurations (in this case ring sizes), going from 1 to N (= number of GPUs in a node). During this sweep it produces rings as follows:\r\n0\r\n0 - 1 (gpu 0 opens P2P connection to GPU 1)\r\n0 - 1 - 2 (gpu 0 opens P2P connection to GPU 1 and 2 - it is a ring)\r\n0 - 1 - 2 - 3 (gpu 0 opens P2P connection to GPU 1 and 3)\r\n...\r\nAs you can see, during the execution of the for loop over test cases, GPU 0 opens P2P connections to GPUs 1,2,3,... and at some point reaches its limit of 8 peers (during ring 1 - .... - 9) and then fails during the 1 - ... - 10 ring test case. This is expected behavior (unfortunately). \r\n\r\nTo fully fix this test (which you can enable right now, btw, you don't need to wait for the next version of NCCL to do that) you would need to either:\r\n - split the test into 2 very similar tests - 1 covering range from 1 to 8, and second from 9 to 16 (which is very simple, just copy the test_nccl.py file and in the second copy remove limiter on `num_gpus` and do `gpus=range(9, 1 + num_gpus)` instead of `gpus=range(1, 1 + num_gpus)`)\r\n - make the test choose gpus assignment to ring smarter, like this (with 16 gpus):\r\n0\r\n0 - 1\r\n15 - 0 - 1\r\n15 - 0 - 1 - 2\r\n14 - 15 - 0 - 1 - 2\r\n...\r\nwhich would ensure that each gpu opens only up to 4 p2p connections.\r\n\r\nDoes this clarify the confusion? @leleamol ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/357388871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/357389137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9185#issuecomment-357389137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9185","id":357389137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzM4OTEzNw==","user":{"login":"fedorzh","id":5185993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODU5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5185993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh","html_url":"https://github.com/fedorzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedorzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-13T00:09:46Z","updated_at":"2018-01-13T00:09:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhreshold you used `resnet101_v2` but I talked about `resnet18_v2`;

That said, let's address your concerns step-by-step.\r\n\r\nSince @astonzhang has iterated with me on this over quite some time in #8763, there would be lots of context to help explain the motivation behind the design, on which Aston and I are happy to fill you in.\r\n\r\nThen, if you still think that API changes need to be done, I agree with @mli that if you would propose the desired changes through an email thread on dev-list, issues, or through a new PR proposal, it would be much preferred. Besides, I look forward to learning the more desirable design from you.
