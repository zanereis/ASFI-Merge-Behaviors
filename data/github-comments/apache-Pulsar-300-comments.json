It seems that the original tests are invalid. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the TestNG test suite is defined this way in `tests/integration/src/test/resources/pulsar-backwards-compatibility.xml`:\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM \"https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd\" >\r\n<suite name=\"Pulsar Messaging Backwards Compatibility Tests\" verbose=\"2\" annotations=\"JDK\">\r\n    <test name=\"messaging-backwards-compatibility-suite\" preserve-order=\"true\">\r\n        <classes>\r\n            <class name=\"org.apache.pulsar.tests.integration.backwardscompatibility.SmokeTest2_2\" />\r\n            <class name=\"org.apache.pulsar.tests.integration.backwardscompatibility.SmokeTest2_3\" />\r\n            <class name=\"org.apache.pulsar.tests.integration.backwardscompatibility.SmokeTest2_4\" />\r\n            <class name=\"org.apache.pulsar.tests.integration.backwardscompatibility.SmokeTest2_5\"

(before this PR) is that the containers get initialized for all test classes up-front. Since each test class uses BeforeSuite to start the containers and the container is held in a static field, this results in the last container to be initialized to be used for all test runs.\r\n\r\nI verified this behavior locally. Here is the output of `docker ps` when the first test starts executing:\r\n```\r\n❯ docker ps\r\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS
