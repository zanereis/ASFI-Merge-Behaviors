Kindly asking you to rebase your branch and update your commits by squashing them after the rebase.\r\n\r\nWhat could be a workaround to avoid creating brand new PRs is the following:\r\n- Rebase your branch with the latest develop (remote): Example: `git rebase origin/develop`\r\n- Squash commits: My favorable way: -> `git log`, find the commit hash just before the target commits, `git reset <commit_hash> --mixed` -> This way you wont lose the changes, but the commits are undone, Commit all the changes and now it became just 1 commit and finally `git push --force`. You need the force hence you were changing the git commit tree. \r\nHowever be careful with --force push, hence it is overriding the remote branch. But if the remote branch is your branch and noone else is working on it, then it is fine.\r\n\r\nTo avoid multiple commits, you might wanna amend your last commit if you realized something need to be changed again, and `git push --force` can push the newly amended commit to the remote (see above for the warnings!)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2017782594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2017968735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3808#issuecomment-2017968735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3808","id":2017968735,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ854R8Jf","user":{"login":"alberto-art3ch","id":154766431,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTmMXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154766431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch","html_url":"https://github.com/alberto-art3ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-25T13:05:43Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T13:05:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

By renaming the alias to 'off', we resolve this issue as 'off' is a valid alias and doesn't conflict with SQL keywords.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2036195396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2036207267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3829#issuecomment-2036207267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3829","id":2036207267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ855Xg6j","user":{"login":"alberto-art3ch","id":154766431,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTmMXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154766431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch","html_url":"https://github.com/alberto-art3ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alberto-art3ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-04T05:16:11Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T05:16:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Kindly add the proper FINERACT story for this PR and check my review!\r\n\r\nDone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2036207267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2036501789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3829#issuecomment-2036501789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3829","id":2036501789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ855Yo0d","user":{"login":"adamsaghy","id":7602740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDI3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7602740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy","html_url":"https://github.com/adamsaghy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamsaghy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-04T08:20:48Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T08:20:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please update the Commit message too!

a quick note... QueryDSL (the project) seems to have hit a bit of a slow down due to members occupied with work and studies... the good news: it seems that the people from OpenFeign jumped in and already made quite some significant improvements. Also: there is also a better way to generate the metadata sources with the Infobip extensions.\r\n\r\nI have contributed some improvements to both projects and hope they get accepted. The one for the Infobip extensions is a fairly small one, just trying to convince them to switch from `com.querydsl:*` to `io.github.openfeign.querydsl:*`; package names etc. are all the same.\r\n\r\nThe other PR on OpenFeign's QueryDSL fork is not relevant for what we need, just supporting a newer geo library (JTS) and the latest Postgis driver extensions.\r\n\r\nThe PR that would be interesting for us is the Infobip one (replacing `com.querydsl:*` to `io.github.openfeign.querydsl:*`).\r\n\r\nFYI\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/infobip/infobip-spring-data-querydsl/pull/101\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenFeign/querydsl/pull/416","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2088453983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/2093906425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/3795#issuecomment-2093906425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/3795","id":2093906425,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ858znn5","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-04T00:15:04Z","updated_at":"2024-05-04T00:15:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request seems to be stale.
