This works but as these suppressed exceptions are not a documented part of the SDK they are vulnerable to breaking in the future.\r\n* Attaching a metrics collector to the request specifically to grab the `CoreMetrics.RETRY_COUNT` value. This is publicly documented but means branching on a metric, which just feels odd. It also requires a side-channel to make this information available to the exception handler. Despite that, its probably the solution least likely to break.\r\n* Modify the AWS SDK clients factory to provide retry count via a side-channel. This breaks if a modified AWS client factory is being provided by the end-user.\r\n\r\n##### Option 5: Always check commit status if the thrown exception is an AWS SDK exception\r\nThis avoids all the retry introspection of the above approach, but means we end up spending commit time/latency checking the commit status when we might not need to. Its still preferable to risking corrupting the table state though.\r\n\r\n##### Current Plans\r\nOf these, Option 2 is easy to rule out for the reliability hit, and while Option 1 is the fastest and simplest its the most likely to leave orphan files behind. For the time being I am working on a pull request based on Option 5, as its a good starting point for further work if we go with Option 4 as well.  We might decide to go with Option 3 (or an option I haven't thought of) instead, but my priority is to get a viable fix available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1477096812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1477114026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5814#issuecomment-1477114026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5814","id":1477114026,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85YCviq","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-21T00:11:00Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T00:11:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has been open for 180 days with no activity.

If we are gonna give it a custom retry condition anyways, it would make more sense to create an [ExecutionAttribute](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/blob/master/core/sdk-core/src/main/java/software/amazon/awssdk/core/interceptor/ExecutionAttribute.java) we can attach to any individual API call we want not to retry, create a `retryCondition` that checks for it, and then build Option 3 using Iceberg Tasks as I described it above instead to avoid more side effects than necessary. The `ExecutionAttribute` and custom `retryCondition` can also be replaced with a second Glue Client, but that will require changes to the AWS Client factory interface, which is a public interface, so would rather avoid that.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary concern, right now, we actually treat a 500 error as a delete-the-metadata type FAILURE when the commit status after that could technically be SUCCESS or UNKNOWN. For example, its completely possible that Glue (or DynamoDB) could succeed on the backend and then error out during some post-commit step or even response marshalling.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1477156740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1477205029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7151#issuecomment-1477205029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7151","id":1477205029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85YDFwl","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-21T02:43:57Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T02:43:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1478295365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1478318029","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7096#issuecomment-1478318029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7096","id":1478318029,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85YHVfN","user":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-21T17:33:10Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T17:33:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">

That doesn't mean that we completely disable broadcast join for everybody. if your users are unable to disable broadcast join via config, then maybe you can disable it for them on your own fork so that it doesn't affect everybody else who is using Iceberg.

But in fact not all users know how to set it up, unless after OOM occurs, I think the cost may be even greater.\r\n> \r\n> I think this is always a problem with any spark job that involves join. If the join estimations are wrong you get OOM. That doesn't mean that we completely disable broadcast join for everybody. if your users are unable to disable broadcast join via config, then maybe you can disable it for them on your own fork so that it doesn't affect everybody else who is using Iceberg.\r\n\r\nYes, we have disabled it internally at the moment, but I personally think it's still not the best way. This is why I open this patch to the community, to see if anyone can optimize the action and fundamentally solve the problem of inaccurate estimates.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1478802983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1478847442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6661#issuecomment-1478847442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6661","id":1478847442,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85YJWvS","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T02:48:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T02:49:06Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"FYI, we are looking at refactor of existing partitions table to make this task easier, and alleviate concern about keeping large hashset ( @dramaticlly also mentioned interest in looking at it as well and may contribute)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1478847442/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1478854102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7158#issuecomment-1478854102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7158","id":1478854102,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85YJYXW","user":{"login":"amogh-jahagirdar","id":87500546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTAwNTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87500546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar","html_url":"https://github.com/amogh-jahagirdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amogh-jahagirdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-22T02:59:48Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T02:59:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My understanding is Ceph Object storage is S3 compatible, so one should be able to leverage `S3FileIO` to use Ceph https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/aws/#s3-fileio.
