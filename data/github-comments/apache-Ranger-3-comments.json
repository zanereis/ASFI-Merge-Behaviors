at the picture above, the first picture shows some hive audit logs, the second picture shows some prestodb audit logs.\r\n\r\n### explain the problem\r\nWe know Permission on the web page is the

which doesn't contain \"select\"([See this](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/security/authorization/plugin/HiveOperationType.java)). For example: HiveAccessType.SELECT can reference many Operation Type, like QUERY, SHOWPARTITIONS etc. You can find in [this code](https://github.com/apache/ranger/blob/7901d88e2aeac1d515581a0e987e7d4318da78b1/hive-agent/src/main/java/org/apache/ranger/authorization/hive/authorizer/RangerHiveAuthorizer.java). \r\nTherefore we can clearly judge that mismatch the value between Access Type and Action.\r\n\r\n### Test my code\r\nAfter I changed the code which is my submit and repackaged it, the web page show autit logs as I

Hi, can anyone share how to build the Trino plugin with 2.3 release i have tried the following but no tar file was created for trino plugin.\r\n> \r\n> mvn -Pall -DskipTests=true clean compile package

comment on this jira issue.\r\n> \r\n> thanks.\r\n\r\nI finally figured out how to do this, turns out you need to disable the distro linux profile and pick a few modules manually to make it work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd apache-ranger-2.4.0\r\n$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -P ranger-trino-plugin,-linux -am -pl distro,plugin-trino,ranger-trino-plugin-shim,agents-installer,credentialbuilder\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe artifact lands @ `target/ranger-2.4.0-trino-plugin.tar.gz`\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the linux profile in the distro module implicitly activates and overrides the ranger-trino-plugin profile maven config etc","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1548489920/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1548749306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/256#issuecomment-1548749306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/256","id":1548749306,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM5cUAn6","user":{"login":"mneethiraj","id":7771561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzE1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7771561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj","html_url":"https://github.com/mneethiraj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mneethiraj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-15T23:26:29Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T23:26:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kumaab

is useful for me when upgrading from version 2.1.0 to 2.3.0(RANGER-2789 has been reverted). \r\nIn the Ranger plugin, only policies and roles are synchronized, and there is no mapping for users and groups. In order to enable group authorization in the policies, and to ensure that only user-specific policies are passed in the plugin, we maintain a cache of user-to-group mapping in the plugin. The synchronization frequency of this cache is consistent with the policy synchronization time. We use the service/xusers/users API to fetch the user-to-group relationship. When there are fewer users, Ranger-admin runs smoothly. However, when there are a large number of users(2k), Ranger-admin experiences a significant number of blocked threads.\r\n\r\nthanks, RickyMa\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ranger/assets/126754736/3a57a212-f3b2-4820-8398-a64ac97b611b)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ranger/assets/126754736/92dbec97-4a28-48a7-b4e6-e0c2e11f6e5b)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1659515971/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1671905549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/252#issuecomment-1671905549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/252","id":1671905549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM5jp0EN","user":{"login":"sercanCyberVision","id":73108963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTA4OTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73108963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision","html_url":"https://github.com/sercanCyberVision","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sercanCyberVision/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-09T18:08:10Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T18:08:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mneethiraj could you please take a look at this?

(In our case, Ranger Admin was also built based on JDK 17.)\r\nAdditionally, there doesn't seem to be any code modification for `ranger-trino-plugin-shim`, but I think it needs to be modified.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1862864010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1868894879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/290#issuecomment-1868894879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/290","id":1868894879,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM5vZRKf","user":{"login":"okayhooni","id":81631424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjMxNDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81631424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni","html_url":"https://github.com/okayhooni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-25T09:47:13Z","updated_at":"2023-12-25T09:47:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@leeyh0216 \r\nSorry for the late response..!\r\n\r\n- We built and tested all the packages of Trino and Ranger with JDK 17 \r\n- I already committed the fixes on the `ranger-trino-plugin-shim` on this MR (https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/290/files#diff-afa003f80796be360546cf8a2827aaf0842ca3c6f296554e88ab87f5056107dc)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1868894879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/comments/1876963519","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ranger/pull/207#issuecomment-1876963519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/207","id":1876963519,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVRaiM5v4DC_","user":{"login":"Jetiaime","id":93769000,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZbNKA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93769000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime","html_url":"https://github.com/Jetiaime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jetiaime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-04T11:45:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T11:45:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Has it been completely modified?
