I just want to understand the rationale as to why you think they should moved as such and potentially exposing them (\"defaults\") in the graph that is being passed among passes? \r\n\r\nPS : I agree with @zhiics that this pass do not change the flow and agree with the most of the fixes that are brought in alongside the moving of \"default\" related components, though ideally should have been better if they were seperate
