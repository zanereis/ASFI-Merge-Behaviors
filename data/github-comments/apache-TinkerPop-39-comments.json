Since we already have those types since GraphSON 2.0 and they can only be used when the extended module is explicitly selected I guess that we don't have to take immediate action at the moment.\r\nUsage of the extended types is probably relatively low in general anyway.\r\n\r\nBut for the new serialization format @jorgebay suggested we should really check which types we want to support at all. I added a comment to the ticket so we don't forget that aspect.\r\n\r\nSo @danielcweber, looks like it would be best if you could remove all deserializers again for which no serializer exists and vice versa.

It gets deserialized to `TimeSpan`.\r\n3. You work with this `TimeSpan` and then send it back to the server.\r\n4.

I think you can merge this. I will do the deploy afterwards when I can tag the rc1 properly. If something goes wrong we can just CTR in some fixes. I'm feeling pretty confident about how this is going to work now after playing with things locally a bit. I also just pushed a minor update to make the command more like our others with `-DdockerImages` rather than explicitly using the `-P` directly which we typically dont' do.

Once we release 3.4.0 we need to remove the `latest` tagging from the `tp33` branch so that `3.4.0` will be latest. (I don't see a way to automate this so we really have to remember to do it manually before the release of 3.4.0.)\r\n\r\nThis should result in the following tags:\r\n* tp32 release candidates: 3.2.10-rc1\r\n* tp32 releases: 3.2.10, 3.2\r\n* tp33 release candidates: 3.3.4-rc1\r\n* tp33 releases: 3.3.4, 3.3, latest\r\n\r\nTo give a short explanation of why this tagging makes sense in my opinion:\r\n* Users who always want to have the newest version that is still stable can use the `latest` tag. This is also implicitly used when you do `docker run tinkerpop/gremlin-console`. So `latest` should always be available and always point to something stable.\r\n* Users who to stay on `tp32` for example because their graph provider doesn't support 3.3.0 yet can use the `3.2` tag and will always get the latest stable version of that branch. (Same applies of course to the `3.3` tag.)\r\n* All other users will select a version explicitly.

Most graphs don't natively support these Java Time types, so getting one you don't expect would be odd. I think the original intent for having these at all was to better support the old script API where you might do some calculations in your Gremlin script and return one of these types, so in that case, you would be in control of whether or not you used that type in the first place.\r\n\r\n> I am available to make the appropriate changes,... \r\n\r\nThanks, that's appreciated. \r\n\r\n> I just hope

Just let me know how you'd like to proceed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/396643883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/396869924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/873#issuecomment-396869924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/873","id":396869924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Njg2OTkyNA==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T09:10:56Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T09:10:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice doc on the new method, VOTE +1 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/396869924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/396872002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/872#issuecomment-396872002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/872","id":396872002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Njg3MjAwMg==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T09:18:28Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T09:18:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"VOTE +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/396872002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/397067300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/875#issuecomment-397067300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/875","id":397067300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzA2NzMwMA==","user":{"login":"vtslab","id":6702316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDIzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6702316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab","html_url":"https://github.com/vtslab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtslab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T20:03:17Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T20:03:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR is malformed due to problems in master.

I think I steered away from that because I initially misunderstood what marko meant - as you pointed out the plumbing (`incrLoops` taking a `stepLabel`) for nested repeats is already there, but I didn't find any plumbing had been done for this (neither `times()` nor `loop()` can take a `stepLabel`) so I thought that the 'work on `LoopStep`' had been abandoned. \r\n\r\nRe-reading this I think I see what is involved and can implement this - both `TimesModulating` and `LoopStep` as well as the `loops()` method of a traverser need to be able to take a stepLabel. We would need to maintain a separate user-defined stepLabel that could be accessed.\r\n\r\nI can see why `loops('a')` could be helpful, but I don't know why you would want to do `times('a',2)`. Could you please provide an example of this?\r\n\r\nPS Hi Marko!

Basically, you are trying to solve:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nfor(i=0;i<10) { for(j=0;j<10) if(i == x) …. } ….\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe point being, you want to be able to check for `i` and `j` counters not just at the loop check point but anywhere in the respective body.\r\n\r\nAnd note that naming `repeat()`s is not the same as naming the `repeat()`-step. It isn’t a step label……… though, some thinking on that might be worth it. In essence `repeat(‘a’,…) != repeat(…).as(‘a’)`\r\nthe ‘a’ in the first is for the loop stack, not for the step label….but again, perhaps there is a reason to unite the two concepts.

now added support for named loops - described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-967, however I have not introduced a new `times()` step. \r\n\r\nI think a new `times()` step would be of marginal benefit and could be confusing - currently `times()` is a step modulator on `repeat()`. \r\n\r\nI've also changed to explicit loop stack initialisation rather than setting it up on the

That's not a big deal - you will likely sort that with no performance penalty. On the other hand if you were to try to stream out a significantly larger graph that isn't completely in-memory then I believe the sort would add cost. If you can demonstrate that there is no cost then I would say we not only normalize by default but that we deprecate the configuration option and get rid of it. I think we'd always like to see normalization if there is no penalty for using it.\r\n\r\n> I am available for a code review over VOIP if you like to speed up things, Stephen.\r\n\r\nI'm in no rush :smile: - we have no releases officially planned so we can take our time.
