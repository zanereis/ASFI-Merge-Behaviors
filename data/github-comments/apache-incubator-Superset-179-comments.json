Our table has a column \"snapshot_date\" which has a type of DATE. We have multiple rows with the same \"snapshot_date\" value and want to create a bar chart which counts the number of rows in the last day.\r\n\r\nThis problem is exacerbated when using the DATE column type, because date comparisons ignore times. `'2018-11-09' >= '2018-11-08 hh:mm:ss'` will always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of hh, mm, or ss because the date on the left is later than the date on the right. Similarly, `'2018-11-09' <= '2018-11-09 hh:mm:ss'` will always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of hh, mm, or ss because the dates are equal. This is also a problem when using the TIMESTAMP column type, however, because the time window superset is currently producing is 86401 seconds (1 day + 1 second), rather than 86400 seconds (1 day).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nViz type and time controls on chart.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-11-09 at 10 37 54
