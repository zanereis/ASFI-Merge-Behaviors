It also applies only to individual DAG schedulers. It's potentially costly if a given DAG has a large number of tasks that need to be scheduled at the same time and the system has a large parallelism limit.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a stopgap for a race condition that we've run into a number of times. Longer term, I'm hoping to do a more thorough rewrite of the executor system but stopgaps solve problems and hopes don't.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/320796542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/320796662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2503#issuecomment-320796662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2503","id":320796662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDc5NjY2Mg==","user":{"login":"gwax","id":235458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax","html_url":"https://github.com/gwax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-07T22:20:42Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T22:20:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If there's a performance concern, I could put it behind a configuration variable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/320796662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/320799250","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2464#issuecomment-320799250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2464","id":320799250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMDc5OTI1MA==","user":{"login":"allisonwang","id":5182499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5182499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-07T22:35:43Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T00:43:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin I tried testing using `moto`, the testing lib for mocking AWS and `boto3`, but it doesn't work well with current S3_Hook as it requires passing in s3 connection object.

Reload the task table into memory on scheduler restart\r\n\r\n@bolkedebruin the `AsyncResult` is recorded in a dictionary within the executor instance. When the scheduler restarts, the executor state is created anew and the new executor instance does not have any knowledge of previously scheduled tasks that may be waiting in the queue.\r\n\r\nThe race condition that we've run into boils down to:\r\n\r\n1. pool_A has 5 slots and 20 tasks available to schedule\r\n1. scheduler schedules tasks 1-5, and waits on 6-20\r\n1. scheduler restarts\r\n1. scheduler schedules tasks 1-5\r\n1. now the queue is [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]\r\n\r\nIf task execution is slow, this can snowball. Prior to putting a few other ameliorations in place, we were regularly seeing many dozens of duplicated tasks during high load periods, which was massively decreasing throughput.\r\n\r\nThis is meant as a short term fix but I can see how it might be undesirable, even as such.\r\n\r\nWhen (if?) I can find time, I can look into a more complete and robust solution but I am also happy to defer to @saguziel, if there are solutions inbound.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/321088683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/321090912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2503#issuecomment-321090912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2503","id":321090912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTA5MDkxMg==","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-08T21:45:26Z","updated_at":"2017-08-08T21:45:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@saguziel if that is the case, having all options set, then I would open a new issue with Celery cause that is not what the other issues are about. \r\n\r\n@gwax afaik and understood from the docs, app.control.inspect queries the workers.
