On the other hand, I am interested in your approach. Could you provide a more detailed log about the exception when the configuration is `mysql:loadbalance`?\r\n> I am considering how to load balance leveraging the power of the database. Do you think PostgreSQL has a similar JDBC driver property?\r\n\r\nThanks for reply  @tristaZero ,\r\n\r\n`F5` was first used to make HA for sharding-proxy, but some problems happened. F5 was gave up, because we are not familiar with it, at the same time without enough time. \r\n\r\n\r\n### F5 problem\r\n\r\n- Sometimes error may occur when executing simple query SQL such as `select * from table-xxx`.\r\n- Maybe other problems, I can't remember more...\r\n\r\n### Loading-balance problem\r\n\r\nError occur for sharding-proxy [follows](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/blob/master/shardingsphere-proxy/shardingsphere-proxy-backend/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/proxy/backend/communication/jdbc/connection/BackendConnection.java) line 93. Just forbidden swith schema during transaction process.\r\n\r\nI thought this maybe some mistake between mysql's loading-balance strategy for switch schema, so follow stuff found:\r\n\r\n- mysql's loading balance proxy [LoadBalancedConnectionProxy](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/blob/release/8.0/src/main/user-impl/java/com/mysql/cj/jdbc/ha/LoadBalancedConnectionProxy.java) (line 602) will try to pick new connection after `commit` or `rollback` is called.\r\n- sync will be executed when `target` connection chosen during [pick](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/blob/release/8.0/src/main/user-impl/java/com/mysql/cj/jdbc/ha/MultiHostConnectionProxy.java) (line 405) process. `target` connection will copy `source` connection's `autocommit` and `database`.\r\n- autocommit flag still be `false` when `sync` method mentioned above is under executing, with 'change schema' followed.\r\n\r\nconclusion:\r\n1. `autocommit` status sync maybe drawback for loading-balance switch, or maybe the real pick could happen after a complete transaction and so on. \r\n2. mysql server can accept the logic of switching schema during transcation, so just considering the possibility of supporting it (I don't know about PostgreSQL, so please give your viewpoint).\r\n\r\nAlso, I will try for find more kind of adjust in client side, maybe loading-balance stratgy or other stuff.

point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/753619937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/753630472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/8869#issuecomment-753630472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8869","id":753630472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzYzMDQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-03T15:02:19Z","updated_at":"2021-01-03T15:03:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

It also cover the implement of balance based on strategy, such as random(default), bestResponseTime, serverAffinity.\r\n2. `transaction` is necessary to focus, because `switch connection` executes surely  at the end of `transaction`.

However, it is just like a `fridge`. That is, we need to put more valuable `food`(SqlNode transformation, planner, Interpretable) to it. The related classes are `SqlNodeConverter`, `PlannerInitializer`, `CalciteRawExecutor` waiting to be implemented.\r\n\r\nEspecially, I want to listen to your opinion how to get a `resultSet` if we use `Interpretable` of `Calcite` in `CalciteRawExecutor` (I have no idea about `resultSetMetadata`). Why do we need to get a `resultSet`? The reason is that we have to return `QueryResult` from `CalciteRawExecutor` to dock with the executor of ShardingSphere (Refer to `CalciteJDBCExecutor`).\r\n\r\n@guimingyue, do you have any plan for `SqlNodeConverter`, `PlannerInitializer`?\r\n@Aaaaaaron @junwen12221  I am unsure whether you still want to join in this feature (`CalciteRawExecutor` needs your attention).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/753959592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/754306075","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8736#issuecomment-754306075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8736","id":754306075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDMwNjA3NQ==","user":{"login":"kfwang90","id":16044973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDQ0OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16044973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90","html_url":"https://github.com/kfwang90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfwang90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-05T00:22:34Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T00:22:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @kfwang90,\r\n> \r\n> Hi your issue needs a little improvement.

Modify `pattern` in `PostgreSQLDataSourceMetaData` to support the this url `\"jdbc:postgresql://node1,node2,node3/accounting?targetServerType=master\"`.\r\n> 2. You can refer to `pattern` in `MySQLDataSourceMetaData`\r\n> 3. Since `pattern` is just a regular expression, it is easy to fix.\r\n> 4. Please add unit test in `PostgreSQLDataSourceMetaDataTest`.\r\n\r\nOK.

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/754306075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/754328278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8883#issuecomment-754328278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8883","id":754328278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDMyODI3OA==","user":{"login":"lmhmhl","id":24718258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzE4MjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24718258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl","html_url":"https://github.com/lmhmhl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmhmhl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-05T01:33:36Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T01:33:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

We recommend Java developers considering `jdbc:mysql:loadbalance` (i.e., LoadBalancedConnectionProxy) to do query load-balance on ShardingProxy instead of `F5`.\r\n2. You are suggested to set `autocommit` = `on` to avoid unexpected behaviors when loading balance.\r\n3. My tests and debugging of ShardingSphere convinced me it is highly possible there is a bug in `TransactionBackendHandlerFactory` when ``autocommit` = `off`,\r\n```java\r\nif (tclStatement instanceof SetAutoCommitStatement) {\r\n            if (((SetAutoCommitStatement) tclStatement).isAutoCommit()) {\r\n                return backendConnection.getTransactionStatus().isInTransaction() ? new TransactionBackendHandler(TransactionOperationType.COMMIT, backendConnection) : new SkipBackendHandler();\r\n            }\r\n            return new TransactionBackendHandler(TransactionOperationType.BEGIN, backendConnection);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWhen users execute set` autocommit=off`, ShardingSphere will return `TransactionBackendHandler(TransactionOperationType.BEGIN, backendConnection)`. However, MySQL has a different behavior with it. Plus, after setting` autocommit=off`, MySQL still allows users to use another database, but ShardingSphere doesn't keep up with it. (Line 93 in `BackendConnection`). \r\n\r\nBesides, it stays the same with MySQL when setting `autocommit` again after the first one (Implicit `commit`).\r\n\r\nI have no idea about `XA` transaction, so @yu199195 could you give more detail about these cases?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/755057420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/755110626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/8905#issuecomment-755110626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8905","id":755110626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTExMDYyNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-06T06:28:13Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T06:28:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
