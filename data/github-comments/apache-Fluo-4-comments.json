This situation was a little different because a pull request had gotten merged in yesterday in beta and the change needed to be made separate in alpha so it could be rolled forward (instead of rolling backwards). I also noticed that the version in beta had been set to \"fluo-1.0.0-beta-1\" instead of just 1.0.0-beta-1 and I wanted to get that fixed. It didn't appear there was ever a merge commit establishing the pom version change between alpha and beta. I think you are right- if the merge can be made cleanly then we should try to establish the merge only in github instead of doing the merge commit manually and then introducing another one through the pull request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/57469273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/57469674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/232#issuecomment-57469674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/232","id":57469674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDY5Njc0","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-01T14:11:14Z","updated_at":"2014-10-01T14:11:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm requesting the commit to go into fluo-io:1.0.0-alpha\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/57469674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/57470195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/233#issuecomment-57470195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/233","id":57470195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NDcwMTk1","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-01T14:14:33Z","updated_at":"2014-10-01T14:29:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I should not have merged #233 since there was comment here.   \n\nI am thinking we should submit a pull req to alpha, and only after that is successfully in, then submit a pull req for beta.

It contains 83 initial tickets marked for this first milestone. The roadmap for this release included a working initial implementation, completing an initial pass at the client API, and writing a stress test application. \n\n## Significant features\n\nThis alpha release contained a lot of initial features to help establish the basic implementation and client API. All of these features will be expected to become more robust over time.\n\n<h3>MiniFluo</h3>\n\nMiniFluo helps to get a quickly fire up a MiniAccumulo instance, initialize Fluo, and run an Oracle and some number workers that can be used for integration testing. This has largely allowed Fluo to be developed without the need for a full cluster. \n\n<h3>Observer API</h3>\n\nNotifications allow processing to be done on a worker as data is modified in one or more watched columns. The Observer API allows users to deploy their notification handling logic to the workers so that the code can be run server-side.\n\n<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>\n\nWithout garbage collection, the columnns in a Fluo table would grow without bound as updates are applied over time. Because of this, it's important to clean up old fully-processed (and no longer being read) transaction data. The initial implementation of garbage collection kept N versions of snapshots but Fluo-8 added the ability for garbage collection to collect all snapshots that are no longer being read by transactions anywhere else in the cluster.\\\n\n<h3>MapReduce InputFormat</h3>\n\nThe FluoInputFormat allows a specific snapshot to be read into a mapreduce job. It was established in Fluo-7\n\n<h3>FluoFileOutputFormat and FluoOutputFormat</h3>\n\nThe FluoFileOuputFormat enables the bulk ingest of a Fluo table using mapreduce by creating the Accumulo r-files in HDFS. The FluoOutputFormat pushes keys directly into the Accumulo tablet servers through the client API. Fluo-35 added this feature.\n\n<h3>Fluo Workers and Oracle running in Yarn</h3>\n\nFluo can use Yarn to manage fault tolerance and guarantee multiple worker processes and some number of Oracle processes are kept running across the cluster. Apache Twill was used for the Yarn integration. Fluo-11 added an application that will deploy Fluo to a Yarn cluster.\n\n<h3>Oracle failover</h3>\n\nThe Oracle provides monotonically increasing transaction timestamps. Having multiple Oracles deployed on a cluster with the ability to failover is important to maintain high availability of Fluo transactions. Fluo-15 and Fluo-3 provide this.\n\n<h3>Fluo API</h3>\n\nFluo provides a fluent-builder API for creating transactions to read and mutate data of various different data types in the Fluo table. This API was finalized in Fluo-23 and Fluo-98 when it was moved into its own module.\n\n<h3>Stress test</h3>\n\nIn order to determine that the Fluo works as expected, a Stress test was created that uses a tree to force collisions on transactions trying to mutate multiple columns at the same time. This was established in Fluo-24\n\nOther important improvements and features:\n- [Fluo-186] - Add Exceptions to API\n- [Fluo-175] - Add newTransaction() method to FluoClient\n- [Fluo-147] - Create fluo-accumulo module for Accumulo iterators and formatter\n- [Fluo-131] - Make LoaderExector implement closeable\n- [Fluo-130] - Expose MiniFluo in public API\n- [Fluo-123] - Hide implementation of Bytes in the API\n- [Fluo-98]  - Create a Range class for Fluo\n- [Fluo-89]  - OracleApp should allow configurable number of instances\n- [Fluo-16]  - Allow observer notification to be configured in AbstractObserver class\n- [Fluo-13]  - Register clients that perform transactions in Zookeeper\n- [Fluo-1]   - Create scripts for starting/stopping services\n\n## Testing\n\nTests were run using the Stress test module.\n1. Stress test was run successfully in < > minutes on 20-node cluster generating 2000 integers \n2. Stress test was run successfully in 10 minutes on a < >-node cluster against 5000 integers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/57683358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/57690055","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/issues/196#issuecomment-57690055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/196","id":57690055,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjkwMDU1","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-02T19:14:11Z","updated_at":"2014-10-02T19:14:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cjnolet

Documents are clustered by three clustering keys. In a real system, the clustering keys would be properties of the document like redirect target or content hash, but in this experiment we selected them uniformly at random from a collection of 750M possible keys. The average cluster in our synthetic repository contains 3.3 documents, and 93% of the documents are in a non-singleton cluster. This distribution of keys exercises the clustering logic, but does not expose it to the few extremely large clusters we have seen in practice. These clusters only affect the latency tail and not the results we present here. In the Percolator clustering implementation, each crawled document is immediately written to the repository to be clustered by an observer. The observer maintains an index table for each clustering key and compares the document against each index to determine if it is a duplicate (an elaboration of Figure 2). MapReduce implements clustering of continually arriving documents by repeatedly running a sequence of three clustering MapReduces (one for each clustering key). The sequence of three MapReduces processes the entire repository and any crawled documents that accumulated while the previous three were running.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/58283604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/comments/58353445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fluo/pull/256#issuecomment-58353445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fluo/issues/256","id":58353445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzUzNDQ1","user":{"login":"cjnolet","id":1242464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet","html_url":"https://github.com/cjnolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjnolet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-08T13:01:34Z","updated_at":"2014-10-08T13:01:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Accumulo master is at 14.
