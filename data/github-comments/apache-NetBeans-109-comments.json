It is located in the database explorer. There is no reason to duplicate that work. See `org.netbeans.modules.db.util.DriverListUtil` in `ide/db`.\r\n\r\nI know about `DriverListUtil`. I decided to duplicate couple of most used URLs for good reason. Templates in `DriverListUtil` are designed to support complex dialogs in DB Explorer, it covers almost all possible variants, supports all tiny details of URLs. It makes it less suitable for purpose I have in VSCode. UI of `DBAddConnection` quite different. It asks user for one field at a time. It is not able to display all field side by side as DB Explorer dialogs does. In VSCode the template would not be populated by values from the dialog. It will be displayed as is to let the user edit it. For this purpose `DriverListUtil` templates are less readable.   \r\nI believe that in this case the duplication is better than modifying `DriverListUtil` to support different UI workflow.

To that time, I could happily build `master` using JDK8 environment.

But the timing to actually publish plan's implementation was a little uncoordinated, IMHO. So if pioneering a change that affects the whole, it's better to be louder about it than just merge.\r\n\r\n> The NB13 VSCode support was built with JDK 11 too - https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Netbeans/job/netbeans-TLP/job/netbeans/job/release130/20/artifact/dist/vsix/ And that build job has support for VSCode plugin now - https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Netbeans/job/netbeans-TLP/job/netbeans/job/vsnetbeans_preview_1303/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/vsix/\r\n\r\nThat's interesting ! \r\nAnyway, if I just switched JDKs on my local machine, or for the vscode dev build ot Apache CI, the vscode build just failed as recorded in the link above. Most probably because changes that added `--add-modules jdk.jshell`  [for all unit tests were added past NB13](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/commit/7bc17f5dd0edb4c7f61f08a880c65522d4699feb)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1104297422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1104372855","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4013#issuecomment-1104372855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4013","id":1104372855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5B02R3","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-20T19:25:10Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T22:01:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"wait with merge please.
