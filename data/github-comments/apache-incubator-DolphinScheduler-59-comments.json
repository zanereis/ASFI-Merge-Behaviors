ConvertParameterPlaceholders2()` method to parse time expression ($[yyyyMMdd]), the code is always not be performed, because `ParameterUtils.ConvertParameterPlaceholders ()` method has been parsed.I think that in `ParameterUtils ConvertParameterPlaceholders2 ()` method is used the `schedule.time` to parse time expression is more reasonable","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/663987973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/664073506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/3308#issuecomment-664073506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/3308","id":664073506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDA3MzUwNg==","user":{"login":"rockxsj","id":3021207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj","html_url":"https://github.com/rockxsj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rockxsj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T01:30:24Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T01:30:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Good job, adding a new jar requires sending an email to dev and getting approval from PPMC.

is suggested that we should analyze which ones need to be modified according to sonar's suggestions, which do not need to be modified according to sonar's suggestions, and which need to be modified to implement the code.\r\n\r\nFor example: some bugs don't exist originally, but they will be recognized as bugs by sonar due to an extra keyword written in the code. However, sonar's suggestions sometimes suggest us to adapt these changes rather than revert them.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n建议我们应该分析一遍哪些是需要根据sonar的建议修改，哪些不需要根据sonar的建议修改，哪些需要去改实现代码。\r\n\r\n举例：有些bug是原本不存在的，但是由于编写代码时多写了一个关键字，就会被sonar识别成为bug。但是sonar的修改建议有时候会让我们去适配这些改动，而不是revert这些改动。\r\n\r\nIf you
