\r\n\r\nI have a a design issue perhaps you could comment on:\r\n\r\nA `ByteBuffer` has an internal ReadOnly / Writable state (as does a file).  Because we now have only one implementation, `WritableMemoryImpl`, the internal helper class `AccessByteBuffer` must return a `WritableMemoryImpl`. Similarly, the `AccessDirectMap` also returns a `WritableMemoryImpl`.\r\n\r\nClose():\r\n\r\nI do not provide close() in `Memory`, it is only available in `WritableMemory`.  I don't want downstream read-only users to inadvertently close the original BB or Map object.\r\n\r\nThis means that I can't provide in `Memory` a `public static Memory wrap(ByteBuffer)` or a `public static Memory map(file ...)` because ultimately these objects need to be closed so that the atomic valid flag is set to false and propagates to any child regions.\r\n\r\nSo the only way to create a RO `Memory` instance of a BB (or map) is via `asReadOnly()` from a `WritableMemory` instance. This also means that I cannot throw an error during construction if the user attempts to create a `WritableMemory` of a RO BB or Map.\r\n\r\nAnd, the only way during runtime to detect a write against a `WritableMemory` instance of a RO BB is when asserts are enabled. Can we live with this?\r\n\r\nMaps are safer in that if the file is RO, the OS will throw an error on an attempted write.\r\n\r\nAny better ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/283818272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/283821420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3892#issuecomment-283821420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3892","id":283821420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzgyMTQyMA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T23:54:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T23:55:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@leerho \r\n\r\n`Memory` should also be closeable, because it's needed for a common pattern:\r\n```java\r\ntry (Memory mem = Memory.map(file)) {\r\n  .. read something from file\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI didn't understand it clearly but probably the rest of the problem will go away also.\r\n\r\nDownstream read-only users can inadvertently close Memory: I agree it's not great, but currently I think it's a required trade-off (maybe my mind will change when we do actual Druid code migration and see how it works).

\r\n\r\nWhat is making things tricky is that we only have one implementation, `WritableMemoryImpl`, which allows problematic casts. I am beginning to feel that splitting into two impls would be a lot cleaner, safer, and just not worry about the 30+ duplicated methods.  I have already organized the code in the  `WritableMemoryImpl` class so that all the RO methods are together, so a simple copy & paste should be straightforward.  \r\n\r\nWith two impls, `asReadOnly` creates a new class, and going from a Memory to WritableMemory would never be possible.\r\n\r\n###\r\n**One impl:**\r\nThe readOnly flag is only checked on the write methods with an assert.  So if you cast a Memory object to a WritableMemory the readOnly flag will be true and not change and will throw an assertion error (with -ea).\r\n\r\nAs I explained before, ByteBuffers and Maps have their own internal RO/W state.  And because we have only one writable impl, we can end up with an RO map/BB wrapped by the writable impl.  This creates the need for the readOnly flag and the assert check of W methods.\r\n\r\nIf you do Memory mem = (WritableMemory)writableMem, the readOnly flag remains false (writable). the Memory API prevents writes,  but then this also allows a downstream client to do the reverse cast, since the underlying impl is the same.  I don't see any easy solution to this other than having two impls.\r\n\r\n###\r\nI do like the MemoryHandler idea as it isolates only those objects that actually require `AutoCloseable` from those that do not.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/284081143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/284082722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3985#issuecomment-284082722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3985","id":284082722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDA4MjcyMg==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-03T22:03:37Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T22:03:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1:\r\n\r\nnote: this PR adds following method to SupervisorSpec\r\n`List<String> getDataSources();`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/284082722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/284082804","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4003#issuecomment-284082804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4003","id":284082804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDA4MjgwNA==","user":{"login":"akashdw","id":5886276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5886276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw","html_url":"https://github.com/akashdw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-03T22:03:58Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T22:06:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm  tested puller pusher and it worked, but just found a small correction to be made.

The sequences for later chunks weren't created until earlier chunks had finished, and this had the effect of reducing load on the historicals (since they'd only see part of each query at once).\r\n- But, TWIST: Druid 0.6.71 included commit 1d1ec1d8556be02878b68f4daad1b6b0aaa886d0, which effectively disabled chunkPeriod since it bypasses chunking if `period.getMillis() == 0`, which is true for any period that doesn't have a millisecond component. To get a nonzero millis component you'd have to use a period like `\"PT60.001S\"` which I doubt anyone was doing.\r\n- Later on, Druid 0.7.1 included #1150, where chunkPeriod was re-implemented as `Sequences.concat(Lists.newArrayList(lazyIterableOfChunkSequences))`. Doing `Lists.newArrayList` creates the sequences eagerly, which sends queries to the cluster in parallel. Additionally, the sequences are created in a thread pool, and the the chunks are all wrapped in `toolChest.mergeResults(...)` before sequences are created, which for groupBy v1 means each chunk is merged in its own thread in parallel. This patch also fixed the `period.getMillis() == 0` check, so chunking started doing something again.\r\n- So in particular, #1150 changed chunkPeriod from something that was meant to decrease resource impact on historical nodes (by breaking up long queries and running them sequentially), into something that is meant to break up long queries and run them in _parallel_, which would either leave resource impact unchanged or increase it, especially on the broker.\r\n- The docs still say that chunkPeriod breaks queries into \"shorter interval queries, reducing the impact on resources\". I think the docs are wrong now in that regard.\r\n- The old behavior was useful at reducing resource impact for any query type, but the current behavior is only useful for parallelizing queries where `toolChest.mergeResults(...).run(...)` does merging eagerly, which is only groupBy v1. Other types like timeseries, topN, groupBy v2, all do merging lazily, so parallelizing the call to `toolChest.mergeResults(...).run(...)` isn't useful.\r\n\r\nMy question for you all: is this analysis correct and if so what should we do about it? Druid 0.6.71 and 0.7.1 are pretty old, so we've had the current behavior for quite a long time, and it seems to have gone un-noticed by anyone that might have been using chunkPeriod for its old purpose.\r\n\r\nMy vote for 0.10.0 would be to update the docs to reflect reality (chunkPeriod makes queries more resource intensive, not less, by parallelizing merging on the broker, and is only useful for groupBy v1). I'd also suggest including code to ignore chunkPeriod for groupBy v2 queries since it makes the results wrong, and even if that were fixed, it wouldn't really do anything useful anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/284171911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/284173541","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4007#issuecomment-284173541","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4007","id":284173541,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDE3MzU0MQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-04T19:07:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T19:07:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"üëç
