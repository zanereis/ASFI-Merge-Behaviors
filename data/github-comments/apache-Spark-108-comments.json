I looked more at the cache concern mentioned in hdfs-3545 and I believe the concern there was with Hive caching it across jobs.  In the Spark case, we have a single set of tokens/credentials per backend that won't be replaced. On yarn the RM deals with renewing the tokens.  They eventually expire after a week (or so) and you can't currently run anything longer then that.  I assume if someone is using token on mesos/standalone they have their own way to refresh or don't run for more then 24 hours, or have the config set much longer then default. \n\nI do still believe the better thing to do is move it up though.  We wouldn't have to have our own cached version as it does it for you, which I see as less maintenance, its less prone to someone adding code in a place that should be within doAs, and in general seems like it would be more secure and fit into a normal authentication protocol better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42087138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42088169","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/620#issuecomment-42088169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/620","id":42088169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDg4MTY5","user":{"login":"bouk","id":97820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3ODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk","html_url":"https://github.com/bouk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bouk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-02T23:14:00Z","updated_at":"2014-05-02T23:14:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Mesos `stderr` without this patch on master\n\n```\nWARNING: Logging before InitGoogleLogging() is written to STDERR\nI0502 17:31:42.672224 14688 exec.cpp:131] Version: 0.18.0\nI0502 17:31:42.674959 14707 exec.cpp:205] Executor registered on slave 20140501-182306-16842879-5050-10155-0\n14/05/02 17:31:42 INFO MesosExecutorBackend: Using Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\n14/05/02 17:31:42 INFO MesosExecutorBackend: Registered with Mesos as executor ID 20140501-182306-16842879-5050-10155-0\n14/05/02 17:31:43 INFO SecurityManager: Changing view acls to: vagrant\n14/05/02 17:31:43 INFO SecurityManager: SecurityManager, is authentication enabled: false are ui acls enabled: false users with view permissions: Set(vagrant)\n14/05/02 17:31:43 INFO Slf4jLogger: Slf4jLogger started\n14/05/02 17:31:43 INFO Remoting: Starting remoting\n14/05/02 17:31:43 INFO Remoting: Remoting started;

I'd prefer not to remove it from the dependency graph if possible because it will break local builds. The best solution I see is to add a profile for Hadoop 2.3 and 2.4. For now I'd be fine to just require users to manually trigger it and document this in `building-with-maven`. In SBT we can actually just insert logic in the build based on the Hadoop profile. I'm guessing we'll have to get into the habit of doing this, since it seems like Spark is good at finding bugs in Hadoop's dependency graph. We should probably start testing Spark against Hadoop RC's if they publish them to maven so we can give feedback.\n\nI don't quite understand why the hadoop-client library doesn't advertise jets3 specifically... if I write a Java application that opens an S3 FileSystem and reads and writes data, don't I need jets3 to do that (i.e if this is outside a MapReduce job)? Is this just a bug hadoop's dependencies?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42096004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42096048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/613#issuecomment-42096048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/613","id":42096048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDk2MDQ4","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-03T04:35:45Z","updated_at":"2014-05-03T04:35:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks I merged this. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42096048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42096177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/601#issuecomment-42096177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/601","id":42096177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDk2MTc3","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-03T04:43:10Z","updated_at":"2014-05-03T04:43:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Sandy, I've merged this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42096177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42096201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/468#issuecomment-42096201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/468","id":42096201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDk2MjAx","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-03T04:44:15Z","updated_at":"2014-05-03T04:44:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@srowen if you'd like to take a crack at this by the way, please do.

Probably it's for a different PR, but will probably make this and similar changes easy.\n\nWe need profiles to deal with this. Profiles can be triggered explicitly (e.g. `-Phadoop-2.3`) or by property values (`-Dhadoop.version=2.3.0`). It's necessary to have things like `hadoop.version` be customizable, so it would be nice to also trigger needed profiles from this. However, Maven lacks ability to trigger on a range of property values; you can trigger on a particular value like \"2.3.0\" but not \"2.3.*\" or \"[2.3.0,2.4.0)\" syntax.\n\nSo it seems necessary to use a series of named profiles. Those profiles can set default version values, and those versions can be overridden. For example, it's nice to have a `hadoop-2.3` profile set `hadoop.version=2.3.0` for you, even though that can still be overridden.\n\n(The SBT build can shadow these changes.)\n\nAfter reading over the build and docs, I propose the following:\n- Introduce a `hadoop-2.3` profile, similar to `hadoop-0.23`, to encompass 2.3+-specific build changes, and one for `hadoop-2.2` as well (see later)\n- `hadoop.major.version` appears to be unused -- remove it?\n- I believe `yarn.version` can be removed; use `hadoop.version` in its place. Ideally these are always synced, no? All doc examples show `yarn.version` matching `hadoop.version` and the distribution script uses `SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION` for `yarn.version`. Now, the default Hadoop version is 1.0.4 and there is no such YARN version. But the `yarn-alpha` profile sets `hadoop.version=0.23.7` to match the default `yarn.version=0.23.7` anyway. It seems like Hadoop 1.x + YARN is not intended anyway, which seems corroborated by the build documentation. \n- So, YARN-related profiles should not set `hadoop.version`, and in fact only serve to add the `yarn` child module\n\n... and then the fix for this issue is trivial.\n\nAll of the build permutations listed in the documentation work under this new arrangement. Anyone want to see a PR or have objections?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42102935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/42102979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/590#issuecomment-42102979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/590","id":42102979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTAyOTc5","user":{"login":"witgo","id":302879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo","html_url":"https://github.com/witgo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/witgo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-03T11:45:23Z","updated_at":"2014-05-03T11:45:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi
