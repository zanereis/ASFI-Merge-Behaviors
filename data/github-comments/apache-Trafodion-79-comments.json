The bug was\r\n    that in the presence of partitioning key predicates, logic that\r\n    communicates stop column information to the generator was being\r\n    bypassed. This would result in traversal to the last key predicate\r\n    at run time, with poor performance if the stop column was prior to\r\n    the last key predicate.\r\n    \r\n    Also included in this rework are some tweaks to the run-time debug\r\n    code for MDAM (the code had become non-functional from not being used\r\n    for a long time), and a fix to a run-time memory leak bug that shows\r\n    up as an assert when that debug code is

correct.  But we want to control both configuration setup and the location of the log files ( $TRAF_HOME/logs directory)  to enable us to use the standard log browser and other tools to look at the log files. If the T2 driver application needs to have its own log files, it can be configured in the application layer  but I wouldn't recommend changing the configuration of org.trafodion.sql and other C++ log entries via log4j to be modified. If the application needs to see these logs in their log, it can do so by enabling the appender in Trafodion configuration. In that case, I would propose a separate configuration files file for T2 driver and turn the appender on for this configuration so that the entries are logged both in the log file pointed by Trafodion configuration and the application configuration.  This should avoid duplicate entries seen with other components like trafci, sqlci, jdbc T4 and ODBC applications\r\n\r\n-1 for the change in the current

do please take a look https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html. if we want to specify the log file, at least 3 ways in stead of hardcoded. It's harmful for the current code because if you run your t2 process, you should know the logs before getConnection is not in the log file(trafodion.sql.java.log), and it's error level by default. if we change it to debug, all the other logs useless details will be printed because it's a shared config file. I was ask time and time again. Where is my logs after getConnection. DCS is using T2, it has its own log, but it was redirected trafodion.sql.java.log. true, we can add the VAR as you said, but if we want to change the settings like level, every time we have to remember to change 2 config files, one is in dcs while another is in $TRAF_HOME/conf. here the problem comes, $TRAF_HOME/conf is a shared config folder which will make all related modules taking effective. there will be a lot of useless logs while we only need the logs triggered by DCS.

I don't understand here. For log4j, again, it has other solutions instead of hardcode. Yes, it's true, we can move DCS logs into the directory as the others. Do you mean all the logs should go into one file( trafodion.sql.java.log)? Possible, but not very good maybe.  For SPJ we do the same thing? More and more programs are using T2. Every time the issues occur, we have to tell them that there is an variable with all other logs useless for your program. And another problem i was experienced, if i don't use log4j in my program, expected printing on console, the logs after getConnection still being in trafodion.sql.java.log. OpenTSD collector is also using T2, do you mean we have to add log4j config file? Collectors expected console output. I would suggest to use existing variable instead of a new one. whatever you create jvm by c++ or not, the settings could be configured in CLASSPATH, not hard coded. I dont agree to hardcode only.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/313894549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/314180916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1168#issuecomment-314180916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1168","id":314180916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDE4MDkxNg==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-10T17:43:29Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T17:43:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@robertamarton, could you take a quick look at this?

When you run a T2 application, the T2 jdbc, executor and compiler run within SQL processes.  The T2 client application is a java client and everything else is treated as server code. The java client application can log or trace any exception returned by the T2 calls. But the T2 internal commands are logged in the sql log file. If you use a HBase java client analogy, when you write a Java client that uses Regionserver APIs. the regionserver logs go into the hbase region server log but any exceptions thrown can be traced and logged on the Java Client side. The logging or tracing on the client side is entirely optional. This is true for T4 connections too. All errors on mxosrvr side are logged to the common trafodion sql log.\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems there is a disconnect here or I'm missing something in the interpretation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/314184777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/314190743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1160#issuecomment-314190743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1160","id":314190743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDE5MDc0Mw==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-10T18:18:06Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T18:18:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like you want the application writers to control where the log goes even when the log entry comes from Trafodion engine.
