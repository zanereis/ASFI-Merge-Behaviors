The `unsupported_operation_exception` coming from Kibana seems to be caused by the index templates not being loaded.  The Kibana dashboard expects certain fields to be of certain types.  Without the index templates, Elasticsearch likely chose a different type which caused the dashboard to blow up.  \n\nNow we need to figure out why Ansible did not create the index templates.  Digging through my logs, Ansible reported this when attempting to create the index templates.  This makes it seems like the templates exist, but clearly they were not created.\n\n```\nTASK [metron_elasticsearch_templates : Add Elasticsearch templates for topologies] ***\nok:

If it does not work, here is the work around. \n\n(1) Define which Elasticsearch master to work with.\n\n```\nexport ES_HOST=\"http://ec2-52-25-237-20.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9200\"\n```\n\n(2) Confirm the index templates are missing.  \n\n```\ncurl -s -XGET $ES_HOST/_template\n```\n\n(3) Manually load the index templates.\n\n```\ncd metron-deployment\nexport ES_HOST=\"http://ec2-52-25-237-20.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9200\"\ncurl -s -XPOST $ES_HOST/_template/bro_index -d @roles/metron_elasticsearch_templates/files/es_templates/bro_index.template\ncurl -s -XPOST $ES_HOST/_template/snort_index -d @roles/metron_elasticsearch_templates/files/es_templates/snort_index.template\ncurl -s -XPOST $ES_HOST/_template/yaf_index -d @roles/metron_elasticsearch_templates/files/es_templates/yaf_index.template\n```\n\n(4) Delete the existing indexes.  Only a new index will use the template.\n\n```\ncurl -s -XDELETE \"$ES_HOST/yaf_index*\"\ncurl -s -XDELETE \"$ES_HOST/bro_index*\"\ncurl -s -XDELETE \"$ES_HOST/snort_index*\"\n```\n\n(5) Open up Kibana and wait for the new indexes to be created.  The dashboard should now work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/227238255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/227238641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/158#issuecomment-227238641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/158","id":227238641,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzIzODY0MQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T19:07:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T19:07:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Those instructions in the situation where you have to adjust, can you add them to the aws instructions?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/227238641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/227238689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/158#issuecomment-227238689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/158","id":227238689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzIzODY4OQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T19:07:44Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T19:07:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"got my +1 after that\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/227238689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/227242547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/158#issuecomment-227242547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/158","id":227242547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzI0MjU0Nw==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T19:22:46Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T19:22:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sure.
