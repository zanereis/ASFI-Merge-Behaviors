The tricky bit is that the unified console uses Coordinator APIs, Overlord APIs, and Broker APIs. It currently runs on the Router because that is the only process type that can make all three kinds of APIs available (it proxies to them all).\r\n\r\nI think one of the following plans makes the most sense,\r\n\r\n1. Do it on the Coordinator, perhaps by falling back to a 'light' mode that only uses Coordinator and Overlord APIs. Not all functionality would be available. In particular, query functionality would not be available, as well as anything that relies on [system tables](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql#system-schema).\r\n2. Do it on the Broker, perhaps by folding Router functionality into the Broker (`druid.broker.asRouter = true`?). This would allow the Broker to proxy to the Coordinator and Overlord APIs.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about this right now I lean to the second idea (Broker) since it promotes the idea of a single server type that you use to interact with your Druid cluster. It feels like a simpler experience for especially new users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/524478504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/524488473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8150#issuecomment-524488473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8150","id":524488473,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDQ4ODQ3Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T23:07:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T23:07:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Do it on the Broker, perhaps by folding Router functionality into the Broker (`druid.broker.asRouter = true`?).

But, I am also not incredibly familiar with the Hadoop index task class loader stuff, so maybe I'm missing something important in that regards? I'll try to have a closer look and see if I can get a better idea of what specifically is going on in there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/524718117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/524726380","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7537#issuecomment-524726380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7537","id":524726380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDcyNjM4MA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T05:56:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T05:56:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request has been marked as stale due to 60 days of inactivity.
