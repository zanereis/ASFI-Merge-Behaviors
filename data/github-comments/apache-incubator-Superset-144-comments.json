I used VMWare 12.1.1 to install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. After installation I updated with the Software Updater.\r\n2. Next, I am following the instructions on [https://superset.apache.org/installation.html](url) as follows:\r\n2.a. In terminal, I used: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-pip libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev`. The installation went OK with no errors.\r\n2.b. In terminal, as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i), I installed: `pip install virtualenv`. The installation went OK with no errors.\r\n2.c. In terminal, I used: `sudo apt install virtualenv`. The installation went OK with no errors.\r\n2.d. In terminal, I sued: `virtualenv venv` as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i). The installation went OK with no errors.\r\n2.e. After, in terminal, I used `. ./venv/bin/activate` as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i).\r\n2.f. In terminal, as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i) and also in (venv), I used: `pip install --upgrade setuptools pip`, but the requirements are already up-to-date.\r\n3. Afterwards, I started to install Superset. In teminal (venv), as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i), I used: `pip install superset==0.24`. The installation went OK with no errors.\r\n3.a. In terminal (venv), as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i), I used: `fabmanager create-admin --app superset` and created default admin user with password. The config went OK: > Recognized Database Authentications. Admin User admin created.\r\n3.b. Also as previous point 3.a. in terminal (venv) as this user, I config the following: `superset db upgrade` and it went OK.\r\n3.c. Afterwards, as previous point 3.b. in terminal (venv) as this user, I config the following: `superset load_examples` and this also went OK.\r\n3.d. The same as point 3.c. goes for config; `superset init` which also went OK.\r\n4. Now, I started Superset, in terminal (venv) as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i): `superset runserver ` and it went OK, as follows below:\r\n>(venv) miki@ubuntu:~$ superset runserver\r\nStarting server with command: \r\ngunicorn -w 2 --timeout 60 -b  0.0.0.0:8088 --limit-request-line 0 --limit-request-field_size 0 superset:app\r\n\r\n[2018-05-17 11:01:23 +0000] [16859] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.7.1\r\n[2018-05-17 11:01:23 +0000] [16859] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8088 (16859)\r\n[2018-05-17 11:01:23 +0000] [16859] [INFO] Using worker: sync\r\n[2018-05-17 11:01:23 +0000] [16863] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 16863\r\n[2018-05-17 11:01:23 +0000] [16864] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 16864\r\n\r\n5. Went to Firefox 60.0 on address [http://localhost:8088/login/](url) and logged in with admin user. Everything is OK.\r\n6. Tested with Upload CSV into sqlite default Superset db and the CSV was imported in sqlite (main) as follows: `CSV file \"2017.csv\" uploaded to table \"2017\" in database \"main\"` with SQLAlchemy URI: `sqlite:////home/miki/.superset/superset.db.`` From this I tested with some charts / slices and everything is OK.\r\n7. Now, I logged out from Superset and stopped superset server and closed the terminal.\r\n8. Afterwards, I installed MySQL server, as follows: `sudo apt-get update` - OK, `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` - OK, started mysql with `sudo mysql -u root` and run in mysql> `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'miki';` - OK (Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)) and on the end mysql> `\\quit`.\r\n9. Next, I installed MySQL Workbench, as follows: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` - OK, `sudo apt install mysql-workbench` - OK. Started MySQL Workbench and created schema \"miki\".\r\n10. Now, I installed the instruction from [https://superset.apache.org/installation.html#database-dependencies](url) for MySQL, as follows: `pip install mysqlclient` in terminal as regular admin user (no root, sudo su, sudo -s, sudo -i), but it gave me error:\r\n> miki@ubuntu:~$ pip install mysqlclient\r\nCollecting mysqlclient\r\n  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6f/86/bad31f1c1bb0cc99e88ca2adb7cb5c71f7a6540c1bb001480513de76a931/mysqlclient-1.3.12.tar.gz (89kB)\r\n    100% |████████████████████████████████| 92kB 615kB/s \r\n    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:\r\n    sh: 1: mysql_config: not found\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n      File \"/tmp/pip-build-q2Ff6M/mysqlclient/setup.py\", line 17, in <module>\r\n        metadata, options = get_config()\r\n      File \"setup_posix.py\", line 44, in get_config\r\n        libs = mysql_config(\"libs_r\")\r\n      File \"setup_posix.py\", line 26, in mysql_config\r\n        raise EnvironmentError(\"%s not found\" % (mysql_config.path,))\r\n    EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found\r\n    \r\n    ----------------------------------------\r\nCommand \"python setup.py egg_info\" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-q2Ff6M/mysqlclient/\r\n\r\n10.a. I googled it: \"Command \"python setup.py egg_info\" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-q2Ff6M/mysqlclient/\" and did the following: `pip install --upgrade setuptools` - OK (and rerun `pip install mysqlclient` but still the same error), also tried as sudo su - but the same error.\r\n10.b. Next, I tried `sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev libmysqlclient-dev` - OK and rerun `pip install mysqlclient`. Now it went OK as follows:\r\n> miki@ubuntu:~$ pip install mysqlclient\r\nCollecting mysqlclient\r\n  Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6f/86/bad31f1c1bb0cc99e88ca2adb7cb5c71f7a6540c1bb001480513de76a931/mysqlclient-1.3.12.tar.gz\r\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: mysqlclient\r\n  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for mysqlclient ... done\r\n  Stored in directory: /home/miki/.cache/pip/wheels/50/c7/31/81a516762c8e9324f2b1fdffc1e84b9f07224fe3707956f6e1\r\nSuccessfully built mysqlclient\r\nInstalling collected packages: mysqlclient\r\nSuccessfully installed mysqlclient-1.3.12\r\n\r\nAfter I close the terminal.\r\n11. Finally, I got to SQLAlchemy URI (first started terminal: `sudo su`, and run `. ./venv/bin/activate` and after `superset runserver`). Then went on Superset in Firefox.\r\n12. In SQLAlchemy URI, I have tried the following: `mysql+mysqldb://root:miki@localhost/miki` and gives me error: \"ERROR: {\"error\": \"Connection failed!\\n\\nThe error message returned was:\\nNo module named MySQLdb\"}\"\r\n12.a. Also tried: `mysql://root:miki@localhost/miki` and `mysql+mysqlconnector://root:miki@localhost/miki` and the same error.\r\n12.c Next, I tried all 3x connection details in point 12 and 12.a, but with port 3306 after @localhost:3306/miki, and the same error.\r\n\r\nCan someone please point me out some solution or additional step to take into account because I tried everything and it does not work?
