It seems that the browser does not load the correct (ie, changed) scripts... Check out the screenshot -- it only shows the unmodified `@cancelJob = (jobid) -> $http.delete \"jobs/\" + jobid` and the inserted `stop` part is missing (I have almost no experience in web-dev stuff).\n\nI built the hole Flink project with `mvn -DskipTests clean install`; also delete maven repo to get rid of old stuff. I tried to reload (F5 and ctrl+F5 as well as clearing the cache; using a private window did not help either).\n\nCan you help me out?
