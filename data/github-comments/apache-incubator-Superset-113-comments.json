Looking forward to getting this in.\r\n\r\n1. I'm having trouble reproducing the 'range filter' bug. When I apply additional filters on the time axis (x-axis) in the 'Filter' section, it changes the location of an 'Event' and 'Interval' annotation correctly. It also applies the range correctly when I change the dates in the 'Time' section. Do you mind sending me a screenshot or something else that shows me how to reproduce this?\r\n2. You probably selected an 'Event' annotation which will only use the `start_dttm` of the `annotation` in the `annotation` table. If you want to see the 'rectangle' you will need to select 'Interval' annotation. \r\n3. I think those should be different annotation types. `mathjs` allows people that can not code and only know math to configure these annotations, which is part of our use case. We want to empower PMs to build their own dashboards. That said, I like the idea of having a more powerful JS eval in addition to this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/352199265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/352212731","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4069#issuecomment-352212731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4069","id":352212731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjIxMjczMQ==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-16T21:23:30Z","updated_at":"2017-12-16T21:23:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Whatever solution fits your problem it's out of scope of this project.

I agree that we should be extremely careful in what is exposed here, whatever goes in and out has to be treated like a public API, so no backwards incompatible changes should be allowed without release notes (if ever).\r\n\r\nWe do control exactly what is accessible in the sandbox. I pass the `console` object in the context by default so users can `console.log` all they want. For instance I also pass `underscore` and `d3` in there since there's a lot of utilities users may want, though that means that if we ever want to go `d3.v4` we would have to be careful in that regard somehow as we could break user reports.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking this through I'm removing `d3` from the context and keeping `underscore`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/352868223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/352870922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4076#issuecomment-352870922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4076","id":352870922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1Mjg3MDkyMg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-19T20:03:56Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T20:03:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"So this PR adds the new control but the control is not used anywhere.
