That results in unnecessary cast.\r\n\r\nThis is the same problem I mentioned earlier about conv weight, bias etc. But since they are float32 anyway, the default type we picked for them doesn't do any harm. Your use case is the first one we met where one of parameters to your model is indeed an integer tensor.\r\n\r\nEven though the dtype of `nodes_offset` tensor is int64, when we traverse a TorchScript graph and get the input type of rhs of `add` node via `inputs[1].type().scalarType()`, it returns None.  Surprisingly, doing explicit `self.nodes_offset.long()` in the Torch module  does make `scalarType()` of `node_offset` above int64. Note that this is a PyTorch problem, so I don't consider this a TVM bug.\r\n\r\nI'll look into a bit more on what's going on with typing of parameter tensors at the Torchscript level. We might end up solving \"Untyped warning\" problem of parameters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/676837709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/676843042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6300#issuecomment-676843042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6300","id":676843042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Njg0MzA0Mg==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T01:28:05Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T01:29:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"By comparing two Torchscript IRs, with or without ` self.nodes_offset.long()`, I now understands what's going on.\r\n\r\nWith the explicit cast, the rhs input of `aten::add` becomes the output of `aten::to(...)`, which does cast to int64.

@comaniac @junrushao1994\r\n\r\nZhi and I had a discussion with ARM folks today and here is a rough proposal:\r\n- `--target` could accept either a target or a JSON file path.\r\n- In the case of target string, it should match either a predefined tag (e.g., `rasp4b`), or it has to be a valid target string that can be parsed by `target.create()`.\r\n- In the case of JSON file, it must be valid to be parsed by target JSON parser.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the users that know nothing about the target can simply provide a tag.

This might revealed another problem, as the default data structure for ndim should be int32_t as in https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/blob/master/include/dlpack/dlpack.h#L136 So perhaps we want to change the API to use the new value.\r\n\r\nThere is always a temptation to use unsigned integers to represent values that can are non-negative. And there can be an active debate. On one hand, having unsigned values are great because we don't need to worry about negative checks like this one. On the other hand, unsigned values also creates potential problems, when there are a lot of implicit conversion between unsigned and signed, and potential underflow during subtraction.\r\n\r\nSo gradually my view has changed from use unsigned for non-neg values to use signed when possible. To make things consistent, perhaps we should change the arguments of these APIs to int or int32_t. \r\n\r\ncc @liangfu @areusch ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/678336322/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/678336776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/5215#issuecomment-678336776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5215","id":678336776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODMzNjc3Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T14:59:13Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T14:59:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"OK, we will leave the issue open then,  please remember to update it as we add more improvements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/678336776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/678339046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4828#issuecomment-678339046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4828","id":678339046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODMzOTA0Ng==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T15:03:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T15:03:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Unfortunately we need to close this PR due to inactive status.  \r\n\r\nThanks @Fwd-IV for the original contribution\r\n\r\n@Fwd-IV @FrozenGene @anijain2305 it would be great if you can coordinate to bring some of the PR up to the mainline and send a new PR.
