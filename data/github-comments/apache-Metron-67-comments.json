I can currently enter negative ports (which don't match anything) or ports beyond max int (which match everything!). Ideally this would also happen in the REST layer, because it kicks off jobs that have nonsense parameters.\r\n\r\nIt looks like @ruffle1986 added some validation [in this branch](https://github.com/ruffle1986/metron/commit/1c4bc69eb55d1ba96ce6d101516099d2a788ecf7). Are you fine with this being a follow up PR?\r\n\r\n> The UI doesn't appear to allow users to kill jobs (although the REST API exists for it). Is it correct that this isn't supported?\r\n\r\nIn the current iteration of the UI, a button to kill jobs is not available. I agree that we should add this to the UI, but if it's okay with you I think this could be a follow on PR. \r\n\r\n> The parameters differ if you've never entered a field vs. entered then deleted it. For example, for ports (and possibly just the two port fields), it'll be empty string if never entered and null if entered then deleted. This appears to be benign, although surprising.\r\n\r\nNice catch. I think we should open a ticket to investigate this further.\r\n\r\n> Kicking off a job, then navigating to the alerts view, then navigating back allows a user to kick off a second job. I'm not sure what happens when as these jobs finish in potentially either order (or any order if you repeat this and kick off many jobs).\r\n\r\nIf a job is now running, an error is returned from the API. The UI work to handle this is in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1122/commits/60f5d76d62f9b23dd44d9890b05c0101ae2b2080).\r\n\r\n> It's odd that the port fields have increment / decrement buttons. I would expect a user to manually enter that every time.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this was resolved by @ruffle1986 [in this branch](https://github.com/ruffle1986/metron/commit/1c4bc69eb55d1ba96ce6d101516099d2a788ecf7) by removing the type attribute on the input.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/408414672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/408420902","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1052#issuecomment-408420902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1052","id":408420902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwODQyMDkwMg==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-27T13:38:02Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T13:38:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1

The only thing I'm unsure of after reviewing this is your comment regarding this belonging in parser_master.py or not. On one hand, you could make a case that this is a parser like any other with the exception that it is spout-only. On the other hand, we don't currently provide a mechanism (iirc) to start/stop/manage the PCAP topology from Ambari. Starting parsers doesn't start PCAP, does it? \r\n\r\nIt may be that PCAP deserves its own \"master\", e.g. pcap_master.py, and lifecycle as a proper first class citizen (topology) within Ambari. Below is the current list of components, and PCAP is not in it afaik, even as a parser (there's a start_pcap_topology.sh script that is NOT the same as start_parser_topology.sh). It seems like if we're going to add this to Ambari we should also provide the ability to manage it. What do you think of that approach?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658443/43501393-84ffc056-9512-11e8-8846-ec003365dd01.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/409447590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/409448233","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1134#issuecomment-409448233","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1134","id":409448233,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTQ0ODIzMw==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T04:48:32Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T04:48:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MohanDV thanks for the contribution!

I think PCAP is really trying to be a first class citizen in Metron. We had fairly manual support for PCAP before.

This PR addresses the immediate need for exposing the parameters in `pcap.properties` via Ambari. It also addresses auto-populating the ZK quorum in `pcap.properties` thus simplifying the manual steps that would be otherwise required in a multi-node deployment. \r\n\r\nWould you be okay if we create a separate JIRA to cover the broader change?

Can you confirm, is that the way the properties are/will be deployed with this PR @anandsubbu?\r\n\r\nHi @mmiklavc - there is no change in behavior from earlier to now. Nothing changes from a usage perspective. Let me clarify more with an example for a multi-node deployment...\r\n\r\n**Earlier**\r\n* User deploys metron\r\n* `pcap.properties` file created with defaults under `$METRON_HOME/config`\r\n* User hand edits the properties file (sets ZK quorum and other parameters as required)\r\n* Starts the topology per the instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-pcap-backend#starting-the-topology).\r\n\r\n**Now**\r\n* During deploy time, user is presented with a separate config tab in Ambari to configure/reconfigure PCAP properties. If user chooses to leave them untouched, the pcap.properties is initialized with appropriate defaults. ZK quorum is auto-populated as well.\r\n* `pcap.properties` file is created during metron-parsers startup step.\r\n* Starts the topology per the instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-pcap-backend#starting-the-topology).\r\n\r\nThe steps in the [README](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-pcap-backend) still holds. \r\n\r\nNow, we can add a note in the README to indicate that the PCAP properties can be configured via the 'PCAP' tab in Ambari Metron config. But I noticed this was not explicitly mentioned for other components (e.g. [REST](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-interface/metron-rest#configuration), [elasticsearch](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-elasticsearch#properties)). Let me know if you prefer to have this added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/409668157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/409673106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1103#issuecomment-409673106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1103","id":409673106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTY3MzEwNg==","user":{"login":"tiborm","id":2437400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzc0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2437400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm","html_url":"https://github.com/tiborm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T18:21:31Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T18:21:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

considering the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Let's say I manually make changes to `pcap.properties`. I restart the parser topologies. Later, I manually restart pcap with the shell command. What happens to my `pcap.properties` changes?\r\n2. Similarly, I make changes via Ambari's new PCAP panel. Now I go start pcap using `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_pcap_topology.sh`. What does pcap.properties look like?\r\n\r\nIn 1, your changes are overwritten by the parsers' restart. In 2, you've made changes in Ambari but they don't get materialized in the properties file because you haven't restarted the parsers - I may be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure clicking \"save\" in Ambari does not deploy the new properties, and this is the reason I ask for a doc change. Previously, configuring pcap was all manual steps. Now it will be a combo of manual steps for start/stop, automated steps for the config updates. And more specifically for the config updates, you will *only* see them if you make them in Ambari and restart the parsers. Also, if you choose not to use Ambari for this config handling and instead make your config changes to pcap.properties locally, you will have to remember that restarting the parsers will overwrite your pcap config - something you're only likely to realize the next time you start/restart pcap. This is the behavior that I think we should document if we accept this.

Putting the individual pcap queries into separate tests makes it easier to understand when things go wrong.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to move the pcap job/query related code to it's own test?  For me it makes more sense to have these tests in something like PcapJobIntegrationTest in metron-pcap.  It feels awkward for the pcap topology test to be in a setup or `@BeforeClass` method.  If I introduced a bug to the pcap topology code, which test would fail?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411162415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411164194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1134#issuecomment-411164194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1134","id":411164194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTE2NDE5NA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T18:56:10Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T18:56:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just FYI, this work was already done in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1019.

Prior to this refactoring, only 1 test would fail if a bug was introduced, and likely only the first test. This test is, and has been, a 2-phase broad e2e/acceptance test since the beginning. I didn't seek to change the fundamental operation of the test in this refactoring, but rather the organization of those units to make it easier to pinpoint specific failures. I definitely see your point about the setup, though this is still a definite improvement imo that moves us in the direction of being able to make additional refactorings should we so choose.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question more broadly, I've dealt with similar questions when testing DAO layers with databases. The approach I've used in the past that yielded optimal results without duplicating almost verbatim the code under test and test code itself was to use the code under test to read/write to the system and verify the expected values. To your point, however, this test is really 2 phases. \r\n1. `Raw pcap -> pcap topology processes it -> pcap as sequence files in HDFS`\r\n2. `pcap as sequence files in HDFS -> pcap query filters it -> written to local  FS or HDFS`\r\n\r\nEach of those can be tested independently, similar to what I described about DAO's. Even so, I think there's probably value in doing the full e2e as it's currently being done since we also have some spot-check unit tests around the individual components as well. We could spin up a test for the pcaptopology distinct from the querying, but there's definitely more work there. We would need\r\nto:\r\n1. write test code that correctly reads the sequence files from HDFS\r\n2. choose additional test conditions for the topology validation (e.g. validating specific pcap values)\r\n3. create a sequence file (probably just pulled from the output of the existing integration test after the topology creates the files in HDFS) for input to the query test.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, could I convince you that the improvements made by this PR are a good first step that moves us closer to additional improvements should we choose to make them?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411181505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411182307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1143#issuecomment-411182307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1143","id":411182307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTE4MjMwNw==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T19:58:59Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T19:58:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please change the title to \"METRON-1713: PCAP UI - Add a way to kill a pcap job\" to match https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1713","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411182307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411185742","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1140#issuecomment-411185742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1140","id":411185742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTE4NTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-07T20:10:05Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T20:10:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's fine with me.

I think there's more nuance here.  When I do a kill a job in the middle of submission, what happens is it kicks off a kill that fails still:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"timestamp\":\"2018-08-07 22:12:29\",\"status\":405,\"error\":\"Method Not Allowed\",\"message\":\"Request method 'DELETE' not supported\",\"path\":\"/api/v1/pcap/kill/\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe job still kicks off (which doesn't terribly surprise me, since it's async).  At that point, the progress bar has disappeared, but you can't kick off another job (it'll throw an error since you're already running a job).\r\n\r\nIt seems like something like this (and feel free to throw out more ideas) would be ncie:\r\n1. The UI indicates cancellation of submitted job is in progress. E.g. the progress bar or something similar to how error messages are displayed says \"Cancellation in progress\". I'm not really sure what the best way to to it is.\r\n2. The call to create a job waits until it gets back it's job id.  It then calls kill on the returned job.  That way we aren't running the job in the background and locking the user out.\r\n3. After cancellation of the submitting job, the user is again free to submit a new job.  They're only locked out for the duration of the cancellation, not until job completion.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411416393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411509214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1134#issuecomment-411509214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1134","id":411509214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTUwOTIxNA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T18:38:39Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T18:38:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anandsubbu @MohanDV - if we set this to metron:hadoop will that cover both cases?
