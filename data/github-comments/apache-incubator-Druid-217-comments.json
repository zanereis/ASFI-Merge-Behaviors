the new UI serves cluster management, data management, and sql query interface, so I think the router is a good place to add since it's already working as a proxy for overlords, coordinators, and brokers. So, as @jon-wei commented, we can promote it to a unified access point for a Druid cluster. \r\n\r\nBut, I agree that it's not good to make the router mandatory. To avoid that, we can add a new configuration to some module, so that one of mandatory modules can work as a proxy instead. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's the best place to add this configuration to though. From the implementation side, maybe the broker is a good place since it already has a heavy dependency on the coordinator: it gets info about all published & used segments for system table from the coordinator. The coordinator also has some dependencies on the overlord, but they're small.

I'm referring to this line in `LongSumVectorAggregator`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal long[] vector = selector.getLongVector();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, depending on compression, encoding and so on, it may be faster to read only a small subset of rows from the underlying columnar storage, rather than the full batch. For example, reading the entire batch may involve decompressing an extra block that doesn't even contain any of the rows that the aggregator needs. But the current design of `VectorValueSelector` doesn't allow aggregators to take advantage of that finer-grained access. Do you think that we should consider amending the vectorization design to enable that?\r\n\r\nBTW, let me know if you'd like to take this discussion to #6794 instead, since it's starting to sound like a more general discussion of the vectorization system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457073251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457109067","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6904#issuecomment-457109067","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6904","id":457109067,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzEwOTA2Nw==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T08:27:17Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T08:27:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the review and benchmarks @asdf2014 :+1:, switched to use `java.util.Base64` and adjusted the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457109067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457110218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6397#issuecomment-457110218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6397","id":457110218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzExMDIxOA==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T08:31:24Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T08:31:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@leventov would you mind if I merge this soon so I can unblock another branch I'm sitting on that adds sql support on top of this?

This makes Hadoop style indexing have problems because all of the libs get jumbled together when the hadoop jobs are run.\r\n\r\nHere is a rough example of the module I'm hoping can be in stock druid:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\npublic class GcpModule implements DruidModule\r\n{\r\n  @Override\r\n  public List<? extends Module> getJacksonModules()\r\n  {\r\n    return ImmutableList.of();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void configure(Binder binder)\r\n  {\r\n    // NOOP\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  @Provides\r\n  @LazySingleton\r\n  public HttpRequestInitializer getHttpRequestInitializer(\r\n      HttpTransport transport,\r\n      JsonFactory factory\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    try {\r\n      return GoogleCredential\r\n          .getApplicationDefault(transport, factory)\r\n          .createScoped(Collections.singleton(\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform\"));\r\n    }\r\n    catch (IOException e) {\r\n      throw new RuntimeException(\"Unable to build authentication\", e);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Provides\r\n  @LazySingleton\r\n  public HttpTransport getHttpTransport()\r\n  {\r\n    return new NetHttpTransport.Builder()\r\n        .build();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Provides\r\n  @LazySingleton\r\n  public JsonFactory getJsonFactory()\r\n  {\r\n    return JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow the GCP api client, which has transitive guava and jackson dependencies, to be controlled at the master pom level rather than having their lib versions buried down in the extension. That makes guava and jackson version conflicts easier to manage, and allows extensions in house to not have to load the same jars multiple times.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457410561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457410832","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6910#issuecomment-457410832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6910","id":457410832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzQxMDgzMg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T00:32:02Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T00:32:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For

I don't think we are replacing the old UIs with the new one in this proposal. People can still use the old ones if they prefer, so we don't have to ensure that right now.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we may want to choose one of them as default. The new UI combines data from multiple sources (coordinator, overlord, and broker enabled SQL) and shows them together. I think this would be really useful for users but it introduces some new requirements (enabling SQL) and dependencies (between the node running the UI and coordinator, overlord, and broker). IMO, this is a sort of trade-off and it's worth to pay the price. Unlike HDFS and Yarn, Druid's indexing, storage, and querying system are tightly coupled with each other, and so it would be really useful for debugging if we can see those information in one page.\r\n\r\nFYI, when SQL is enabled, the broker starts `DataSchema` which periodically gathers segment information from historicals by executing `SegmentMetadataQuery`. This may be quite expensive, but is inevitable if we want to show this information in the UI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457786734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457787830","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6912#issuecomment-457787830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6912","id":457787830,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Nzc4NzgzMA==","user":{"login":"glasser","id":16724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser","html_url":"https://github.com/glasser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glasser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-26T01:23:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-26T01:23:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, I missed that because I wasn't looking at the non-tasklog files!

We can't force regressions on Druid users, even on a small subset of queries (correct me if I'm wrong here, but given Druid's maturity and production use, that seems reasonable).\r\n> 4. This means we need to let users override which strategy to use, so they can at least maintain the previous performance.\r\n> 5. Ideally, we would also have an \"auto\" strategy, which @clintropolis is working on; but we still need the manual override unless that strategy is always right (see point 3).\r\n> \r\n> Is that correct?\r\n\r\n1 & 2 are definitely correct. 3 & 4 are ideals we try to hold ourselves to whenever possible. Sometimes offering options to preserve old behavior isn't feasible for some reason -- maybe the old and new behavior cannot both exist due to a fundamental incompatibility. How to handle that kind of thing tends to be case by case. 5 accurately reflects my opinion at least :)\r\n\r\n> If I understand correctly, depending on compression, encoding and so on, it may be faster to read only a small subset of rows from the underlying columnar storage, rather than the full batch. For example, reading the entire batch may involve decompressing an extra block that doesn't even contain any of the rows that the aggregator needs. But the current design of VectorValueSelector doesn't allow aggregators to take advantage of that finer-grained access. Do you think that we should consider amending the vectorization design to enable that?\r\n\r\nThat's true. In general it's best if we only read what we need. One tricky thing here happens with a query like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  SUM(x) FILTER(WHERE y = 1) as agg1\r\n  SUM(x) FILTER(WHERE y = 2) as agg2\r\nFROM tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `y = 1 OR y = 2` accounts for a high proportion of rows, then the current approach of #6974 works well. It avoids wasting time building separate partial vectors of `x` for each aggregator. But if `y = 1 OR y = 2` accounts for a small proportion of rows, it doesn't work as well. You'd probably prefer to either generate separate masked `x` vectors for each aggregator, or somehow `OR` together all the filters that apply to things reading from `x` and then use that when reading the `x` column. Either approach would definitely need to involve some rework of the APIs.\r\n\r\n> BTW, let me know if you'd like to take this discussion to #6794 instead, since it's starting to sound like a more general discussion of the vectorization system.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think so -- if you reply to vectorization-specific stuff then let's do it over there. (But keep the discussion about harmonizing filtered aggregators & query-level filters, here, I think, assuming they don't become too intertwined.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457957276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/457963331","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6915#issuecomment-457963331","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6915","id":457963331,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Nzk2MzMzMQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-27T23:12:32Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T23:12:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe we could add some verification step to `distribution` that runs something like this and makes sure we don't have two copies of any jars that appear in `lib`.
