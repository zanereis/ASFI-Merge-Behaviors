Could you provided a test report for verification ?\r\n\r\nBesides, I was concerned by if this upgrade will break current functions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/809967113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/809999405","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1558#issuecomment-809999405","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1558","id":809999405,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwOTk5OTQwNQ==","user":{"login":"liusheng","id":5335434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzU0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5335434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liusheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liusheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T07:51:00Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T08:17:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @hit-lacus ,\r\nThanks for your reply. yes, we are aim to promoting some popular open source projects support running on ARM platform. for Kylin, I have verified the building, and runing all tests(seems also includes integration tests), if needed, I will verified the deployment and basic functionalities of Kylin on ARM64 server ans post testing reports.\r\n\r\nFor the upgrade of rocksdbjni from version `5.9.2`~`5.18.4`, I wil also try to check if there is side effect,  rocksdb multi-arch support and version upgrade has already be performed on Kafka/Storm/Flink[1][2][3].\r\n\r\nThe Rocksdb adds Arm64 support [4] since version 6.4.6, and also backports all Arm64\r\nrelated commits to 5.18.4 and release a all platforms support version.\r\n\r\nSo, from multi-arch support view, the better rocksdb version is the version since\r\nv6.4.6, or 5.X version is v5.18.4.\r\n\r\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3599\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8284\r\n[3] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13598\r\n[4] https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/6250  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/809999405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/810037184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1558#issuecomment-810037184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1558","id":810037184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDAzNzE4NA==","user":{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T08:44:57Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T08:44:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One of your commit 's commit message is \"Use openjdk11 for ARM64 test\", did your patch use openjdk11 for test?

Firstly, the dingding sdk's license is unknown, so it is not okya for Kylin to bundle it in the release. Secondly, the notification module can be designed as pluggable. For example, user can implement an interface and then config the implementation class in kylin.properties. Kylin then will load the class at runtime by name, and then send the notification.
