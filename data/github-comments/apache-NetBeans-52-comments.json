Perhaps you can compensate for thinness by making sure the line fills the entire device pixel width available to the icon. Compare for instance with the \"minimize\" button shown on Windows 10 on the top-right corner of any OS-painted window.\r\n\r\nIt still looks vertically misaligned next to the X--it should be like an underscore, not a hyphen (so \"X _\", not \"X -\").\r\n\r\nOn the editor tab height discussion: Most screens are widescreen these days, which means vertical space is at a real premium. A Retina MacBook Pro with a 2560x1600 device pixel resolution effectively ends up having only 800 logical pixels available in the vertical direction--30% _less_ than than the laptop I had back in 2004! For this reason I would encourage keeping things tight in the vertical direction, at least in the editor area.\r\n\r\nOn the tab border discussion: The hover effect is nice, but how does the user know where to aim the mouse when moving it towards a tab? It's not clear where the boundary between one tab and the next is. And in the editor tabs, when there are 3-4 adjacent non-selected tabs open, it will not be immediately visually clear whether the \"X\" belongs to the tab to the left or the right.\r\n\r\nIn the screenshots on https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf, the borderless tab works well, because each tab is only a text component. I think the presence of an X button and an icon for each tab makes the borderless approach less feasible. You could add more horizontal space between the tabs, but that would decrease the number of tabs the user can see at once (and I, for one, frequently have 15-20 tabs open). I'd prefer a thin, subtle border between the tabs, and a darker background color for any tabless remaining area to the right.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/565105696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/565125031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1771#issuecomment-565125031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1771","id":565125031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTEyNTAzMQ==","user":{"login":"DevCharly","id":5604048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly","html_url":"https://github.com/DevCharly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DevCharly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T18:21:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T18:21:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lkishalmi +1 on merging\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/565125031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/565167389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1771#issuecomment-565167389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1771","id":565167389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTE2NzM4OQ==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T20:13:23Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T20:13:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please don't merge like this.

@mglukhikh ,\r\n\r\nWe could find no CCLA or SGA from JetBrains.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of IP clearance is to make sure that the owners of any IP explicitly grant Apache the rights needed to modify and redistribute the material.\r\n\r\nIf JetBrains owns all of the IP, then a CCLA or SGA is usually needed. \r\n- The SGA is typically used if it is a one-time grant. \r\n- The CCLA is typically used if there will be continuing grants done by employees (named in the CCLA). \r\n\r\nWhere there is a small number of people who wrote all of the material, even if the IP is owned by their employer, then having each of them submit an ICLA (which states in section 4 that they have permission of the IP owner to contribute) will suffice. If there are other IP owners of material here, we need another discussion.\r\n\r\nTo make forward progress, it might be useful for JetBrains to create a new repository containing only the material that they are granting to Apache.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact the NetBeans PMC with any questions at private@netbeans.apache.org.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAntonio","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/568888325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/568920587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1815#issuecomment-568920587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1815","id":568920587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODkyMDU4Nw==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-25T18:20:08Z","updated_at":"2019-12-25T18:20:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.
