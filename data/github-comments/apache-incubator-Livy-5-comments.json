I could make it more explicitly fail at decoding like is already done for the `kind` key if you are interested in that :)\r\n\r\nAs for how this will impact other modes, I did some digging through the Spark code I think the answer is \"not much\". On the submit side, all CLI parsing into the SparkConf is handled purely as strings. The only type checks come when retrieving values from the conf, so as long as you don't actually use a fractional core value with YARN, it should be fine (technically if you tried to assign more than 2<sup>53</sup> cores it would cause a problem because that can't be represented in a double with exact precision, but I think we're probably okay on that one). Local mode actually ignores the values entirely and will happily accept `--executor-cores banana`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/360937364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/361435760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/74#issuecomment-361435760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/74","id":361435760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTQzNTc2MA==","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-30T00:35:04Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T00:35:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the updates.
