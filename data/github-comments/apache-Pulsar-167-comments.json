The requirement is coming from Flink connector. We need to read a sub-stream (a range) from a given message id. This should be pretty straightforward to add since a reader is an exclusive non-durable subscription. So we can just seek to the provided message id and filter the messages based on the key/value.\r\n\r\n@yjshen can chime in for more requirements for Flink connector.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558342703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558343043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5680#issuecomment-558343043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5680","id":558343043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODM0MzA0Mw==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T21:15:14Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T21:15:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run java8 tests\r\nrun cpp tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558343043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558344094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5660#issuecomment-558344094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5660","id":558344094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODM0NDA5NA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T21:17:59Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T21:17:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tuteng can you regenerate the api documents?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558344094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558347015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5624#issuecomment-558347015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5624","id":558347015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODM0NzAxNQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T21:25:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T21:25:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The approach still has a couple of problems.\r\n\r\n1) it only works if you run function worker as part of broker or as separate process.

Do you have a precise scenario for this to happen?\r\n\r\n>> @sijie \r\ncreate a topic with 20 partitions. with parallelism == 20. The producer setting in the pulsar sink is the default producer setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave a try with similar setup and  somehow I couldn't reproduce it. and reason broker doesn't go OOM because I think what @merlimat mentioned. Broker restricts max pending publish request per connection.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/ServerCnx.java#L130\r\n\r\nalso, introducing counter across all topics for throttling can cause bottleneck while publishing for all topics so, this feature might not be recommended for most of the users.\r\n\r\nso, I would recommend to depend on maxPendingRequestPerConnection rather adding more complexity and if that's not working then it's worth to investigate why it disabling channel still cause OOM.

(think about the peak traffic in China's shopping festival day).\r\n\r\nThe requirement from us is deadly simple - I have a broker, no matter how many clients send the request and how clients batch the request, broker should work as normal and give backpressure to the client when exceed the capacity that a broker offers. The ideal perfect solution is to disable auto-read when the resource usage (aka memory usage, cpu usage, or network usage) exceed a threshold and the process should be done automatically. However to achieve a perfect solution like that takes time and is usually complicated.  The closest solution that we can provide is to have a broker-level rate limiter : 1) we can limit the traffic based on an aggregate throughput (bytes/second); 2) the mechanism is already available by #3985, we just piggyback.

If people doesn't need this feature, they don't have to turn on broker-level rate limiting.\r\n2) If current counter is a bottleneck, we can seek for an improved method to improve counting. e.g. a better counter implementation.\r\n\r\nThe question here is more about: do we need a broker-level mechanism to meet the requirements of running Pulsar at high load? If we need, then why not adopt the rate limiter approach? If we don't, then what are the other approaches?
