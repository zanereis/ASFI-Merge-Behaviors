Suppose I start a transaction, which times out, and therefore goes into the invalid list. A little later HBase performs a major compaction. This transaction and all its writes are removed from the table by the DataJanitor. A little later TxManager prunes its invalid transactions, and because this tx has been removed from HBase, it removes it from the invalid list. \n\nThe problem is if the program that started the transaction is still running. What if it performs another write after the transaction pruning? This would be an invalid version, but now it has been pruned from the invalid list and becomes visible. \n\nIsn't that a problem?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix-tephra/issues/comments/258645956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix-tephra/issues/comments/258995982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix-tephra/pull/19#issuecomment-258995982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix-tephra/issues/19","id":258995982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1ODk5NTk4Mg==","user":{"login":"poornachandra","id":3181212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODEyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3181212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra","html_url":"https://github.com/poornachandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-07T23:22:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T23:22:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anew One way to handle the above issue is to define a time limit that defines a maximum duration a transaction can be used for writing.

Emitting metrics - metrics are emitted every 10 seconds\r\n\r\n3. getInvalidSize() - called when Thrift endpoint is invoked by user or by monitoring scripts\r\n\r\n4. and 5. getExcludedListSize() and logStatistics() - these methods are used in test or unused\r\n\r\nThe only significant usage is by canCommit() when the committing transaction is not in the in-progress list. I think this overhead is acceptable since we now sort the invalid list only when creating a transaction, as opposed to sorting it whenever the list changed (like we did earlier).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix-tephra/issues/comments/281238607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix-tephra/issues/comments/281238649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix-tephra/pull/37#issuecomment-281238649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix-tephra/issues/37","id":281238649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTIzODY0OQ==","user":{"login":"poornachandra","id":3181212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODEyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3181212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra","html_url":"https://github.com/poornachandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/poornachandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T03:55:04Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T03:55:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@anew
