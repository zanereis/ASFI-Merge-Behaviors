In that case(such as upgrade versions) the proposal makes sense to me. Just curious do you know that we can leave the cluster for debugging if the e2e failed to run the commands (failed to setup the env)? In another word the e2e can be configured not to destroy the cluster if it failed to run the setup commands.

I have some rough ideas about the design of API and also some problems:\r\n1. For the span creating, I would like to use the annotation @LocalSpan, @EntrySpan, @ExitSpan like the trace annotation in apm-toolkit-trace.\r\n2. For the inject/extract for RPC tracing, I think they respectively correspond to the @ExitSpan and @EntrySpan, but I have no idea about how to pass the contextCarrier.\r\n3. For the capture/continued function, I think the api in apm-toolkit-trace is wonderful, maybe we can just use the similar way? Or I think the exposure of capture() and continued() which can be used before and after entering the thread may be another way.\r\n4. For tag and log for the current span, I would like to use the same functions' design log() and tag() in abstractTracingSpan, of course, the activation is as the link.\r\n5. For Async prepare/finish, I think the functions' design of prepareForAsync() and asyncFinish() in AbstractTracingSpan can be used, but I have no idea about how to guarantee that these two operations correspond to one span?\r\n\r\nI hope this will be my good first issue in apache-skywalking community. And it would be nice if you could offer some suggestions on my ideas.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1372204509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1372336291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9999#issuecomment-1372336291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9999","id":1372336291,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85RzDCj","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T15:07:04Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T15:07:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"When I wrote this issue, I didn't expect to add more annotations.

Now I'm writing the code of the outer API first, but I encounter some problems:\r\n* First is the `SpanRef` how to point to the real span, the method I think is embedding a real span attribute `span` into the `SpanRef` object. WDYT?\r\n* Then we should import the `AsyncSpan` class into the `SpanRef` class. Is it allowed to import internal packages like this? Also for the `ContextSnapshot` imported into the `Tracer` class for `capture` and `continued` methods.\r\n* And for the `SpanRef` idea, I want to merge `AsyncSpanRef` and `SpanRef` proposed originally into the `SpanRef` showing as below codes.
