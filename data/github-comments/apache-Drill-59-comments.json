To summarize, when we run a Drillbit, patching occurs. This means that any test that starts a Drillbit should *not* need to patch. In fact, we probably *do not want* to patch: we need the tests to verify that the Drillbit does any needed patching on its own.\r\n\r\nWe have tests that do not start a Drillbit; these tend to test specific bits of the system. Such tests should not need patching unless they pull in one of the affected dependencies. In this case, it makes sense for the test to explicitly declare that it needs patching so we can verify that the dependency works as needed.\r\n\r\nFrom this, we get the following suggestion:\r\n\r\n* Any test that derives from `BaseTestQuery` or `ClusterTest` will start a Drillbit. So the test *should not* attempt to patch as doing so will hide any Drillbit patching errors.\r\n* Any other test should optionally invoke patching if needed for the specific item under test. (For example, if we have HBase, MapR or other tests that do unit tests without a Drillbit.) In this case, part of the test is to verify that the patching works for that dependency.\r\n\r\nA result of this thinking is that we *should not* create a new base test class that always does patching. \r\n\r\nI wonder, how does the result above differ from what we already do?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560512155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560518278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1910#issuecomment-560518278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1910","id":560518278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDUxODI3OA==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T18:22:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T18:22:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, your suggestion sounds reasonable to me, but one more thing should be mentioned - is that we use guava in test classes also, so there are possible cases when class is loaded before Drill is patched, and therefore patching is failed.

Doing the patching in a static block makes sense; that ensures the patching is done early (though it still depends on when the class is loaded.)\r\n\r\nPutting the patching in a test base class solves the ordering issue: the static block will be invoked before any other code in the test. However, the problem with a base class is we'd need a common base class for all tests, as was done in this PR. This means that we then mask the Drillbit patching, which, as explained earlier, we don't want to do.\r\n\r\nI wonder, can we define an interface to solve the problem? Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface RequiresGuavaPatch {\r\n  GuavaPatcher PATCHER = new GuavaPatcher();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class MyTest implements RequiresGuavaPatch {\r\n ...\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAssuming that creating the patcher does the patches. Else, we can create a specialized \"shim\" class that does patching in its constructor.\r\n\r\nThis approach hides the details of patching, yet declares that the test does require patching. Only non-Drillbit tests need worry about this interface. And, only tests that have affected dependencies need implement the interface.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to be more specific, `HBaseTest`, `MapRTest` and so on that do whatever patching is needed just for that dependency. As these dependencies upgrade their own dependencies, we can change the code behind, say, `MapRTest` to remove patching no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThis way, we track patching at the dependency level, rather than as a single global (and thus hard-to-understand) task.\r\n\r\nLet me clarify that point a bit. We need to patch due to specific transitive dependencies. As those are removed, we should remove patches. If we know that such-and-so patching is needed for each dependency, we can track when that patching is no longer needed. If patching is just done globally, then we have no good way to know why we do each patch, and when it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nWould something like this solve the problem?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560539390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560573022","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1915#issuecomment-560573022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1915","id":560573022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDU3MzAyMg==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T20:45:13Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T20:45:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, LGTM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560573022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560639306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1910#issuecomment-560639306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1910","id":560639306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDYzOTMwNg==","user":{"login":"agozhiy","id":31588230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31588230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy","html_url":"https://github.com/agozhiy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agozhiy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T21:43:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T21:43:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, the approach you suggested is reasonable and actually it is similar to the one used in Drill now. But it doesn't solve the original issue. Let me describe it:\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites:**\r\n- In java-exec module we have both tests that require patching (or use Drillbit) and standalone tests that don't need patching but might use some Guava classes (e.g. Closeables)\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n1. Run tests by command:\r\n`mvn clean test -pl exec/java-exec -DforkCount=4`\r\nChanging forkCount is needed to increase probability of race conditions.\r\n2. Wait for failures.\r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\nTests are passed.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:**\r\nSome tests will fail because patching didn't happen.\r\n\r\nSo, let's see what is happening here:\r\nAs we cannot guarantee the tests execution order, it is quite possible that a test that doesn't init patching will run first. It is also possible that this test is using some Guava class inside (and it'll be loaded during the test execution). Once the class is loaded it cannot be patched (Javassist constructs a modified class, attempts to load it and fail with error \"attempted  duplicate class definition for name\"). Then, all patching-dependent tests will fail. I hope my explanation is clear.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Thank you for the feedback!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560639306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560733231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1910#issuecomment-560733231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1910","id":560733231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDczMzIzMQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T22:17:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T22:17:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@agozhiy, thank you, the explanation is crystal clear. In fact, I think I've been seeing a similar issue with the ZK and Dynamic UDF tests: they randomly fail about 75% of the time due to issues associated with loading/finding classes that appear to be generated on the fly.\r\n\r\nThe test solution might solve the above race conditions if all tests invoke the same patcher as their first task. We would have to assume that the Drillbit does also. But, even then, we *still* would not solve the problem. SqlLine runs, then loads any number of JDBC drivers (in the general case) followed by the Drill JDBC driver which can, if requested, start a Drillbit. We have little control over when patching is done in this case (unless we add patching to SqlLine startup.)\r\n\r\nGeneralizing, since any app can load the Drill JDBC driver and run Drill, *every* app would need the magic patcher run at startup. This seems like a solution that won't scale.\r\n\r\nWe're talking about patching at runtime. I wonder, can we patch at build time? Can we create a Drill-specific version of Guava with the patches applied, stored in a jar file?\r\n\r\nThis still does not help with third-party apps: they might put their own Guava on the class path before the patched Drill version.\r\n\r\nDid some Googling for solutions since we can't be the only folks with the problem. You've probably done the same. Here is a [note from the Guava team](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild) which recommends using Guava version 21.\r\n\r\n> In the simple case, just upgrade your project to the newest version of Guava. ... However, this can fail in some cases:\r\n>\r\n> *One of your dependencies uses a version of Guava from the days when we were still removing non-@Beta APIs.\r\n>\r\n> In these cases, you may be able to find an older version of Guava that satisfies all your dependencies. However, the only general solution is for all projects to update to at least Guava 21...\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a [Java library compliance checker tool](https://github.com/lvc/japi-compliance-checker) that might help identify actual gaps.\r\n\r\nIt also seems that that the only real solution that folks mention is [shading](https://bryantsai.com/how-to-resolve-dependency-conflict-out-of-your-control-e75ace79e54f). Can we shade the MapR plugin along with its dependent obsolete Guava version?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the only reliable solution is to get the set of dependencies to use compatible Guava versions. Can we upgrade our Hive/Hadoop dependencies to newer versions that depend on recent Guava versions? \r\n\r\nLook at it from the point of view of MapR and Hadoop: they cannot expect their clients to be on an ancient version of Guava; to support their users (including Drill), they have to stay current. Perhaps a bit of lobbying, searching will solve the problem without patching?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/560733231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/561111801","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1910#issuecomment-561111801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1910","id":561111801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTExMTgwMQ==","user":{"login":"vvysotskyi","id":20928429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI4NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20928429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/vvysotskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvysotskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-03T10:48:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-03T10:48:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, all these approaches require a large amount of time.

I had a nice unit test that I used when debugging. However, it turns out that we can't use it in Maven: the information in the system table ('connections') changes too much. (One row for one connection when run in the IDE, but 9 (?) rows when run in Maven.)\r\n\r\nI can perhaps add a different test: the problem should appear anytime a `LIMIT` is done where the limit amount is the same as the row count. But, to create such a test, I'll need to do it on master before this fix (to verify that the test catches the error.)\r\n\r\nEven better, this PR does include a new batch check that *did* catch the error. If the error occurs, all offsets in a VARCHAR offset vector will be 0. A check verifies that the largest offset is the same size as the data vector. If this bug occurs, that check will trigger and we'll see an error.

Looks like this PR is trying to solve two problems:\r\n\r\n1. Provide a standard template for PR messages,\r\n2. Provide a checklist of things we want the contributer to do.\r\n\r\nI wonder, should we think about the *commit* message; the one that will travel with the code in Git?\r\n\r\nFor the commit message, a simple template would be helpful:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDRILL-XXXX: Summary\r\n\r\nDescription of change.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have seen folks include only the bug number. (Of course, I'm not sure anyone ever reads the commit messages...)\r\n\r\nFor the PR message, do we insist people keep our headings? Only our headings? Should they replace the commit message with a differently worded message? That is, do we want people to describe the change twice, in two different ways?\r\n\r\nEach time I've seen shops provide these templates, it ends up that either the templates are off the mark, or they grow to be cumbersome. They are no substitute for people just doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nA good reviewer will look for tests (I do that first.) A `pom.xml` file change should be carefully reviewed.

However there are several places where the type of the column is required (min/max values, for example.)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that each column has multiple stats: some are of the same type as the column (min, max, histogram), others are not (HLL, NDV.)\r\n\r\nEven those that are the \"same\" type as the column are not: the column is of type `VARCHAR`, but the `ColumnStatistics` is of type `String`, say. There is no mapping from Drill to Java types; this knowedge appears to be implicit in the code.\r\n\r\nFurther, the `ColumnStatisticsKind` is not what you would think: it has a compile-time type (the type parameter), but, because of type erasure, no runtime type (I cannot ask what kind of value the kind holds.)\r\n\r\nI think we need to rethink this a bit:\r\n\r\n* A type definition holds the type-specific logic (such as merging stats) as well as giving both the Java and SQL type (if any) for the stat.\r\n* A mapping tells us the Java stats type for the SQL type.\r\n* A stats definition holds a name and a type definition.

Compile-time typing is a hindrance here; we need run-time typing.\r\n* Specific: compute or obtain a specific value of a specific type. The NDV, say, to be used in estimating selectivity.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to go from specific to generic:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  int foo = ...;\r\n  metadata.setValue(foo);\r\n...\r\n  public void setValue(Object value) {\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf is harder to go the other way. If we know the value is an `int`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  int foo = metadata.getInt();\r\n  // Or, less ideally:\r\n  assert metadata.getType() == MinorType.INT;\r\n  int foo = (Int) metadata.getValue();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `getInt()` just does in a method what the second example does inline.\r\n\r\nTo be type aware for all types:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  switch(metadata.getType()) {\r\n    case INT:\r\n      int intFoo = (Int) metadata.getValue();\r\n      ...\r\n    case VARCHAR:\r\n      String strFoo = (String) metadata.getValue();\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above is true if we introduce, say a `ValueHolder<T>` that holds a value of type T.

I think your idea is right. The question is, how do we achieve extensibility? This is a very complex subject to discuss via written form, but I'll try. I'm sure I'll miss something obvious.\r\n\r\nAny metastore can add its own metadata fields (`min`, `max`, `myOwnMetric`), etc. When that happens, the rest of Drill should *not* change. So, adding a class to a class hierarchy that Drill must understand may not be the way to go. Instead, we have to identify the parts that are fixed by Drill and the parts that the specific metastore can extend.\r\n\r\nLet's take our list of metadata \"fields.\" Drill defines `min` and `max`: I as a metastore author need to honor Drill's definition. (Or, I need to tell that I can't report `min` and `max`, but I can report, say, `NDV` because I'm Hive.) On the other hand, `myOwnMetric` is something I define for use, perhaps, in my own WizzBang store plugin.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about a predicate visitor. For the code to compile in Drill, the visitor has to know about all possible predicates that can be visited; that's the only way to create the `visit(Foo)` methods in the base class.\r\n\r\nI like how you've categorized the predicates. (MUCH easier than using internal function names the way many plugins currently do.) (I might quibble and say that there are only four predicate types: Unary (IS NULL, IS TRUE, etc.), Binary (=, !=, etc.), Boolean (AND, OR) and List (IN).) Yes, Boolean predicates are binary, but they are \"special\" because, by definition, each of their two arguments is, itself, a predicate (or a Boolean literal.)\r\n\r\nSo, since Drill defines the predicates (they come from the SQL query), the types should be known to Drill.\r\n\r\nFor predicates derived from a SQL query, the argument types are also defined: Drill must have been able to parse them out of the SQL text and apply some type (at least Number, String, Boolean). And, predicates can be of mixed types: `10 = '10'` say. So, the predicate *result* is binary, but the arguments are of any type (even if they don't make sense as in my example.)\r\n\r\nWhat, then, can be extended? The underlying type of a column. (Maybe `INT96` in Parquet, or `IPAddress` in some security system.) My custom plugin has to convert between my values (`INT96`) and Drill's values. So, if we see `X = 123456`, our custom code might know that `X` is a column in our DB that is of type `INT96`, so we might then try to convert the Drill-type (`INT`, say) of `123456` into the `INT96` type for our push-down filter.\r\n\r\nIn stats, I might define `min` to be of my own specific `INT96` type. (That is, the `min` value is of the type of the actual data, not of the type that the reader will convert it to in Drill.)\r\n\r\nDrill's description of the min value must be generic, however. (Drill does not know about my type.) One way to do that is to add \"meta-meta-data\" that says that the value of this metadata field is my private `INT96` type. Only I know how to read those values; Drill treats them as `Object`s.\r\n\r\nIf something wanted to do a query on my metadata, my \"meta-meta-data\" could provide a `toString` method to convert the `INT96` `min` value to something that Drill can display.\r\n\r\nOh, one other topic to cover. Different systems provide different stats. Generally, a system provides NDV or a histogram (or nothing). This info exists, primarily, to compute selectivity for a filter. (How many values will `X = 10` match?) Where should this logic be? Generically in Drill? For equality:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  if (metadata == null) {\r\n    sel = 0.15;\r\n  } else if (metadata.get(\"histogram\") != null) {\r\n    sel = metadata.getHistorgramProbability(arg);\r\n   } else if (metadata.get(\"ndv\") != null) {\r\n    sel = 1 / metadata.get(\"ndv\");\r\n  } ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, we could make this more generic: require that the metadata provide a `computeSelectivity(arg)` method that \"does the right thing\" for the system in question with the metadata available. (A special \"dummy\" metadata provider could provide Calcite's default 0.15 guess.)\r\n\r\nIn short, this is a tricky topic. We have to think about what Drill does and what the extension does. Maybe we can move the discussion to another forum (maybe direct e-mail) so we don't spam the dev list. Then we can work through specific use cases so I can perhaps make more specific suggestions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/565248380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/565433401","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1931#issuecomment-565433401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1931","id":565433401,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTQzMzQwMQ==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T13:02:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T13:02:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@j-4

But... that's not for this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570093777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570163187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1946#issuecomment-570163187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1946","id":570163187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDE2MzE4Nw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T10:03:28Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T10:03:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, please squash the commits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570163187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570193523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1949#issuecomment-570193523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1949","id":570193523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDE5MzUyMw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T12:26:06Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T12:26:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1, LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570193523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570227893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1946#issuecomment-570227893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1946","id":570227893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDIyNzg5Mw==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T14:43:50Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T14:43:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @arina-ielchiieva for the review.

Here is my general philosophy on refactoring: do it in bite-size chunks. The first step here was simply to break code gen out of the operator itself. By leaving the bulk of the code unchanged, one can do a review by diffing the old and new files (not in GitHub, sadly), and see that blocks of code are identical, they have just been moved; in some cases from one huge function to smaller functions. Then, once we're satisfied that this simple refactoring works, we can think about the next step.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with the step-by-step approach, then perhaps we can commit this first step to put us in position to make subsequent changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570465320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570465345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1944#issuecomment-570465345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1944","id":570465345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDQ2NTM0NQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T05:16:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T05:16:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\nLonger term, it seems we might want to restructure how we generate code. Today, if we run a query across, say, 20 minor fragments in the same Drillbit, and they all see the same schema (the normal case), then all 20 will generate exactly the same code. Then, down in the compiler layer, the first thread will compile the code and put it into the code cache. Threads 2 through 20 will get the compiled code from the cache.\r\n\r\nBut, today, the process is **very** inefficient. Each thread:\r\n\r\n* Does the semantic expression analysis (function lookup, type resolution, etc.)\r\n* Generate the entire Java code.\r\n* Rewrite the Java code to remove the varying bits (the generated class name).\r\n* Hash the entire code to get a hash code to look up in the code cache.\r\n* If a match is found, compare the entire code block byte-by-byte to verify a match.\r\n* If new, generate code, cache it, and use the source code (which can be huge) as the cache key.\r\n\r\nThe only real benefit of this approach is that it has worked all these years. \r\n\r\nThe better approach is to:\r\n\r\n* Create a parameterized \"descriptor\" object that holds all the factors needed to generate the code. (Input schema, expressions, relevant session options.)\r\n* Use that descriptor as a key into the code lookup table. If found, reuse the compiled code without any code gen.\r\n* If not found, only then tell the descriptor to generate the needed code, which will then be shared by all fragments.\r\n\r\nThe work I did back in the managed sort, and that I'm starting here, at least splits code gen from the operator.\r\n\r\nI suspect one (very long term) improvement would be to introduce another layer of abstraction like we had in Impala. The code gen code tries to do the kind of logical type analysis normally done in a planner. But, because the goal is Java code gen, it tends to mix SQL type analysis with Java implementation details, leading to overly complex code. (That's what I'm fighting with the typeof/UNION issue.).\r\n\r\nSuch an approach would be doubly useful a we roll out the schema improvements your team has been doing. If we know the schema (types) at plan time, we can work out all the type conversion stuff at that time. In fact, we can even play the Spark trick: generate Java once in the planner and send it to the workers.\r\n\r\nI have only vague ideas here; have not spent much time on it. Sounds like you've looked at this some. What do you suggest we do?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/570465345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
