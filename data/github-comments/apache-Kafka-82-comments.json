I think I'm still missing something. Based on what you mentioned, it seems we would want to collect metrics at a higher level (at fetch response levels instead of `fetchedRecords`).\n\nIn your first comment I believe you were referring to [this `record()` call](https://github.com/vahidhashemian/kafka/blob/131f96868aa24f38f69ee2ab769ea3f289e5c1fc/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/Fetcher.java#L722) (as a member of `FetchResponseMetricAggregator`), and not the [call to `recordTopicFetchMetrics()`](https://github.com/vahidhashemian/kafka/blob/131f96868aa24f38f69ee2ab769ea3f289e5c1fc/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/internals/Fetcher.java#L556) which I thought was the culprit. That `record()` method doesn't seem to aggregate metrics per partition. It just aggregates across all partitions in the fetch response.

My interpretation of the topic-level fetch metrics is that they should be recording the per-topic number of records/bytes fetched from the entire fetch response rather than from each partition separately (does this seem correct?). That means we need to aggregate these stats by topic for each fetch response. The tricky thing is that we now parse the fetch data from each partition separately, so we need somewhere to store the stats so that they can be aggregated incrementally. That is the purpose of `FetchResponseMetricAggregator`. It contains a set of all the partitions that were contained in the fetch response and as we parse the data from each partition, we remove that partition from the set. Once all partitions have been parsed, we can record the fetch metrics. So my thought was that maybe we only needed to extend that idea. In addition to keeping the total number of bytes/records from the fetch response in `FetchResponseMetricAggregator`, we can also track the per-topic tallies. Would that make sense or not?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/236635565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/236646514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1685#issuecomment-236646514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1685","id":236646514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjY0NjUxNA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T17:20:22Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T17:20:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So after discussion of public API, this seems fine as long as we can address @ijuma's points.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/236646514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/236681433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1685#issuecomment-236681433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1685","id":236681433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjY4MTQzMw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-01T19:27:23Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T19:27:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It would be great to address the remaining points so that we can respin a new RC for 0.10.0.1.

And this behavior is actually by design with the following motivations:\n1. Originally we implement the punctuate function based on `processing time`, i.e. it will be scheduled based on the system's wall-clock time and hence the function will be triggered even if there is no data arrived after the elapsed amount of time.\n\nHowever one caveat of this semantics is that in bootstrapping, for example, when a day's data can be piped and processing within a few minutes (assuming the data traffic was not high), such `processing time driven punctuation` will have a problem as it is only based on elapsed wall-clock time.\n\nAnother example to think about if \"session windows\", as we are planning to add soon and to be implemented based on punctuate functions. In this case we should really trigger the function to expire a session, for example, based on `event time` but not on `processing time`.\n1. So as a result we moved into `event time` driven punctuation, that is we reason about the current stream time based on received records' timestamps and only trigger the function when that stream time has elapsed. And as you observed if there is no incoming data, stream time will not be advanced and hence no punctuation will be triggered, and on the other hand if events are coming much faster than `processing time` then multiple punctuations will be triggered.\n\nSo both semantics have their pros and cons, but I would like to hear your opinions and if you have a better solution regarding this aspect.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/237094287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/237133466","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1696#issuecomment-237133466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1696","id":237133466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzEzMzQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"rekhajoshm","id":5987836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODc4MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5987836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm","html_url":"https://github.com/rekhajoshm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rekhajoshm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T04:22:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T04:22:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

@guozhangwang !\n\nThanks for replying, and a level of details in answer!\n\nLet me start with a use-case I have and then I'll bring my thoughts on framework's design.\n\nMy goal is to create a system that will perform change data capture from MySQL, aggregate data accordingly to logical business transaction that performed actual insert/update/delete and pass it to event-sourcing kafka topic. CDC is covered by KafkaConnect/Debezium (works smoothly in prototype). The most challenging part is aggregation. MySQL schema is normalized, so one incoming data portion that represents one business transaction (may come as JSON/XML/etc document or user's submit from UI) may be split among 10 tables. There are all kinds of relations (one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many) and couple of nested levels of relations between those tables. The requirement is to aggregate data from all supplemental tables around record in main table and pack that all into one kafka message to send to event sourcing topic. \n\nInitially, kafka streams DSL was promising technology to use. But, during prototyping we've noticed following issues (main ones):\n\n**1)** KTable is not designed to be used for huge tables (billions of records). I realize that's not a framework gap and I agree with it's current design. Simple update (as a one business TX) of supplemental table doesn't trigger update of a main table (so there is no correspondent event in main table's topic with similar timestamp and stream-to-stream join won't work).\n**2)** Joins of more than two streams is questionable. I am not sure how sliding window will work in case if it will be used N-1 times for N joins. I didn't continue testing this approach though.\n**3)** Aggregation within one stream (one-to-many table case, where \"many\" records from related table have to be aggregated and become a part of one message) - aggregateByKey and reduceByKey don't have sliding window support (based on event's timestamp difference). It only uses system time to define window borders. \n\nThe biggest issue with above approach (even if all above issues haven't been existed) is that the flow from debezium topics to event sourcing topic becomes very long... with many processing/transition points (message transformations to proper keys for joins, multi-stage joins, separate topologies with processors, etc, etc). From support/monitoring/troubleshooting perspective it seems to be to complex and error-prone. \n\nAt this moment I consider global HBase storage for joins/aggregations with permanent store of all events (events are put to HBase by debezium topic's consumers). We already have HBase in place so it won't increase overall complexity. All joins/aggregates will be performed over data stored in HBase just by scanning supplemental/main records tables by key prefix in HBase table (very fast and scalable). Having global KV with ALL data in place brings many possibilities and strongest consistency guarantees.\n\nHere is actually how this pull-request was created :\n\nTo resolve 3rd issue from above list I tried to use processor's API and rely on punctuate function. Idea is very similar to how words count example works - process method adds value to a list and puts to KVStore under it's key. Punctuate method on a periodic basis iterates through KVStore, checks value's elements timestamps, aggregates them by earliest ts + window, sends aggregated value (if time window is expired) in one message to output topic and removes it from KVStore. And because of an issue that punctuate is not calling if there are no new events -- latest aggregate won't be sent until new record arrives. \n\nI believe that my case is enough to at least consider addition of additional (configurable) punctuation logic. What I mean is an ability to specify punctuation behavior in topology builder (overloaded method addProcessor with new parameter PunctuationMode.[WALL_CLOCK|STREAM_TIME], or smth like that). In my HBase-based design punctuation is implemented via tick topic (tick msg keeps a key that needs to be aggregated from HBase pieces and is sent with linger.ms option in producer close to window time to not saturate processing with ticks). \n\nAlso, another inconvenience that I noticed is that process method doesn't have event's time (one added in 0.10.0.0). So, in order to do any kinds of custom aggregations event's timestamp must be presented in event's value.\n\nI hope above has at least some sense.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/237395233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/237402695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1703#issuecomment-237402695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1703","id":237402695,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzQwMjY5NQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T23:07:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T23:07:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the PR.
