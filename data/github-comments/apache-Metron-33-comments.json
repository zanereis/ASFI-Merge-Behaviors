TESTING PLAN\r\n\r\nTesting Instructions beyond the normal smoke test (i.e. letting data\r\nflow through to the indices and checking them).\r\n\r\n# Preliminaries\r\n\r\nSince I will use the squid topology to pass data through in a controlled\r\nway, we must install squid and generate one point of data:\r\n* `yum install -y squid`\r\n* `service squid start`\r\n* `squidclient http://www.yahoo.com`\r\n\r\nAlso, set an environment variable to indicate `METRON_HOME`:\r\n* `export METRON_HOME=/usr/metron/0.4.0` \r\n\r\n# Deploy the squid parser\r\n* Create the squid kafka topic: `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic squid --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n* Start via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s squid`\r\n\r\n# Test Cases\r\n\r\n## Test Case 1: Base Case\r\n* Send squid data through: `cat /var/log/squid/access.log | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic squid`\r\n* Validate that the message goes through with no fields prefixed with `metadata`: `curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/squid*/_search?pretty'`\r\n\r\n## Test Case 2: Validate Environmental Metadata is available\r\n* Modify `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/squid.json` and turn on\r\n  metadata reading:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.GrokParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"squid\",\r\n  \"readMetadata\" : true,\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n

]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Persist config changes: `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n* Clear indices: `curl -XDELETE \"http://localhost:9200/squid*\"`\r\n* Send squid data through: `cat /var/log/squid/access.log | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic squid`\r\n* Validate that the message goes through with a `kafka_topic` field of `SQUID`: \r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/squid*/_search?pretty' -d '\r\n{\r\n  \"_source\" : [ \"kafka_topic\" ]\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n## Test Case 3: Validate Environmental Metadata is available and is able to be merged\r\n* Modify `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/squid.json` and turn on\r\n  metadata reading and merging:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.GrokParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"squid\",\r\n  \"readMetadata\" : true,\r\n

           }\r\n    }\r\n                           ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Persist config changes: `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n* Clear

\r\nWe're going to send a custom JSON Map containing metadata along in the key.  The map will have one value `customer_id`\r\n* Modify `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/squid.json` and turn on\r\n  metadata reading and turn off merging.

That way the site-book generator will be able to derive the site-book link text.\r\n\r\nThe trick is the generated tag text.  As noted in the fix-md-dialect.py script:\r\n```\r\nThe problem with generated tags is that Github-MD forces header text to lower-case, and\r\nreplaces blank spaces with hyphens, while doxia-markdown leaves case unchanged, and replaces\r\nblanks with underscores.  Fortunately we seem to have a culture of using link references that\r\nare typographically the same as the header text, so we have some basis for fixing most links.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for example, if you want to link to an h2 header \"This Is Great\" in file Mega.md, your Github-MD link tag will be \"\\<relative path\\>/Mega.md#this-is-great\", BUT the human-readable link text must also be \"This Is Great\", so that during site built we can magically generate the Doxia html link tag of \"\\<relative path\\>/Mega.html#This_Is_Great\".\r\n\r\nThis is only for auto-generated tags for headers and such.  If you are using hand-crafted html markup, with explicitly named tags, then you don't need to worry.  Use whatever link reference and anchor text you want, and the tag you defined.  If the link reference text doesn't look like the tag, then it won't try to auto-convert.

A couple of observations in no particular order of importance; just wanted to get this out there for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Considering the overhead\r\nI want to consider the overhead not in our tests for a moment.  In the last run, I count the following timings:\r\n* build - 5:41\r\n* unit tests - 2:59\r\n* integration tests - 14:44\r\n* metron-config - 2:17\r\n* verify licenses - 0:16\r\nThat's 25:57 out of a total run from Travis of 31:53, which is 5:56 overhead.\r\n\r\nWe should factor that in.\r\n\r\n# Where to Focus\r\n\r\n## Build Time\r\nThe natural conclusion is to focus on the long pole, those integration tests, but we may be served to also consider the build time.  Our build takes a long time and we depend upon parallelization to make the build return in a sensible time (the user time for the build is 26 minutes!).  Furthermore, our build is extremely IO heavy due to the shading that we (necessarily) do.  While we are on a shared system with the rest of the apache projects, I think reducing the IO burden of our build.\r\n\r\nWhile I think that shading is important, we have a very ham-fisted way of doing it.  We shade for two reasons:\r\n* Relocation of dependencies that conflict\r\n* Creating uber jars for Storm\r\n\r\nOne issue is that if we consider the tree of projects induced by their dependent nature, is that we shade non-leaf projects for purpose of relocation.  I propose we stop doing that.  Let's take, for instance, `metron-common`.  We shade that project to relocate guava and beanutils.  The consequences of relocating 2 packages is 47M of dependencies.  Those 47M of dependencies also gets bundled again into all of the leaf projects (e.g. `metron-parsers`, etc.), thus shading twice.\r\n\r\nI propose fixing this one of two ways:\r\n* aggressively exclude ALL dependencies other than `org.apache.metron` and the relocated dependencies in any project that needs shading purely for relocation\r\n* Extract the shaded/relocated dependencies across the project into a separate project and make all of our non-leaf dependencies non-shaded\r\n\r\nI think the first may be the easiest to achieve and most surgical.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it may even be advantageous to have a single jar created as the deployable output of our process (or maybe a small handful representing the independent subcomponents: `metron`, `MaaS` and `stellar`).\r\n\r\n## Integration Tests\r\nObviously the integration tests are the long pole in the tent.  A couple of thoughts on these:\r\n\r\n### `TaxiiIntegrationTest`\r\nMy impression was that it was slow because parsing taxii via the mitre library was downright arduous.  It costs us ~2:30 as of the working build above.\r\n\r\nWe are passing a relatively large blob of taxii in and should consider trimming the taxii example data down to something more manageable and see if that will drop the timing down.\r\n\r\n### `PcapIntegrationTest`\r\n\r\nWe currently test two modes for the PcapIntegrationTest, pulling the timestamp from the key and pulling the timestamp from the message itself.  We know that in production, we only want to support pulling the timestamp from the key.  We might cut this test time in half by only testing the supported approach (it's 81 seconds as of last count).\r\n\r\n### `Parser Integration Tests`\r\n\r\nWe might want to reconsider what we integration test here.  We currently have an integration test for every parser and we may get the same coverage by mocking out the `ParserWriterBolt` and constructing a shim to pass data in, execute against the real parser bolt, capture data written and evaluate the output.  This would drop the overhead for each parser test dramatically (no storm or kafka) and would keep the semantics of the tests.  Admittedly this may not be a focus in terms of bang-for-buck because total parser cost is around 86 seconds.\r\n\r\n# Reuse Integration Test Infrastructure\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the persistent conversation whenever our tests start to push us over the edge.  We incur quite a bit of overhead because we spin up and down integration test infrastructure in our `InMemoryComponent`s.  We could consider correcting this in a couple of ways:\r\n* Reusing the infrastructure\r\n  * Either use the in memory components or spin up light weight versions of the infrastructure and then run the tests against that (i.e. docker or separate-process versions of the in-memory components).\r\n  * We'd need to refactor each integration test to clean up after itself so other tests are not splashed\r\n* Parallelizing the Integration Tests\r\n  * Have the `InMemoryComponent`s be able to run in parallel\r\n  * This would require refactoring the components to seek for open ports and use them.\r\n\r\nThese are just my thoughts that I wanted to get out there and capture for review and comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/311320081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/311338450","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/530#issuecomment-311338450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/530","id":311338450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTMzODQ1MA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T12:07:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T12:07:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

I did another pass and found some trivial issues as well as a few non-trivial issues and have made comments.\r\n\r\nI think more thought needs to be put into the AlertService.search and AlertService.pollSearch functions.  The AlertService.getAlert function is very clear to me:  it requires a couple of clearly named parameters and I expect to get an 'Alert' type object back.  The other functions in this service are not as clear.  The search function for example takes in a QueryBuilder object which provides a generic javascript object as the body for the post request.  Then in return the post returns an Observable with a generic javascript object.  So essentially Typescript isn't being used here when it should because it would make the search interface clearer.\r\n\r\n For example, I would prefer this function signature:\r\n`public search(searchRequest: SearchRequest): Observable<SearchResponse>`\r\n\r\nwhere SearchRequest and SearchResponse are model objects.  The way it is now it's not easy to understand what is being sent and what is expected back unless you've spent time tracing the search calls to where requests are built/response are processed and know all the source code well OR already has a lot of experience with the ES query syntax.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is that not having a clear contract between the search client/server will make developing a middle-tier more tedious.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/311772571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/311851168","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/530#issuecomment-311851168","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/530","id":311851168,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTg1MTE2OA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-29T03:16:33Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T03:16:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have added deployment readme files to document where things get deployed to.\r\nThis if for the built in system parser extensions.

A search request could look like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": \"ip_src_addr:192.168.66.1\",\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 25,\r\n  \"sort\": [\r\n    { \"timestamp\": \"desc\"},\r\n    { \"some_other_field\": \"asc\"}\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere the query field is a lucene-style query (which is supported by both ES and Solr I believe).  A search response could look like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 10000,\r\n  \"results\":\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"1234abcd\",\r\n        \"score\": 1.0,\r\n        \"source\": {\r\n          \"source:type\": \"bro\",\r\n          \"host\": \"some host\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\"\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": \"5678efgh\",\r\n        \"score\": 1.0,\r\n        \"source\": {\r\n          \"source:type\": \"snort\",\r\n          \"ip_src_port\": 8080,\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can add other fields (aggregations for example) as we add more features.

removing the extra project element allows me to build the project now. However, I'm still unable to use the archetype. It neither shows up in the local catalog listing nor allows me to enter the info directly. It fails in both cases, even though the archetype is now appearing in `~/.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml`. Per the Maven docs for the archetype plugin, the entries should be in `~/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml`. - https://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin/specification/archetype-catalog.html.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I could do to get this working was to explicitly update the local catalog with the archetype plugin, which doesn't make any sense to me seeing as this is by default tied to the install goal in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 archetype-catalog.xml files locally with Maven and I'm unclear as to why. The only difference appears to be that 1) only ~/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml entries show up when you run `mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local` and 2) non-SNAPSHOT entries end up in `~/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml` whereas SNAPSHOT entries end up in `~/.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat ~/.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<archetype-catalog xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-archetype-plugin/archetype-catalog/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/archetype-catalog-1.0.0.xsd\"\r\n    xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-archetype-plugin/archetype-catalog/1.0.0\"\r\n    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\r\n  <archetypes>\r\n    <archetype>\r\n      <groupId>org.apache.metron</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>metron-maven-parser-extension-archetype</artifactId>\r\n      <version>0.4.0</version>\r\n      <description>Apache Maven Parser Extension Archetype for Metron</description>\r\n    </archetype>\r\n  </archetypes>\r\n</archetype-catalog>\r\n```\r\nWhen I run `mvn archetype:update-local-catalog` the entry appears in ~/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml. If I delete the entry and re-run that command, the entry reappears. Now when I run the archetype:generate command, the Metron archetype appears as expected. Is anyone else seeing this behavior?

QueryBuilder is thought of as a model than a utils class, the fields with '_' are used for display purpose and are not required to be persisted. I will take an another pass to see if I can refactor the code to make it look simple.In fact, the Saved Search and Recent Search Saves the query builder.\r\nI understand that SearchRequest might be a more suitable name so renaming QueryBuilder to SearchRequest makes sense ?. I am taking an another pass at abstracting all the API calls so that we can change the api provider to 'solr' or rest api easily form the UI.
