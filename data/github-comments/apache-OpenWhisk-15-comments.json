Things to fix in the PR to merge it in:\n\nAdd Readme.md to go-cli/README.md\nRemove \"BlueMix\" from go-cli/go-whisk-cli/Godeps\nDelete go-cli/go-whisk-cli/notes.md\nRemove everything except `Godeps/_worspace` from go-cli/.gitignore\n\nAdd to the README.md the use of the env variable WSK_CLI_DEBUG\n\nMove properties to config.xml\n    <property name=\"go-cli.build.dir\"        value=\"${basedir}/build/tools/go-cli\" />\n    <property name=\"go-cli.src.dir\"          value=\"${basedir}/tools/go-cli\" />\n\n## 2. Action items outside this PR:\n- look into depenencies versions we are currently using (go-whiks-cli/Godeps/Godeps.json)\n- look into GoVersion declare (1.5)go-whiks-cli/Godeps/Godeps.json)\n- `wsk property get` doesn't return info like python cli, need to pass --all\n- wsk cli apihost is hardcoded to (openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net), and it should be set to the value of edge.host from whisk.properties (i.e. edge.host=172.17.0.1)\n- the order of the properties don't mathc the python cli output with `wsk property get`\n- Positional parameters are not documented like python cli\n\n```\nwsk action create <name string> <artifact string> [flags]\nthe should be like this or similar: human description for the paramters\npositional arguments:\n  name                  the name of the action\n  artifact              artifact (e.g., file name) containing action\n                        definition\n```\n- Need to print a new line after ok result when creating a new action\n\n```\n$ ./wsk action create myaction myaction.js\nok: created action myactionvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/openwhisk/bin/go-cli/linux/amd64$\n```\n- can't pass numbers as parameters \n\n```\n./wsk -v action invoke myaction --blocking --result -p foo [1,2,3]\nThey get pass as string array instead of number array\nReq Body\n{{\"foo\":[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]}\n}\n\n- Pinned the versions of the dependencies, we should not have a dependency against the head/master of the git repo, relying on their repos to be available, and assume they don't do something that will break our CLI is a recipe for disaster. We can always update and refresh the dependency on a regular cadence.\n\nIn the python CLI it get's pass as numbers\nBody sent:\n{\"foo\": [1, 2, 3]}\nIn python to pass strings you need to escape with quotes\n ./wsk -v action invoke myaction --blocking --result -p foo [\\\"1\\\",\\\"2\\\",\\\"3\\\"]\n Body sent:\n{\"foo\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]}\n```\n\n## 3. Tips to improve later:\n- make env variables to only build one binary making dev cycle faster\n- look into implementing a watch/make task to automatically compile on source code change \n- upgrade version of from 1.6 to 1.7, 1.7 is GA\n- implement autocomplete for CLI ( we have recommendations when typos, but autocomplete will be also good to have)s\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/224987914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225009010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/609#issuecomment-225009010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/609","id":225009010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTAwOTAxMA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T20:00:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T20:00:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Rebased

think that comparing to other _serverless_ architectures is important because it improves the understanding and adoption of openwhisk.\n\nRegarding the callback, I agree that #56 is very welcome, especially for modern node runtimes.\n\n### Comparing to AWS Lambda\n\nAWS tweaked the programming model in the node 4.3 runtime, as opposed to the 0.10 runtime.\nCurrently the function prototype is:\n\n`function (event, context, callback)`\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html\n\nThe [Context](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-context.html) object holds metadata of the function and about the execution environment, including auth.\n\nThe user has to call `callback(error, result)`, so it's async-only.\n\n### Comparing to Google Cloud Function\n\nGoogle requires the user to package it's function as a npm module. The function prototype is:\n`function (context, data)`\nhttps://cloud.google.com/functions/writing\n\nThe `context` provides methods for function termination, `context.done`, much like openwhisk.\n`Data` is the event.\n\n### Comparing to Microsoft Azure Function\n\nAzure's function prototype is event shorter:\n`function(context)`\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-reference-node/\n\nYou end execution with `context.done`. You get event data also from the `context` object.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225226206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/225226762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/617#issuecomment-225226762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/617","id":225226762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTIyNjc2Mg==","user":{"login":"houshengbo","id":1542989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1542989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo","html_url":"https://github.com/houshengbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houshengbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T16:13:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T19:27:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
