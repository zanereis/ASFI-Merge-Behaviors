Thanks for testing the PR. This is a best-effort fix. The change just schedules the restart of the system VMs ahead of the user VMs. Now if there are fewer VMs for restart, there is a higher probability of all restart jobs getting executed at the same time by the HA-worker thread pool. In this case the fix won't be effective.
