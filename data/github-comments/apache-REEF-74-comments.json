For example, source puts metrics in a queue and sink in a separate thread will pull metrics from queue. The maximum length of the queue in turn allows us to make sure that too much memory is not consumed by metrics process and also allows to have the logic of specifying what to do if queue is full (for example sources should hang or just drop metrics.).\n\nOn the other hand, MetricsSource and actual metrics like counters and gauges might qualify for IObservable IObserver relationships since when MetricsSource is asked to fill in the metrics records, it can call OnNext of different metrics.\n\nSimilarly MetricsSink can be IObserver<MetricsRecord> , with appropriate IObservable defined in the default implementations which in the example above would be the queue implementation in which records are being pushed.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/233206457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/234012328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1076#issuecomment-234012328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1076","id":234012328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDAxMjMyOA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-20T16:59:27Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T16:59:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.

It is precisely what Rx is for: flowing events through a series of operators, one of which could be a queue.\n\nIn general, the API is fairly Java-ish. In C#, we could offer neat things like `_counters[\"BytesRead\"] += 7` or `_bytesReadCounter.OnNext(7)` which would look a lot nicer in client code.

A couple of questions:\n- Can you explain what makes them mutable vs. the other metrics?
