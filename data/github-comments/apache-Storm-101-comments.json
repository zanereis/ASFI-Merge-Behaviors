Presently only the CPU Utilization% is used to rank the components scheduled across the nodes on different workers as per the details in previous comment.<br/>\nAlso the present code depends on features developed internally which are not yet available in the community storm. We have plans to have it merged back and I would like to wait till then before I can open a new request and void this.  It would be helpful to hear opinion / suggestions on this.
