Can that be helpful? Removing the fields will save a lot of storage space from record level index.\r\n\r\n@prashantwason So far we only have `files` partition under metadata table. But, we are planning to bring in more partitions for storing other indices. So, the assumption of single partition for the metadata table will not hold good for long. Otherwise, removing 5 meta fields from each record by enabling virtual keys would definitely save a lot of space. We either have to improve the current metadata schema or infer the partition path from other cues for now.
