I just redo it on a fork before finding this PR...\r\nSo firstly\r\n- A mysql index can never use a nullable column.\r\n- If you look to the commit it is more a typo fix than something else. The column is set as nullable=false for postgresql as well\r\n- If you look to older script it is already set as nullable=false for those two table. So without the PR, it looks to a erroneous change to a nullable column, what is obviously forbidden.\r\n\r\nSo we can assume this PR is fine. So the real question is why travis is failing ?\r\nThe truth is probably that:\r\n- this PR is fine\r\n- travis test is working before this PR only because the database migration failure does not makes travis failed but avoid the running of something else that screw the build\r\n\r\nOn my box, when the PR is apply, the initialization goes further. It even show me that fernet dependency was not installed.... But it fails once I enable a dag with a:\r\n```\r\n_mysql_exceptions.IntegrityError: (1062, \"Duplicate entry 'print_context-timezone_bxl_10m-2018-01-24 14:26:10.137224' for key 'PRIMARY'\")\r\n```\r\nSo clearly the PR make it not functional.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, without this PR makes part of the initialization skipped.\r\n```\r\nairflow_1  | sqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (_mysql_exceptions.DataError) (1171, 'All parts of a PRIMARY KEY must be NOT NULL; if you need NULL in a key, use UNIQUE instead') [SQL: 'ALTER TABLE sla_miss MODIFY execution_date TIMESTAMP(6) NULL']\r\nairflow_1  | [2018-01-24 14:42:26,997] {{driver.py:120}} INFO - Generating grammar tables from /usr/lib/python3.5/lib2to3/Grammar.txt\r\nairflow_1  | [2018-01-24 14:42:27,030] {{driver.py:120}} INFO - Generating grammar tables from /usr/lib/python3.5/lib2to3/PatternGrammar.txt\r\nairflow_1  | [2018-01-24 14:42:27,148] {{__init__.py:45}} INFO - Using executor LocalExecutor\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we should find the bug behind the bug. I will continue to search, but since I am new to this project I am not sure I will find it shortly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/360158171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/360169586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2958#issuecomment-360169586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2958","id":360169586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDE2OTU4Ng==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-24T15:24:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T15:24:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fenglu-g

Indeed `airflow test` is used more than `run` to actually test tasks, but for example, the scheduler enqueues a `airflow run --local ...` command to the executors, and these are then run verbatim by the executors. In my foray into the scheduler and executor guts to fix [AIRFLOW-2001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2001), I felt the need to trigger the whole flow (as opposed to locally running a ti with `airflow test`), especially since a promising fix for that issue looks like treating different nonzero exit codes from the `airflow run --local ...` command executed on workers differently (currently any nonzero code means error).
