Sorry about the confusion.\r\n\r\nIn general, if you have something long-lived, it's better to rebase. Merging the branch that contained your merge-base back onto yours frequently creates confusing problems like this. Also, even if you did successfully merge without these kinds of issues, if somebody rebases again later, they'll probably have to re-resolve merge conflicts. So, it doesn't save any work to merge in. Rebase, on the other hand, keeps all the commit history linear in your feature branch, and is less likely to have these kinds of merge artifacts.\r\n\r\nI frequently do interactive rebase with long-lived branches (`git rebase -i`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/461173997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/461177580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/926#issuecomment-461177580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/926","id":461177580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MTE3NzU4MA==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-06T20:36:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T20:36:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would you like me to just re-branch from master and redo all the work?

Applications that took advantage of the performance improvements upgrading to 1.9 (I believe Fluo is one of them) will be impacted by reverting behavior back to 1.8. \r\n\r\n> Are there ways to use the znode timestamps / ids that could be used to determine if the cache is current?\r\n\r\nThis may be possible by checking the \"mtime\" on the tables node, which should indicate when a table ID -> name mapping was updated or table added/dropped.  This would require a bit more work though.\r\n\r\nI am thinking we may have put ourselves in a situation where we need to create another exists method.  Revert the behavior of the current method to always check zookeeper.  Than add a new method, something like \"existsInCache(String tableName, boolean clearCacheOnFail)\".
