The changes there remove the `SchemaInferenceUtil` usage and make direct use of Cell Type and Cell Style information. I highlighted some of the timestamp challenges in the description, but it provided better handling of date and time values from the test spreadsheet on the Jira issue. However, it would be great to get some additional testing of the changes, so we can collaborate on the approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2407692802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2407712979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9378#issuecomment-2407712979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9378","id":2407712979,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6PgsjT","user":{"login":"rfellows","id":713866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows","html_url":"https://github.com/rfellows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-11T16:04:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T16:04:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"will review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2407712979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2407713274","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9376#issuecomment-2407713274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9376","id":2407713274,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6Pgsn6","user":{"login":"rfellows","id":713866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows","html_url":"https://github.com/rfellows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfellows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-11T16:04:45Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T16:04:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"will review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2407713274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2408088333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9380#issuecomment-2408088333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9380","id":2408088333,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6PiIMN","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-11T20:35:17Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T20:35:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This needs testing in real world deployments before it becomes an always on default.

for your contribution @grishick.\r\n\r\nInstead of one property overruling the other and `SECRET_NAME_PATTERN` remaining required even though it may not have any effect, what are your thoughts on introducing a \"fetch mode\" (or whatever name you see fit)?\r\nWith the current rather implicit approach, users might provide a `SECRET_NAME_PATTERN` of e.g. `FOO_*` and a `SECRET_NAME` of `BAR` simultaneously. \r\nOn first look it might not be obvious what the behaviour is; which property overrules which or are the results from both combined?\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with this component, but to me it reads like introducing a different \"mode\" of fetching secrets.\r\nPersonally, I'd think first having to select a \"fetch mode\" with allowed values \"Secret by Name\" and \"All Secrets by Pattern\" (or something along those lines) and only then have the corresponding properties available would be more intuitive. \r\nAdditionally, this keeps the door open for other \"modes\" in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to extend the existing documentation of `SECRET_NAME_PATTERN` to clarify that it's use required the permission to list

The case in point I see is when the schema defines a boolean and the column returns a boolean from a formula. Without the formatted form, `1.0` is returned which will not be interpreted as a boolean in Java. With the formatted form, `TRUE` is returned which can interpreted as a boolean in Java.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2412419006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2412537184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/9386#issuecomment-2412537184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/9386","id":2412537184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM6PzGVg","user":{"login":"grishick","id":1310940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTA5NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1310940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick","html_url":"https://github.com/grishick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grishick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-14T23:49:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T23:49:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> > Thanks for the contribution @grishick, and thanks for the thoughtful feedback @EndzeitBegins.\r\n> > I concur with the recommendation from @EndzeitBegins.

With the `dependsOn()` builder method, the properties are shown or hidden based on the selected value, so in this case, it may be cleaner to have different properties to avoid any confusion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2412626189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
