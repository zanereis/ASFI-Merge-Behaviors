For `double`s we get the `long` represented by their bytes and treat as before. Since we're changing the values, I also took the chance to pick arbitrary constants to combine with.\n\nFor what it's worth, though, the previous `hashCode` helper functions are pretty much what are described in Effective Java. Anyway, I'll rebase and squash after you have a look.\n\n@jsirois That's a good idea.
