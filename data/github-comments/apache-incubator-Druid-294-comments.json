Alter behavior so limitSpec is applied after subtotalsSpec, rather than applied to\r\neach grouping set. This is more in line with SQL standard behavior. I think it is okay\r\nto make this change, since the old behavior was not documented, so users should\r\nhopefully not be depending on it.\r\n\r\nsaw this today, I think, with original behavior, I tried to replicate semantics equivalent of sending separate  queries for each subtotalsSpec individual (pre subtotalsSpec world) . That was the usecase at hand when subtotalsSpec feature  was created. However, I can't recall if that usecase \r\n did have needs for limitSpec.  @a2l007 do you know if there is dependency of  limit/sort spec  behavior when subtotalsSpecs  are used  ?\r\nIf a limitSpec (containing sort  spec) is applied in  the end then  that will mixup the rows and it would be difficult to identify  which rows  came from overall or which subtotalSpec .  Oracle appears to support  GROUPING function (Ref: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28314/tdpdw_sql.htm#TDPDW00714 ) to solve that problem in addition to having the behavior you described from `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` functions by adding '1' for dims not present in subtotal spec for rows created by  subtotalSpec.\r\nFor native query users, what would be the alternative to achieve similar effect? For  this reason,  it might be good to have a feature flag for enabling `old` behavior .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/589828549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/589934704","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8937#issuecomment-589934704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8937","id":589934704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTkzNDcwNA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-22T09:00:03Z","updated_at":"2020-02-22T09:00:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request/issue has been closed due to lack of activity.

Oracle appears to support GROUPING function (Ref: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28314/tdpdw_sql.htm#TDPDW00714 ) to solve that problem in addition to having the behavior you described from `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` functions by adding '1' for dims not present in subtotal spec for rows created by subtotalSpec.\r\n> For native query users, what would be the alternative to achieve similar effect? For this reason, it might be good to have a feature flag for enabling `old` behavior .\r\n\r\nI think we will have to add something similar to `GROUPING` (and `GROUPING_ID`: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/grouping-id-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15). I'm not sure what the best way is to do this. Maybe model it as an expression function, that people could use in a postaggregator or a having filter? But then we'd need some way of providing the current-grouping-set context to postaggregators and having filters somehow. I guess there's no way around that. Native query users would use the new function directly, and SQL users would get it through `GROUPING` and `GROUPING_ID`.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make that addition, but probably not in this patch. For now, you think I should add the 'legacy' flag or do you think I should document that things will get jumbled if you have a limitSpec? Personally, I'd rather do the latter, if people don't have use cases that depend on the legacy limitSpec behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/590652648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/590820077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9387#issuecomment-590820077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9387","id":590820077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDgyMDA3Nw==","user":{"login":"frnidito","id":11637948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM3OTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11637948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito","html_url":"https://github.com/frnidito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frnidito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T11:25:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T11:25:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@clintropolis — I added another retry, can you please re-run travis, or explain me how o do it, to check if it is now better?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/590820077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/590825669","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9387#issuecomment-590825669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9387","id":590825669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDgyNTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-25T11:41:31Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T11:41:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">@clintropolis — I added another retry, can you please re-run travis, or explain me how o do it, to check if it is now better?\r\n\r\nI can keep retries going, only committers can restart travis jobs.

Prior to the execution of a groupbyV2 query, the topN queries are consistently fast and remain so forever. These are steady-states. Within a mixed workload before or after, the topN queries will show the same degradation. It's not a dynamic temporary effect.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the segment scan time graph, you see that scan times for topN queries are very consistent before and after the single execution of a groupBy query, just much higher afterwards. \r\nThis graph would continue in this static state forever. \r\nAlso, the topN peformance prior to executing a first groupBy query is thee same as in a Druid cluster configured without SQL-compatible null handling.\r\n\r\nSo this is not an edge case by any means: If I were to switch the SQL-compatible null handling on in our production cluster which is running mixed workloads, the moment a groupby query would get executed for the first time, query performance for topNs would plummet considerably and not recover.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/591636541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/591657701","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9411#issuecomment-591657701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9411","id":591657701,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTY1NzcwMQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T21:39:09Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T21:39:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @sascha-coenen, I think the second `inputSource` with the `_SUCCESS` file is created for a subtask.

I haven't confirmed yet, but I suspect #8566 might be related.\r\n\r\nTry this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n\tCASE WHEN cityName IS NULL THEN FALSE ELSE TRUE END AS col_a,\r\n\tCASE WHEN countryName IS NULL THEN FALSE ELSE TRUE END AS col_b\r\nFROM wikipedia\r\nGROUP BY 1, 2\r\n```\r\n \r\nAnyway, the optimization calcite was doing uncovers another bug, which I think might be caused by the changes of #6902, which refactored druid sql to re-use virtual columns for the same expressions, but this appears to make grouping sad if both columns that are now the same virtual column are being grouped on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/591674647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/591675356","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9413#issuecomment-591675356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9413","id":591675356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTY3NTM1Ng==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-26T22:23:11Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T22:23:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think the real issue here is that the SQL-to-native-Druid-query logic currently can't handle `FROM (VALUES ...)`.
