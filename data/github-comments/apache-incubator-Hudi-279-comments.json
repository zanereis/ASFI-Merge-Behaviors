To fix this properly, I would suggest that Hudi either falls back to `ListingBasedRollbackStrategy` in such cases, or fails fast (at the time of scheduling rollback itself so that users can disable rollback using markers before rollback plan is written). @yihua wdyt?\r\n\r\n Does disabling 'hoodie.rollback.using.markers' make rollback inefficient?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1253137990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
