Was able to build hudi after enabling additional logging in the snippet originally shared (ws.getErrors) and found the exception to be \"ArrayIndexOutOfBounds\". It seems to be a specific use-case we have where we were getting an array field input as a string value that we were trying to cast to another datatype. This array could have variable number of elements for each row. And that somehow was causing an error at the time of writing to the hudi table. \r\n\r\nHowever, the issue here seems to be in error propagation.
