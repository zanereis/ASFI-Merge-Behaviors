If separate, it might be easier to update the documentation in the next PR because we'll have a clear installation path at that point (and the README will have to be rewritten anyways).  My preference would be to just do it here but I understand if you want to review them separately.  I guess my point is updating the documentation once makes more sense to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/394452217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/394459996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1043#issuecomment-394459996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1043","id":394459996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDQ1OTk5Ng==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T18:51:50Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T18:51:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@merrimanr There was a bit of discussion around this in #934, and it looks like the conclusion was that since HDP Search didn't support Solr 6 at the time, that we would hold off on it.

There is ever slight degradation (went from I believe 36k EPS in our setup for 1 enrichment to 33k EPS), however we are no longer at risk of dropping data.\r\n\r\nFor posterity purposes, the new implementation can be summarized as follows:\r\n- kafka producer has a number of settings for batching available via Kafka's client ProducerConfigs class. We are not manipulating these properties directly via the exposed config because we want to control batching in order to have the ability to have guarantees with Storm's acking mechanism.\r\n- The [BulkWriterComponent](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-writer/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/writer/BulkWriterComponent.java) class manages batching in terms of number of records and timeout. It's important to note that the KafkaProducer batches in terms of size in bytes whereas the writer component manages batches in terms or number of records, regardless of size. Previously, KafkaWriter was processing messages 1-by-1, asynchronously, and leveraging the KafkaProducer defaults. KafkaWriter now is a proper BulkMessageWriter that can handle sending multiple messages to Kafka by processing the Futures returned by the `public java.util.concurrent.Future<RecordMetadata> send(ProducerRecord<K,V> record)` method. We call `flush()` to ensure all Futures have been processed before returning their status back to the calling class.\r\n- We tweaked the default slightly under the hood for the Kafka Producer batch size - it was originally 16KB and our performance tests found the setting to be optimal around 64KB. This has been set as a default constant in the writer as we want users to leverage the batchSize and batchTimeout settings exposed via the standard Metron configuration.\r\n- It is possible, though not advised, to override the KafkaProducer batch.size and batch.timeout settings by adding the property to the Kafka producer config map in Flux or via parser properties. This should only be done as a matter of optimizing the Kafka batching caches as the producer will always allocate 64KB regardless of being full or not. The settings exposed in Metron for batchSize and batchTimeout should be sufficient, and again, our performance tests suggest that the defaults should be sufficient.

There is also a link in the top-level Jira:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1554.\r\n\r\nThe latest commit removes the Service classes so that only a sample controller remains.  I added a comment to that controller stating it should be replaced.  There was a Jira created for service development and API design:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1559.  Hopefully that makes it clearer that API design is out of scope for this PR.  I can also add a comment to that Jira once this PR gets accepted.\r\n\r\nI feel like spinning up and testing this in full dev should be part of the review.  Most of the changes here are Ambari and Maven related.  To test this properly there will need to be some way to submit a MR job (any job) from REST, hence the throwaway sample controller.  If you want to create your own sample controller and test that way I can remove the one in this PR.  Is there an easier option I'm not thinking of?\r\n\r\nMaintaining a needs addressed list sounds like a good idea.  I'm not clear on how this would work in practice though.  Where would we keep it?  Would Jira tasks serve this purpose?  This seems like it could be applicable to all tasks in this feature branch (all feature branches really) so I don't think this is the appropriate place to discuss it.  Can we move it back to a discuss thread so you can clarify and expand on your idea?  I think it needs some more thought if we're to adopt it as a process.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/395563290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/395583648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1056#issuecomment-395583648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1056","id":395583648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTU4MzY0OA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-07T22:19:01Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T22:19:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I spun this up in full dev and the only issue I could find was that starting REST doesn't throw an error when a required parameter is missing.

1 small bug.  The changes you made to table-view.component.html also need to be applied to tree-view.component.html.  You can test by selecting 2 groups and expanding one of the top level groups.  The alerts listed in the tree view should have scores instead of '-'.  I personally like what you did with the getScore method in meta-alerts.component.html. Would it make sense to keep it consistent across the various components?
