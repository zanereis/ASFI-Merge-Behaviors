- You are correct in that that doing `go-cli/wsk --apihost <valid host> property get --apibuild` will not behave like the Python API.\n\nThe hard Go CLI limitation is support for argument overloading - assigning the same named argument to the root command and also to a sub-command.  In this example, not only is the argument assigned twice, but it has different characteristics.  The `--apihost` argument assigned to the `wsk` root command takes a value while the `--apihost` argument assigned to the `property get` command does not.  The Go CLI argument package permits the assignment of the same argument name to different sub-commands as well as the root command; however, for any particular CLI invocation, all arguments are merged such that the argument is applied only to the last sub-command.\n\nIf we want the `wsk property get` command to take a apihost argument as the target host, the argument label will need to change.  That said, I think the better solution may be to separate the existing `wsk property` command into two commands - one for configuring the CLI and another for accessing whisk server values.  This would remove the `--apihost` argument overload conflict.\n\nSee also PR #924 comment

Since the controller will reflect its view of concurrent activity, this can be used by the UI directly and we can avoid logic getting out-of-sync.\n\nIf we do this, I think it should proceed in 3 phases:\n1.  **This first step should immediately make things better.**  Decrease the frequency of consul updates by the invoker so we have some breathing room.  Since we don't want extra connection and also don't want health updates to be slower, we can simply do the per user count writes on every other iteration of consul posting while doing health updates on every iteration. \n2. **This creates the appropriate abstraction for the monitoring service.**  Have the controller put into consul its view of concurrent activity.  The monitoring service should look only at these values and not at the old controller values and not anything from the invoker.\n3. **Intermediate step to confirm that adding 2 extra (small) fields will not impact performance**  Extend the active ack with the additional fields as outlined in \"New idea\" above.\n4. **Cutover to new logic and decrease consul traffic**  Change the controller to use active ack and maintain the new maps and no longer poll consul for invoker information.   Delete the posting of per counts by the invokers.

Currently, the user is not expected to provide k1 in valid JSON format, and the CLI will handle the conversion of the k1 string into a valid JSON string.

@csantanapr is it still possible to run the openwhisk vagrant machine without mounting a shared folder?\n\nThe use case was not very useful and was bring a lot of confusing on having too many ways to setup, and tend to let people just workaround root cause problems.\n\nWe should not be using \"ln\" anywhere to have a chance to support windows natively, there are lot of developer that only have Windows as their dev workstation.\n\nThis `tools/go-cli/build.gradle` is incompatible with Windows by using \"ln\"\nhttps://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/tools/go-cli/build.gradle#L32\n\n```\n   String link_to_path = new File(\"${projectDir}/../../bin/go-cli/wsk\").getCanonicalPath()\n    String link_from_path = new File(\"${projectDir}/../../bin/go-cli/${go_osname}/${go_osarch}/wsk\").getCanonicalPath()\n    exec {\n        executable \"ln\"\n        args \"-s\", \"${link_from_path}\", \"${link_to_path}\"\n    }\n```\n\nThe strange thing is that we already inside the VM in vagrant and it work\nhttps://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/tools/vagrant/Vagrantfile#L134\n\n```\n  rm -r bin/wsk && rm -r bin/wskadmin\n  (cd bin && sudo ln -s ../tools/cli/wsk wsk)\n  (cd bin && sudo ln -s ../tools/cli/wskadmin wskadmin)\n```\n\nI guess if we use `sudo` it might work, the problem is that would cause problems, like mac trying to run with `sudo`\n\nI think the quick fix is to just do a copy of the binary (using gradle ) , instead of `ln`\n\n```\ntask copyTask(type: Copy) {\n    from '${link_from_path}'\n    into '${link_to_path}'\n}\n```\n\nMore elegant solution would be to write wrapper scripts wsk (bash) and wsk.bat, for the bash it will detect if linux or mac, and the arch, for windows will detect the arch and then delegate to the correct binary on the fly.\n\n@mdeuser can you take this one since you are the one that has a Windows box and can test the propose fix with copyTask?\nWhy you think you have not hit this problem on your Windows workstation? maybe you created the symlink manually, and it's seating there making any subsequent calls to `ln` to be ignore/success\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/237542366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/237546980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/996#issuecomment-237546980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/996","id":237546980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzU0Njk4MA==","user":{"login":"jberstler","id":7012682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTI2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7012682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler","html_url":"https://github.com/jberstler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jberstler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T13:06:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T13:06:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">
