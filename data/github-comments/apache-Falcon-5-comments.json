I have a bigger picture in mind. There will be a client module which will empower both the existing `cli` and the new `cli` in development. The existing `cli` will still be called `cli`, while I intend to rename the new cli to `shell`. (Notice that the code in this pull request is still living in the `cli` module.) With that, the `client` module will empower two modules. The constants class that has been extracted right now contains only the string constants for option names, and option descriptions are not refactored. That seems incomplete to me on the one hand, while on the other hand, I've seen instances where multiple CLI subclasses are using the same option names but different option descriptions. So I'm reluctant to empower that class right now. So, I'll use that to the extent that duplication of constants is removed, but no more. \n\nSecondly, I talked about the bigger picture. I have completely developed the new cli in #14, #52, #53, #54 and #55. They have been there for a little over 3 months now without anyone to review. My intention is to get those merged, then separate the modules out, and then do a final refactoring like FALCON-1895. What you are suggesting will need me to do a major refactoring in each of those pull requests. That will be a slow process for me since I don't work full-time on Falcon. Whereas making minor changes would take minimal time, and that I can afford. And even with refactoring each of those, a final refactoring might still be required. \n\nSo, in favor of faster development of the shell, I'm proposing that we first move forward with what's already there (#14, #52, #53, #54, #55) and then clean up later. After the clean-up, I intend to unify the `cli` and `shell` through a shell script, where typing `falcon ...` will go through the CLI path, but just typing `falcon` will open the `shell`. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/226143396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/226218052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/falcon/pull/185#issuecomment-226218052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/185","id":226218052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjIxODA1Mg==","user":{"login":"bvellanki","id":7927462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mjc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7927462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki","html_url":"https://github.com/bvellanki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T15:10:44Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T15:10:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/226218052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/comments/226352126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/falcon/pull/186#issuecomment-226352126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/falcon/issues/186","id":226352126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjM1MjEyNg==","user":{"login":"bvellanki","id":7927462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mjc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7927462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki","html_url":"https://github.com/bvellanki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvellanki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T23:46:41Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T23:46:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sowmyaramesh  +1 to the patch.
