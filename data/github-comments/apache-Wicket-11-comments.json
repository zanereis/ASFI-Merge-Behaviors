the whole point of this PR was that ajax *could* be used with strict CSP if proper behaviours used. (some old ajax behaviours using evals won't obviously work)\r\n\r\nLet me merge back the master and see how it works together with nonce

We had some custom logging asking for the name of the page class after the session had already been detached. We only noticed it in production with locked page exceptions - this would have made debugging much easier. \r\n@svenmeier I wonder if you can comment on why we only saw it very rarely. My theory was to do with unmounted pages: most of our pages are mounted and presumably resolving the page class uses some shortcut in code - without requiring a page lock. Resolving the name for unmounted pages does require a lock and caused the LockedPage exception on subsequent request. Does that sound reasonable? Our current fix only disables that (unnecessary) bit of logging -- and it seems to work -- but I wonder if I'm merely fixing a symptom of the real issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/521456564/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/521639247","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/380#issuecomment-521639247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/380","id":521639247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTYzOTI0Nw==","user":{"login":"svenmeier","id":543253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/543253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/svenmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svenmeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-15T13:24:34Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T13:24:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hard to tell what might increase the likelihood of that happening.

However, there must be a tidy way to call the function without touching the DOM at all (rfc/rpc).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/525530622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/526529653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/378#issuecomment-526529653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/378","id":526529653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjUyOTY1Mw==","user":{"login":"martin-g","id":232002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjAwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/232002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g","html_url":"https://github.com/martin-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martin-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-30T09:19:56Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T09:19:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"would it be smarter if we reuse the `<script>` element and replace only its body ? would the browser re-evaluate the new body ?

This is my take on a new modal dialog/window for Wicket.\r\n\r\nHi @svenmeier \r\n\r\nHave you had a chance to check out the way Modals work in the Wicketstuff ModalX project? It uses Wicket core Modal classes 'as is' but makes them much more easy to set up and use for the developer.\r\n\r\nThere may be some useful ideas in there that could improve the whole Modal experience for Wicket devs if brought into core Wicket.\r\n\r\nThe way Wicketstuff Modal X facilitates modal dialogs makes it very easy to open any modal dialog from anywhere in the app just by calling the constructor on the class of the modal you want to open and then calling show().\r\n\r\nIt supports nesting up to N levels. The 'N' can be specified by the dev.\r\n\r\nAny page that needs modal simply needs to implement the org.wicketstuff.modalx.ModalMgr interface (typically you do this once in a commonly used base page class so that the whole app becomes Modal capable very easily).\r\n\r\nThe ModalMgr base class auto adds 'N' placeholder components to any page that it renders and these are then automatically allocated in sequence each time a new modal is nested upon another one. As the modals are closed the placeholders are freed up in reverse sequence until, when the last modal is closed, they are all freed up and the user can then proceed to open another top level modal etc.,","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/569463952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
