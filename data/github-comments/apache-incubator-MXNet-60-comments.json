So here are some updates and questions after I tried implementing EASGD and EAMSGD (momentum EASGD) for single machine case. Anyone interested in implementing this one can have an idea on how to do so. Right now the result looks good. I did't post the code here because I went the nasty approach of modifying model.py and optimizer.py files. \n\nauther implementation for Torch link: [mpiT](https://github.com/sixin-zh/mpiT)\n\nHow to implement in MxNet:\n1.  modify the _update_params_on_kvstore and implement everything according to paper,I used the kvstore to manage averaging weight, and you need to pass in optimizer to learning rate etc..\n2. create a dummy optimizer which passes pushed gradient to weight.\n3. (optional) if u are implementing EAMSGD, you need to create a velocity array in the train_multi_machine for momentum and pass it to _update_params_on_kvstore.\n4. modify train_multi_machine so u can call modified _update_params_on_kvstore according to the optimizer object type. Basically using \"if else\" stuff.\n5. on each epoch testing, you need to synchronize each worker weight once using weight stored in kvstore(the averaging weight author used, I took the mean of works which is a little different). Make a copy of original one before this action,cause each worker weight is different, and restore it back after testing.\n\nQuestions:\nIs there any documents explaining multi machine updating details? How my modification on _update_params_on_kvstore  and optimizer affects dist_sync case? \n\nNow I'm trying to scale this algorithm for multiple machines. My brain messed up with this case as I have no experience on this. I did 2 experiments using dmlc_mpi.py both with n=2, s=1 but 2 different kvstore setup (dist_sync, dist_async). the dist_async works while the dist_sync failed converging. I did't expected dist_async to work as my single machine code is for sync case, the single machine async case is not tested (because I don't know how to do so, LOL. I guess dmlc_local might be a direction).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/203296822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/203299037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1751#issuecomment-203299037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1751","id":203299037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMzI5OTAzNw==","user":{"login":"Godricly","id":17567935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3OTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly","html_url":"https://github.com/Godricly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Godricly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-30T07:47:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-30T07:47:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"you need a kernel function to process GPU data.

ANyway I amstruggling with installing MxNet on windows with R. I have been using the cpu version but will like to migrate to thr gpu version.\nFirstly, I have tried to follow the instructions on [http://myungjun-youn-demo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/build.html] but with no complete success yet. I have installed VS12 and the VS compiler.\nI have managed to install it with python using the pre-built and I ran the test code which works. That is as far as I tested it for now. But all these was done at command prompt with python27. When I tried to import mxnet from anaconda it did not work neither was I able to run the setup.py file through Anaconda. \n\nFirst question is, how can integrate mxnet with Anaconda given that Anaconda came pre-packed with its python and wasn't using the same package folder as python27.\n\nMy second question is that I am experiencing same as @Lodewic, I followed all his steps but on what platform will I run the command `R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch` I am a bit lost there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/204571205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/204589813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1085#issuecomment-204589813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1085","id":204589813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDU4OTgxMw==","user":{"login":"raylite","id":12174479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc0NDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12174479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite","html_url":"https://github.com/raylite","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raylite/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T22:17:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T22:17:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I figured out my mistakes and now I ran the command on promt.

are two ways that pop out from my head:\n- Use the imperative API to chain the modules, with each module binded as executor(need to manually do forward/backward)\n- Rebind a executor each time on the same parameter with different graphs, using the shared executor option. This depend on how long it takes to create a new executor on the fly. We have not yet tested this, but this could still be faster than forward/backward. So if you issue asynchronize command, and generate next executor in concurrent with execution, it could be OK.\n\nBoth might require use of customized training loop or hack a bit into the model training API\n\nThe runtime regeneration is similar to bucketing, except that in bucketing the executor is cached, so also cc @pluskid for this\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/204808789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/204808822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1778#issuecomment-204808822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1778","id":204808822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDgwODgyMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-02T21:51:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T21:51:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I see.
