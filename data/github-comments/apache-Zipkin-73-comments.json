domain name part, as the `http.host` annotation. This is decoded by the underlying adaptor, typically `cowboy` in the Elixir world, from the `Host` header.\r\n\r\nWhat gets annotated on outgoing HTTP client requests is entirely up to the user of the HTTP client, since the library provides no integrations for any particular clients, nor any helpers (e.g. for translating a URL into annotations).\r\n\r\nNB the `Host` header seen by pods in Kubernetes is under the control of the ingress controller, and therefore will vary, depending on how the ingress controller is configured, i.e. you might see the external service host, but you might not, and indeed the header could even be dropped entirely (though this is not valid HTTP 1.1). Equally, the ingress controller may be configured to send a useful `X-Forwarded-For-Host` header, or it may not. Hopefully something useful ends up in the request, that can be used for the `http.host` annotation, but it is unlikely to be consistent across tracer clients, especially across system boundaries.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/412348104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/412400754","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2152#issuecomment-412400754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2152","id":412400754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjQwMDc1NA==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-13T03:37:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T03:37:40Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"sorry took so long wrote most of the proposal https://etherpad.net/p/zipkin-asf-proposal as a straw man based on jclouds which I am most familiar with.

Usually folks never touch this code and don't want it to become complex.  I do understand there is some finesses here.\r\n\r\n## why isolate read traffic? it makes concurrency easier and without multiple settings\r\nSo, my question about the query vs collector was this comment:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2166#discussion_r209559144\r\n> Our problem now is that the HttpCall is shared for the mixed use of query api operations and collector api insertions. There is no chance for reservation of the same amount of HttpCalls as Kafka worker threads: KAFKA_STREAMS parameter.\r\n\r\nSo, what I was getting at was that if there was a semaphore at the collector level, or some bounding by stream count, or a combination.. if only collector traffic went to that instance (via QUERY_ENABLED=false), wouldn't we be able to simplify because we don't need to concern with read traffic to the HttpCall api?\r\n\r\n## Should we continue this PR?\r\nYou asked about continuing this PR. As mentioned many times, I will not merge tight coupling between http call and the collector tier. Please stop proposing this. If that's your goal, maybe you should put this change down and wait for someone else to pick it up as reviewing is taking longer than actually doing the change. There are plenty of options and tight coupling between storage impl and collector impl is the least favorable for maintenance.\r\n\r\n## Let's review prior art: SQS\r\nFor example, in SQS exceptions except IllegalArgumentException are implicitly retried (due to lack of a follow-up delete message) https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws/blob/master/collector-sqs/src/main/java/zipkin2/collector/sqs/SQSSpanProcessor.java#L130 They also aren't affecting storage layer, rather assuming IllegalArgumentException is not retryable. Of course, this retry policy might not be awesome, but it is easier to reason about and a function to select exceptions would be straight forward to discuss (especially if separate). SQS also has a backoff mechanism which is simple in nature. What I like very much is that SQS did not ask to change the storage layer or borrow a storage specific semaphore to do its backoff etc. That made the SQS code less scary to me: that the retry semantics were isolated.\r\n\r\n## Let's review options!\r\nThis like concurrency gates have options, and zipkin-server is made with spring. You can use AOP and all sorts of things to weave in advanced things as a means to experiment. Let's not forget this as it is better than committing experiments or code that only one site needs. For example, I don't think that most would find it optimal to spend a lot of time on a site who wants to handle a lot of load with only one collector node and also limited storage capacity. Focusing on how that site can use other tools can also be possible.. ex answering the spring question of how to weave in other libraries like https://github.com/Netflix/concurrency-limits\r\n\r\nYou can also make a custom collector! For example, if you are convinced of one approach, you can package your own collector the same way that kafka08 does (module). It is actually a good idea to try and test things, and if you need back/forth style advice on this, gitter is best to do that: https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\r\n\r\n## OK back to work.. what are we trying to do?\r\n\r\nThe most discussed part of this change is that a polling collector is in a loop, and there's no value to pulling off spans you can't store! block on storage will definitely slow the amount of requests going to the backend with minimal impact when polling.  For example, the polling loop will then pause until it knows there is an error or not. \r\n\r\nOur goal was to make some cheap change, like cheap to make cheap to review, isolated.\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts, but overall use tests to drive your ideas. without tests it is really hard to reason with the full set of options especially when one of the reviewers is asleep!\r\n\r\n### option 1:  polling collector ~= limiting the concurrent with synchronous api\r\nFor example, in elasticsearch this isn't waiting until indexing is done iirc, this is only waiting to know if it was accepted. IOTW, we are blocking until we know there is an error then proceeding. Blocking on storage can be implemented with semaphores and things (possible change 2), or it can be simply using the synchronous api. IMHO, the latter is easier to reason with especially in a loop. @llinder @devinsba or others have feedback on this.\r\n\r\n### option 2: polling collector ~= limiting the concurrent requests with semaphores\r\nif you do block on storage (change 1), yes there is a limit to how many concurrent requests can be in-flight as no more than the concurrency limit for queue processors. In Kafka, yes it would be stream count, in Rabbit the channel count. If the limit should be higher than queue count, this means you can't use the synchronous api (execute), rather a collector tier semaphore. If proposed, I don't personally even want to review this without tests.\r\n\r\n### separate concern: on exception re-process spans\r\nIn Kafka, we could already implement a means to resubmit work similar to SQS. We can do this with or without a collector-tier change. For example, and especially if in a blocking loop, we can hold a reference to the initial spans and retry them on a condition, whether or not that condition is pluggable. If we did this, ideally there's a way to stop trying (avoiding poison messages from stopping everything). This thing should be heavily tested.\r\n\r\n### separate concern: on exception sleep\r\nCollector or storage tier can sleep as opposed to immediately redoing the same command. SQS has a naive but probably fine approach for at least one site. If there needs to be more finesse on how to decide which way to sleep, that could be done in a relatively decoupled way, as simply as an okhttp elasticsearch interceptor for example! It could also be possible to make a generic exception handler, but I personally think it is a bit early for this. At any rate this is a separate change!\r\n\r\n## Wrapping up\r\nPlease choose an option which makes sense to you and decide which you'd like to do or not. Please consider simplest first and do this in separate steps to conserve time for others who also need review or coding help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/412720964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/412800082","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2166#issuecomment-412800082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2166","id":412800082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgwMDA4Mg==","user":{"login":"malonso1976","id":6059834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6059834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976","html_url":"https://github.com/malonso1976","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malonso1976/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T08:46:19Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T08:46:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Adrian,\r\n   I am really interested in solving this issue and contributing back to zipkin. I really appreciate the time you are investing in reviewing my pull request and I thank you for that.\r\n   Having said that, I want to be sure that the solution proposed is acceptable for you, so that the pull-request succeeds. All we are doing together is finding a suitable solution that meets your acceptance criteria.\r\n\r\n   Alternatives:\r\n\r\n- Semaphore at collector level: this would mimic the behaviour defined by elastic HttpCall at the collector level. It is easy to implement, requires and additional configuration parameter to setup the semaphore count. This solution works is like an intermediate queue/buffer between collector and storage to overcome capacity problems on the storage side, limiting maximum storage running span insertions.\r\n- Retry policy at collector level: we need to define under which exceptions retry shall be performed. On elastic IllegalStateException(\"over capacity\"). On cassandra it might be a DriverException subclass (BusyPoolException). This solution is similar to SQS: max number of retries and an adaptative wait time, upper bounded by a max wait time. Optionally a concurrency limit algorithm can be used to control congestion.\r\n\r\n   I'd rather go for Semaphore at collector level, but if I choose a solution on my own without agreeing it with you, makes this a \"trial-error\" processs none of us would like to enter into.\r\n\r\n   What do you think?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/412800082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/412811111","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2166#issuecomment-412811111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2166","id":412811111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjgxMTExMQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T09:26:22Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T09:26:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the loopback.\n\nPersonally, I link to https://github.com/Netflix/concurrency-limits as\nonce we get into semaphores and such, the code becomes higher\nmaintenance. I'd rather shade a dependency on that vs start building\nthe code (incidentally concurrency-limits core has no dep except\nslf4j)\n\nOne approach we can take external to this PR which could help in\nguiding this is to use RejectedExecutionException when there's a\nretryable exception. This is the same runtime exception that\nconcurrency-limits uses.\nhttps://github.com/Netflix/concurrency-limits/blob/744f8ae10523b0963b5d9453ce5d0d5c90d32139/concurrency-limits-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/concurrency/limits/executors/BlockingAdaptiveExecutor.java#L16\n\nWe can add javadoc to the SpanConsumer saying that implementations\nshould callback with RejectedExecutionException when they know an\nexternal limit such as a BusyPoolException has happened. This should\nbreak nothing, for example it would not break the code in SQS.\nHowever, it could prepare us in a way where we can automatically\naddress resource constraints. It is also nicely decoupled IMHO. what\ndo you think?\n\nIf you like it, maybe go ahead and make elasticsearch and cassandra\nuse RejectedExecutionException (even if by wrapping) as a

(These rights have to be transferred before you can graduate - so there's time to figure out the details, but it is a hard requirement)\r\n\r\nSo - it depends.  If you want to have \"Apache Zipkin\" that releases zipkin-client-x.y.zip, then the ZIPKIN name has to be solely given to the ASF; no other projects could release software using the ZIPKIN name.\r\nI'm not sure exactly how Brave works/is branded, but a group outside could continue to release brave-server-x.y.zip if they wanted, and call it \"BRAVE\" or \"BRAVE, powered by Apache Zipkin\" or things like that.  They could not call the product being released ZIPKIN BRAVE or anything like that.\r\n\r\nNote also that you can choose to change to a new name during incubation if the community wants to (although it doesn't sound like you'd want to).\r\n\r\n- The ASF does not want your copyright assignments.  What the ASF does require is IP Clearance of the code drop being donated (verifying that all the IP is licensed such that the ASF can license it without restriction under Apache-2.0), and a signed ICLA license agreement from anyone who wants to be a committer on the new podling at the Incubator.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't make sense, don't worry: the point is the ASF only needs the right license for the work, not an actual assignment of the underlying copyright.  Apache committers keep copyright on the code they write; it's just that the ICLA to the ASF ensures the ASF has enough rights to always outbound license any submissions to the world under our license.
