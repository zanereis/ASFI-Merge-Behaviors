We can do this in a better way by adding generic API method(to AiravataAPIServer) like \"getAllCredentialSummary\" instead of adding API method for each credential types eg: \"getAllGatewaySSHPubKeysSummary\" which will return all the credential summary for that particular gatewayId. You may be able to remove few redundant methods from Airavata API server.\n2. Let's introduced one credential summary struct to all credential types, how we differentiate is we have credential type enum field( SSH, PASSWD, CERT etc ) in the credential summary thrift struct. \n3.
