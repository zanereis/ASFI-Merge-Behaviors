Hi, can we explain in detail what are we trying to fix here ?\r\n\r\nWhen we build a mor table, for example create a table named test1 using Sparksql.then we'll see the table inputFormat is HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat through hive client,because the default value of inputFormat is HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat.When use hive sync metadata and skip the _ro suffix.then we'll get two tables like test1,test1_rt,their inputFormat value are all HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat,test1 was created before syncing. Meta Sync does not change inputFormat, so I changed the default value this time.

see you have some very old dates. \r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkUpgradeException: You may get a different result due to the upgrading of Spark 3.0: writing dates before 1582-10-15 or timestamps before 1900-01-01T00:00:00Z into Avro files can be dangerous, as the files may be read by Spark 2.x or legacy versions of Hive later, which uses a legacy hybrid calendar that is different from Spark 3.0+'s Proleptic Gregorian calendar. See more details in SPARK-31404. You can set spark.sql.legacy.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite to 'LEGACY' to rebase the datetime values w.r.t. the calendar difference during writing, to get maximum interoperability. Or set spark.sql.legacy.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite to 'CORRECTED' to write the datetime values as it is, if you are 100% sure that the written files will only be read by Spark 3.0+ or other systems that use Proleptic Gregorian

thanks for your advise,I found that this problem was caused by the conflict between SPARK3.2 and HUDI 0.11.1. In HUDI 0.11.1 with HiveSyncTool.getSparkTableProperties(),the spark.sql.sources.provider set to hudi,but in Spark3.2,HiveClientImpl does not support \"show parititons\" for tables whose provider is HUDI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1223449366/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1223475113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5330#issuecomment-1223475113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5330","id":1223475113,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5I7L-p","user":{"login":"LinMingQiang","id":14815873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODE1ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14815873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinMingQiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinMingQiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-23T03:09:44Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T03:09:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"see
