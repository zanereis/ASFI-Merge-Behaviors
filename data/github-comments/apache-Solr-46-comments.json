How would you update the schema of your collection? In standalone, the schema.xml file is replicated to the replica. But that will not work here since Solr reads its schema from each local ZK. So then you need to do `solr zk upconfig` six times instead of one. Managing split source of truth will be a nightmare.

approach works fine as far as JAX-RS and Solr are concerned.  In fact I'm sure you noticed it's how things were structured when these classes lived in 'core'.\r\n\r\nThe problem is code-generation.  As each SolrRequest class is being generated, it needs to be able to import the Java POJOs it relies on.  And the SolrRequest-generation is using the OAS as its input, not the existing Java code directly - so it doesn't have access to information like Java fully-qualified class names as it's being processed.\r\n\r\n(openapi-generator has the ability to generate model POJOs for users, and handles imports much more gracefully in this case.  We've decided _not_ to generate models though, since they'd essentially duplicate the POJOs that we already have.  The \"import\" problem is the main downside of that decision.)\r\n\r\nRight now we work around this limitation in our template by keeping things pretty simple in terms of imports - we essentially expect all POJOs to be in a single package without any static class nesting that'd change the import pattern. (see [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/3cbb97549cef1664a1d6b01fd2d1367cefbb0665/solr/solrj/build.gradle#L135) and [here](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/3cbb97549cef1664a1d6b01fd2d1367cefbb0665/solr/solrj/src/resources/java-template/api.mustache#L39))\r\n\r\nAnyway, this feels like a fixable problem to me if it's worth it to us to dig in.  I spent a few hours tweaking the OpenAPI spec and `api.mustache` template without much success, but there's gotta be some fix out there.  I guess it just depends how strongly we care about being able to have POJOs nested the way @HoustonPutman described...

I wonder though if we should think about having a explicit \"integration\" tests subdir? We use BATS for both \"unit testing\" our Bash scripts, but also now are using it more and more to run a integration or End 2 End test for Solr. (For example, my adding a test to verify stand alone Solr replication!)... Maybe for another ticket if we find that these bats tests start taking a REALLY long time.\r\n\r\nYeah I guess we could move the bash scripts somewhere else, but I think this is a fine place for the \"integration\" tests. Overall I think this is a separate issue though, since there already are integration tests here, and this is testing the bash stuff.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1714423565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1714429359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1898#issuecomment-1714429359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1898","id":1714429359,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5mMB2v","user":{"login":"stillalex","id":61026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex","html_url":"https://github.com/stillalex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stillalex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-11T19:05:33Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T19:05:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"updated the major changes doc. @dsmiley would appreciate a quick sanity check before merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1714429359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1714674897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1769#issuecomment-1714674897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1769","id":1714674897,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5mM9zR","user":{"login":"solrbot","id":125606113,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3yY4Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125606113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot","html_url":"https://github.com/solrbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solrbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-11T22:34:47Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T22:34:47Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"### ⚠ Artifact update problem\n\nRenovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch.

For example, if there's already pending changes in the `ZkStateWriter`, and a no op changes invocation to `enqueueUpdate` can invoke the callback while the actual pending changes are not flushed.\r\n\r\nThe existing behavior (shortcut no-op/empty ops and skip callback) is not ideal but is technically correct, as the `ZkWriteCallback#onWrite` method has description of `Called by ZkStateWriter if state is flushed to ZK`, since the empty/no-op operation does not trigger any state flush, it should not invoke the callback neither.\r\n\r\nThis callback might not work in certain edge case, for example if there are a mix of both PRS and non PRS enabled collection, a PRS related operation might invoke `ZkWriteCallback#onWrite` while the operations for non PRS collections are still pending.
