It's a good point to standardise the response. Will follow your suggestion. Will updte the documentation as well.\r\n\r\nRegarding exposing details in this health check response, I'm a bit conservative. For example, the `open_connections` in the sample you gave should only be exposed to someone with Admin privilege (or at least logged-in users). In short, maybe we want to avoid exposing too much information here given no authentication is needed to access this endpoint.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"scheduler\": {\r\n    \"status\": \"healthy\",\r\n    \"latest_scheduler_run\": \"2018-12-26 17:15:11+00:00\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"webserver\": {\r\n    \"status\": \"healthy\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"metadatabase\": {\r\n    \"status\": \"healthy\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Status of `metadatabase`: decided by if a simple query can succeed or not.\r\n- Status of `scheduler`: decided by `current_time_stamp - latest_scheduler_run >= 30 seconds`. If `True`, scheduler is \"unhealthy\"; if `False`, scheduler is \"healthy\". Please advise if this threshold (30 sec) makes sense or should it be smaller?
