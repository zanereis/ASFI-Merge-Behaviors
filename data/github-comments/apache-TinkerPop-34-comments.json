This change effectively breaks existing `VertexProgram` implementations, doesn't it? Meaning, nothing in TinkerPop calls the deprecated method anymore, so existing `VertexProgram` implementations will no longer have the old method called at runtime - it will call the empty default method instead here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/772/files#diff-ca108f45ec7b5a288dfce8019f1a6813L72\r\n\r\nPerhaps the right way to do this is to:\r\n\r\n1. Make the new method call the deprecated one by default. In that way, existing `VertexProgram` implementations just work on upgrade. Leave the deprecated one empty.\r\n2. Our `VertexProgram` implementations implement the new method, so they will all work without a problem. The old deprecated method should be implemented on these classes to call the new method. This way, if someone (for some weird reason) is relying on the behavior of the old method it will still work without change (you would need to add appropriate deprecation annotation/javadoc here.\r\n3. People who write new `VertexProgram` implementations wouldn't bother with the old deprecated method - perhaps some stronger language in the javadoc would make that clear to them.\r\n3. Write [upgrade docs](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/tp32/docs/src/upgrade/release-3.2.x-incubating.asciidoc) to describe the new expectations around `VertexProgram` implementations and include a changelog entry - i can do that if you like on merge.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound? \r\n\r\nbtw, sorry - this is turning into a complicated PR - thanks for continuing to work through this with us.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358005853/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358048367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/778#issuecomment-358048367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/778","id":358048367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODA0ODM2Nw==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T17:54:43Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T17:54:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

They're failing because for the test I added I want to create my own graph and add two vertices and two edges to it (see `runTest(Direction)` at line 2665 of `GraphComputerTest.java`). Is there a better way to do this that will be acceptable for Spark where it seems the graph is immutable? I was trying to not have to create another GraphML/GraphSON/Gryo graph to be stored.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358167182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/358168315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/772#issuecomment-358168315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/772","id":358168315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODE2ODMxNQ==","user":{"login":"PBGraff","id":7247103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDcxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7247103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff","html_url":"https://github.com/PBGraff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PBGraff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-17T01:49:44Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T01:49:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think that sounds like a reasonable plan and I would appreciate it if you can cover part 4 on merge.

A little question here, although maven can generate a jar file for the module gremlin-shade, my IDE is not ok with it. It can find dependencies which should provided by this module, such as:\r\nimport org.apache.tinkerpop.shaded.kryo.Kryo;\r\nAny way I can deal with this? It will be great help.
