@merlimat which unit tests were failing because of this? \r\n\r\nI was debugging the `RawReaderTest` in which the assertion was failing because of duplicated messages. It was because of the out-of-order acks that the client was re-sending some of the messages. But I saw the assertion failure at https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/48431543729fc4f382637c968976d0d164d5427b/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/OpAddEntry.java#L143 in the logs of several other flaky unit tests in last week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/426340681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/426352104","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2504#issuecomment-426352104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2504","id":426352104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjM1MjEwNA==","user":{"login":"aahmed-se","id":8009085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se","html_url":"https://github.com/aahmed-se","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aahmed-se/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T17:02:27Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T17:02:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/426352104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/426352530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2696#issuecomment-426352530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2696","id":426352530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjM1MjUzMA==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T17:03:48Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T17:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdhabalia The reason this is separated is to avoid mixing the dependencies.
