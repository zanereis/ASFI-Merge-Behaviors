Option (3) will definitely complicate deployment.  I think I like option 2, perhaps paired with some optional platform-specific builds that do include the extra jar within our uber jar.  That way, we could still build & release just the plain jar that relies on the user including the appropriate blas jar on the classpath, but also have the option to build and release platform-specific jars by including the appropriate native blas jar (and appropriate jcuda jar) into our uber jar.  The platform-specific jars would just be for user convenience.

Looks like it is failing a test still -- `org.apache.sysml.test.integration.functions.misc.DataTypeChangeTest#testDataTypeChangeValidate4c`.  Looking into it, it fails due to trying to cast a Matrix to a Scalar object.  At a deeper level, it looks like the propagated variable map is holding onto the \"matrix\" `X`, rather than dropping it as it should, since X is turned into a scalar by the call `X = foo(X)`.  Interestingly, the FunctionOp for the `foo` function is marked as having an `Unknown` datatype and valuetype.  That to me seems to be  big issue, but I'm not sure exactly where that is failing.
