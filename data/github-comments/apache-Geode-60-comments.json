It will be helpful if you can add more information with the example (depending on the issue).\r\n\r\nE.g. \r\nAvoid sending CQ events for specific CQ query-operations (E.g. destroy Query operation) to client.\r\nFor a region.put() which results in CQ event with its query operation as destroy; avoid sending this event to client.\r\n\r\nI am not seeing any value/scenario that needs this kind of behavior. Do you have any example can you please explain here.\r\n\r\nThe core CQ design aspect was to establish a data view representing a query result that can be expressed in the form of query.  And support event mechanism that will enable to manage/maintain that view as the change happens on the source data. The changes requested in this ticket, breaks the core design and can allow one to represent/establish a different data view that is not in-line with the source data (a query result view). I don't see need for supporting that kind of behavior in the server side. If Client is not interested to see specific event/operation it should be filtering this out on the client side. \r\n\r\nWhy the need for this behavior?\r\nLooking the Pull Request opened; its not like its avoiding processing of CQs, which is generally more expensive part of having CQ; only thing its avoiding sending the CQ event to client. If this is the behavior client/application is looking for; probably CQ is not the functionality to use.\r\n\r\nAlso, it will be nice to use Request For Change (RFC) process for any issues that has behavior/functional or new API requirements. It will help to get feedback during design phase itself.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/818319699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/818322444","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5774#issuecomment-818322444","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5774","id":818322444,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODMyMjQ0NA==","user":{"login":"agingade","id":8432880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzI4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8432880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade","html_url":"https://github.com/agingade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T00:09:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T00:10:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"From an implementation point of view; this seems to be added/handled in CqQuery as a CqAttributes...\r\nE.g:\r\ninterestedEventsWithQueryOperations = { ALL, CREATE, UPDATE, DESTROY} \r\n\r\nAgain, this doesn't seem to be a generic usecase/requirement that needs to be added into apache Geode, my view.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/818322444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/818369607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6279#issuecomment-818369607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6279","id":818369607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODM2OTYwNw==","user":{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-13T01:43:53Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T01:43:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Running the tests locally, I was able to reproduce the failure.

been thinking about the way we check out a branch in CI and apply the changes. Rather than trying to edit the patch file manually, it might be easier to do the following:\r\n1. Check out the same branch locally as the branch we check out in `execute_redis_tests.sh` (right now we do `git checkout origin/5.0`, but we should consider checking out a specific release tag vs. a branch, since that 5.0 branch is still being updated and changes to the tests might mess up our patch [lines might be different, etc.])\r\n2. Apply the existing patch file\r\n3. Make desired changes\r\n4. Generate a new patch file based on those changes \r\n5.

I've read the ticket and made a first pass over the diffs, but I don't understand why StartLocatorCommandWorkingDirectoryTest and StartServerCommandWorkingDirectoryTest need to be deleted in order to support configurable UDP membership address?\r\n\r\nIt is not needed. Its a code improvement I identified when implementing the functionality. Notice what I wrote on the PR description:\r\n\r\n> I have not squashed the commits of the PR because I think it can be useful for reviewers. The two first commits contains the functionality I mentioned previously, while the three next commits contains some code improvements identified after the review of my first PR for this ticket.\r\n\r\nLong story: I observed that adding a new parameter in `start locator` or `start server` commands had an impact on all tests of `StartLocatorCommandWorkingDirectoryTest` and `StartLocatorCommandWorkingDirectoryTest`. Those tests were just testing the working directory resolution, it has no sense they were impacted. So I refactored that code in `StartLocatorCommand` & `StartServerCommand` extracting the working directory resolution code to a new method to be able to test it independently. You can review just what I changed for this in this commit:\r\n\r\n`4cd39cc Refactor StartMemberUtils.resolveWorkingDir`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/824633211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/824700456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5948#issuecomment-824700456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5948","id":824700456,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDcwMDQ1Ng==","user":{"login":"mivanac","id":48509724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac","html_url":"https://github.com/mivanac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-22T09:49:26Z","updated_at":"2021-04-22T09:49:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If we deploy clients in internal network (for example in the same kubernetes cluster as geode), then for those clients to connect with locator, communication will go from internal network to external, then from external to internal.
