Slim (@b-slim ),\r\n\r\nI am impressed with such a thorough review! Thanks! It looks like the issue of lock-free programming and lock-free memory management is as close to your heart as it is close to mine! This is the reason I did PhD in this field :) I am glad to find an ally! What was your PhD thesis about? I have some answers below. If I understand something wrongly, I would be happy to hear and learn.\r\n\r\n> that is simple not true, some of those locks are part of allocate calls and some are part of iterator loop to do some stuff that i doubt it is static ...\r\n\r\nI would be happy to speak with you about internal Oak implementation. As it is time consuming to discuss it via chat, I suggest us to arrange us an off-line discussion via Hangouts for example. Let me know what time-slots suit you.\r\n\r\n> Looking at the allocator briefly i see bunch of red flags, like possible internal fragmentations up to factor 2 and not clear way to deal with external fragmentations … Memory Management is a very hard thing in general and make it lock free is not going to be simple task .... \r\n\r\nWe're very well aware that the full lock-free Memory Management is a hard thing and actually not available yet. However, the Druid's usage of IncrementalIndex is a restricted one, IMHO. For example, there are no concurrent deletions, thus dealing with internal fragmentation should not be an issue. Dealing with external fragmentation might be an issue of tuning per specific Block size and common workloads. Bottom line, we had no intent to write a perfect general-purpose full lock-free Memory Management, but a specialized memory management. Not to say that it is not final and can be fixed/replaced if some objective issues are found. \r\n\r\n> Writing one form scratch is a common source of bugs, In fact most of the big data projects avoid this task and use the Netty allocator.\r\n\r\nAs you have seen our memory manager and memory allocator is quite restricted. So we believe it can perform faster and it can be easier to find bugs there. Thanks for referring to the Netty Allocator. I have taken a brief look on Netty Allocator, it appears to be based on reference-counting and their underlying data structure is their own ByteBuf (not ByteBuffer). It is assumed that epoch-based GC is more efficient in performance than reference-counting. But mostly important, I am not sure we can convert ByteBuf into ByteBuffer without any complications or performance issues. Nor can we require Druid to start working with Netty ByteBufs. However, we will continue investigation and if Netty Allocator can be used and gives a better performance, no problems to switch to it.\r\n\r\n> The take our of this, current state is not lock free thus lets avoid confusion, (FYI even on the oak github page i do not see it called lock-free so not sure why you are calling it lock free).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking lock-free is about the data structure not about the underlying memory management. As a full lock-free memory management (GC+allocation) isn’t available yet, not any of currently existing lock-free data structures can be called lock-free and neither their performance results are valid… Huge amount of scientific papers wasted :) .  But I will remove the \"lock-free” term from anywhere it appears here.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I am a big fan of lock-free programming, and I will be the first one to fight to eliminate any lock anywhere. But in reality what does matter is the final performance results and in order to see gains from lock-free programming we need big contention of multi-threading, is it the case in Druid’s IncrementalIndex?

Added to 0.15 milestone because If SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus will leak into Druid 0.15 API, it will be much harder to remove it from later\r\n\r\nThis sounds like going back to feature-based release instead of time-based one. Per the [discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/druid-development/QPZUIzLtZ2I/hc3jkMATCgAJ;context-place=searchin/druid-development/roman%7Csort:date) you started, we are trying to freeze code every 3 months. After code freeze, we are backporting only regression bug fixes, security bug fixes, and doc changes if necessary. If you want to talk about a better release policy, please start a discussion on dev mailing list.\r\n\r\nSince this issue is not any of bug fix or doc change, I don't think this issue should be necessarily a blocker for 0.15.0 release. IMO, if it's not done yet before code freeze, it simply should wait for the next release. This is the least controversial way to choose features to add to each release I think. Especially for this issue, even the discussion on the proper solution is still ongoing.\r\n\r\n> Regarding DataSegment's immutability, it might need to go away anyway, as #6358 should be fixed (note @surekhasaharan: you can fix that problem, incl. across Coordinator -> Broker segment streaming, in the same PR). \r\n\r\nI agree the current way that DataSegment is updated and maintained is somewhat unintuitive. However, still I think it's not a good idea to make it immutable. Currently the variables can be updated in DataSegment are `loadSpec` and `size`, and the update happens only one time after the segment created by stream ingestion tasks is published. So, it's not the update of state, but update of metadata.\r\n\r\n`overshadowedStatus` is different. It represents a state of a dataSegment which can have different values depending on the context. This means, the `overshadowedStatus` must be computed correctly before it's used. If it's added to DataSegment as a mutable variable, I guess it would be very confusing unless there is a way to figure out under what context that state was computed.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm also curious about the benefit we can when `DataSegment` becomes mutable. Is there anything else except memory savings?\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't think it's a good idea to recommend to fix several problems in a single PR. It makes the PR complicated which in turn making review harder. I would say, if the author wants to fix several problems in a single PR, I'm ok with that if the PR is not much complicated and large. But, I think simple PRs more likely get reviewed because they are easy to review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494510520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494513344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2320#issuecomment-494513344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2320","id":494513344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDUxMzM0NA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T18:51:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T18:51:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vsharathchandra

Exactly! This is the mostly important! And here we need your input! How does Druid manages Direct memory? Is there some policy? Documentation to read? Pointers to code?\r\n\r\nI don't think there is bunch of docs but in nutshell Druid uses 3 kind of memory resources.\r\n\r\n1.

The entire timeline would be an older snapshot. I think as long as it's not 'surprisingly rolled back' then it is OK. Meaning: no run should use an older snapshot than a prior run.\r\n\r\nWithin any given coordinator leadership epoch, the snapshot at time T will be newer than the snapshot at previous times < T. So avoiding surprising rollbacks really boils down to avoiding a situation where the _new leader_ uses an older snapshot than the _old leader_. I think the best way to avoid this is to make sure that any snapshot used in a given leadership epoch must have been taken after the start of that epoch. (If it was from prior to the start of the epoch, it might be out of date and using it might lead to a surprising rollback.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494654440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494655199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7653#issuecomment-494655199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7653","id":494655199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDY1NTE5OQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T05:15:15Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T05:15:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll take a look at the SQLMetadataSegmentManager changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494655199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494659852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7571#issuecomment-494659852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7571","id":494659852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDY1OTg1Mg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T05:40:41Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T05:40:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Added to 0.15 milestone because If SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus will leak into Druid 0.15 API, it will be much harder to remove it from later (it will require transition PRs through several consecutive Druid versions, and temporary glue code). So I would really like to see it go away before Druid 0.15 if other people agree that needs to be done. Please provide arguments if you disagree.\r\n\r\n@leventov - which API leak are you concerned about? From context I'm guessing it's the HTTP API. I suggest we address that by not documenting it and treating it as an internal API. The info is still exposed through system tables (the original motivation for creating this HTTP API), and that won't change even if we end up wanting to alter the underlying API.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm still not really sure that a mutable DataSegment is the way to go. It just feels wrong. It's a class that is meant to represent the 'payload' in the druid_segments table and the announcement in ZK of an available segment. In my experience these sorts of widely used modeling classes work best when they are immutable. Also, if we added mutable fields like 'isOvershadowed', it would often be invalid (for example: in code that is reading or writing an individual segment announcement in ZK, where the overshadowedness concept does not have meaning).\r\n\r\nBesides, I don't think that having mutable DataSegments would really do too much to reduce churn. DataSegments aren't updated very often. Most are either never updated, or are just updated once (during realtime-to-historical handoff). If someone is doing a deep storage migration they might update all their segments, but this would be quite infrequent. If we use wrappers in situations that want to track extra state, like overshadowedness, then those wrappers could be mutable to avoid churn in the wrappers. (Meaning: we could make SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus mutable.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494659852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494687467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7676#issuecomment-494687467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7676","id":494687467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDY4NzQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"sanastas","id":12136181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTM2MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12136181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas","html_url":"https://github.com/sanastas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanastas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T07:30:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T07:30:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your input!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494687467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/494711696","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7724#issuecomment-494711696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7724","id":494711696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDcxMTY5Ng==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-22T08:44:35Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T08:44:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is happening because the overlord doesn't load lookups and doesn't have a lookup module, and so, it doesn't know about the `lookup` function.

I suggest we address that by not documenting it and treating it as an internal API. \r\n\r\nInternal API cannot be broken either to ensure there is a safe rolling upgrade/downgrade plan. So version 0.16 would need to add alternative implementation while fully supporting the old `SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus`, and only 0.17 can remove `SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think the main reason why I proposed mutable `isOvershadowed` field was that I initially proposed to compute it lazily, on demand in `SQLMetadataSegmentManager`. However, later I agreed ([in this thread](#issuecomment-488330261), actually) that it can also be eager. So I think immutable would work fine.\r\n\r\n> I'm also curious about the benefit we can when DataSegment becomes mutable. Is there anything else except memory savings?\r\n\r\nMemory and concurrency (see #7595).\r\n\r\nSo what about the following:\r\n\r\n - Immutable, but extensible `DataSegment`.\r\n - Immutable `SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus` which extends `DataSegment` (note: they also have different JSON representations).\r\n - Although immutable, both are decidedly *containers*, not \"data classes\". They both prohibit `equals()` and `hashCode()` as described [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6358#issuecomment-489102183).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/495288920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/495289289","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7734#issuecomment-495289289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7734","id":495289289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTI4OTI4OQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T16:24:53Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T16:24:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jihoonson do you mind helping me backport this to 0.15?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/495289289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/495294723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7681#issuecomment-495294723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7681","id":495294723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTI5NDcyMw==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T16:40:42Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T16:40:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lml2468 thanks for the contribution!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/495294723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/495295982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7609#issuecomment-495295982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7609","id":495295982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTI5NTk4Mg==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T16:44:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T16:44:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@sashidhar it looks like there is a collision and @lml2468 has already solved this problem.

I didn't notice this before. This sounds like Both https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7425 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7595 are supposed to be done in a single PR, but they are separate for the sake of convenience of the author and reviewers. And I like to avoid two potential problems in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/7425, i.e., slow API performance and internal API mismatch between versions.

Immutable SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus which extends DataSegment (note: they also have different JSON representations).\r\n\r\nI guess this means we need to get rid of DataSegmentInterner (DataSegment objects cannot be interned effectively if they are being subclassed and have `overshadowed` fields that need to be changed). So we would want to add some other way of sharing objects between the broker's timeline (ServerSelector) and the metadata segment cache (MetadataSegmentView). We could perhaps have those two things store SegmentId objects rather than DataSegment objects, and have them use a shared registry object that stores the actual DataSegments.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some wrinkles here:\r\n\r\n1. The 'shared registry object' would probably be some kind of wrapper around `Map<SegmentId, SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus>`. But when ServerSelector needs to register a DataSegment, it _doesn't have_ a valid overshadowed status. (It's just coming from a segment announcement, not a timeline, and 'overshadowed status' only makes sense in the context of a timeline.)\r\n2. There are not one, but _two_ timelines: the timeline of published segments, and the timeline of available segments. They don't always match up 100%. So in the single SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus object, which timeline is being referred to?\r\n\r\nOne way to answer these questions is:\r\n\r\n1. The 'shared registry' should wrap a `Map<SegmentId, DataSegment>`, where the DataSegments may be SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus or they may be the base class DataSegment. If they are the base class, it means we lack information about overshadowed status (maybe, so far, we've only seen it in a segment announcement). If they are the class SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus, it means we do have that information. We'll need to differentiate with `instanceof` checks.\r\n2. It should refer to the timeline of published segments. (That was the original motivation for introducing all this stuff in the first place.)\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think - @leventov, @surekhasaharan, @jihoonson, @jon-wei?\r\n\r\nBy the way, the JSON representations would just be different in that SegmentWithOvershadowedStatus has some extra fields, right?\r\n\r\n> Although immutable, both are decidedly containers, not \"data classes\". They both prohibit equals() and hashCode() as described here (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6358#issuecomment-489102183).\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by 'prohibit' @leventov? I followed the link, and I don't see a suggestion about prohibiting equals and hashCode. (Just about prohibiting using DataSegments as keys in a map, which seems reasonable, given that _usually_ people probably meant to use
