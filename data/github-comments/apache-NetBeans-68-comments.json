I'll update here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/675569864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/675641365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309#issuecomment-675641365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2309","id":675641365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NTY0MTM2NQ==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-18T18:27:30Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T18:27:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> From my POV we should back it out if we further changes for 12.1\r\n\r\n@matthiasblaesing yes, that is what I meant by my comment - I will definitely back it out _if_ we need changes, but at the moment I'm hopeful that the release branch is OK for the final release.\r\n\r\nThis is assuming I'm correct at quick glance that nothing here will change sig file generation @JaroslavTulach ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/675641365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/675842962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309#issuecomment-675842962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2309","id":675842962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NTg0Mjk2Mg==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-19T04:20:50Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T04:20:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @JaroslavTulach OK. Are you not following dev@?\r\n\r\nI am sorry, I didn't read dev@ recently. I was completely focused on VSCode and elsewhere. Once all this PR checks got green, I integrated without realizing the master is supposed to be frozen. I should be more careful. This is a second time I made such mistake, I should learn my lesson.\r\n\r\nPossibly I was influenced by considering my change just a _robustness fix_ that cannot break anything. Running the diff and eliminating all VSCode specific changes:\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl 'https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/apache/netbeans/pull/2309.diff' \\\r\n  | grep ^diff | grep -v java/java.lsp.server | grep -v nbbuild/misc/prepare-bundles \\\r\n  | cut -f3 -d \" \"\r\na/ide/spi.debugger.ui/src/org/netbeans/modules/debugger/ui/DebuggerManagerListener.java\r\na/java/debugger.jpda.truffle/manifest.mf\r\na/java/debugger.jpda.truffle/nbproject/project.xml\r\na/java/maven/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/api/execute/RunUtils.java\r\na/java/maven/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/execute/cmd/ExecutionEventObject.java\r\na/nbbuild/build.xml\r\na/platform/core.windows/src/org/netbeans/core/windows/services/DialogDisplayerImpl.java\r\n```\r\nleaves us with `isHeadless()` checks:\r\n* [ide/spi.debugger.ui](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309/files#diff-b9c79046b9548364065efd8dd282089d)\r\n* [maven](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309/files#diff-f038edf85db71cd67a5b2a356647847d)\r\n* [core.windows](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309/files#diff-6aff1792e1913ea7946414fd9420635b)\r\n\r\nthese checks shall not influence the release as NetBeans IDE isn't running in headless mode. Then there is another robustness check:\r\n* [IOFolding.isSupported](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309/files#diff-0fc693f406ad5eae6e15b6063d7bdba0)\r\n\r\nit shall not influence NetBeans IDE as NetBeans IDE is using `core.output2` implementation of output window which supports folding. One more robustness check is done in buildsystem:\r\n* [check Packages](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2309/files#diff-fa67ba03971f6d21c0ff2493bf5d922f)\r\n\r\nthat only fixes problem of running `ant tryme` on GraalVM, other JVMs continue to behave the same. And then there is the change of dependencies in `debugger.jpda.truffle` module which replaces strict dependency on `java.kit` with a recommendation. That's the only change that changes some behavior in the NetBeans IDE - however as the `java.kit` is present in the NetBeans IDE the change shall be idempotent.\r\n\r\nWith the robustness fixes in master my [debugging in VSCode branch](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/compare/master...JaroslavTulach:java-lsp-server-debugging-attempt2) is much cleaner. Nice, but poor excuse for the organizational problems my integration causes just before release of 12.1. Once again, please accept my apology.

From my POV our use of the osuosl servers already stretches policy. If we don't need to host ourselves, I'd like to keep it like that. I think it is a reasonable expectation, that maven central and cdnjs both keep up with request, as it is their only reason for living.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/683328472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/683347708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2335#issuecomment-683347708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2335","id":683347708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzM0NzcwOA==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-29T22:16:41Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T22:16:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@matthiasblaesing \r\n\r\n> Is this problem still reproducible for you?\r\n\r\nYes.

I don't feel real need to use the modern Java syntax like `var`, `x = switch`, `instanceof String s`, etc. It is just a syntactic sugar which can be written in JDK8 syntax as well. On the other hand I respect others who want to use modern Java - the syntax is nicer. This PR shows it is possible to have both and that is great to hear!\r\n\r\nHowever more than the new syntax I like the ability to compile against modern Java APIs as described in the \"Systems Paths\" section at the http://frgaal.org web page. I've just tried it in NetBeans and it is enough to put `nbproject/project.properties`:\r\n```\r\njavac.target=11\r\njavac.source=14\r\n```\r\nand then one can use JDK11 APIs. E.g. it is possible to write `Class<?> c = java.lang.Module.class` and the project compiles on JDK8! Moreover join this with existing support for automatically adding `OpenIDE-Module-Java-Dependencies: Java > 11` and I see nirvana: it is possible to have special bridge modules that provide access to future JDK APIs without reflection and that is amazing! \r\n\r\nI don't see much problems adopting this retrofit compiler for Java on an opt-in bases. We know the syntax is going to be supported in JDK14+ - once NetBeans requires JDK17 LTS for compilation, we can drop the special compiler. On the other hand, I prefer a fixed compiler (and especially fixed APIs) to random compiler coming from the JDK - this is how Kotlin is used (e.g. one specifies the version of the compiler in `pom.xml`) and I find it very clever & comfortable. I am not aware of any problems related to JavaScript parser (if anyone felt strongly about it, he would upgrade to newer version of the library, right?) and moreover in this case we are talking only about compile-time dependency. Should everything go in vain, then we rewrite (or rather automatically refactor with [Jackpot](https://netbeans.apache.org/jackpot/index.html)) the code to old patterns.\r\n\r\n+1 to allow opt-in usage of this retrofit compiler to build NetBeans code base. I hope @matthiasblaesing changes his -1 opinion as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/688160644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/688322506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1167#issuecomment-688322506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1167","id":688322506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODMyMjUwNg==","user":{"login":"kishida","id":1178746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzg3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1178746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida","html_url":"https://github.com/kishida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-07T13:21:31Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T13:21:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What is the status?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/688322506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/688326411","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1167#issuecomment-688326411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/1167","id":688326411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODMyNjQxMQ==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-07T13:28:27Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T13:28:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Here: https://github.com/apache/netbeans-l10n\r\n\r\nMaybe, we can close this, I suppose.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/688326411/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/688430002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/291#issuecomment-688430002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/291","id":688430002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODQzMDAwMg==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-07T16:41:53Z","updated_at":"2020-09-07T16:41:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @jlahoda can you rebase this one on the current master, if it is still relevan.
