System busy is a very common situation. If this situation needs to be specified by the user, then our sdk seems difficult to use. In addition, we can easily implement it, why require users to add code by themselves\r\n> \r\n> some rocketmq designers/members/contributors worried about overload, so sdk's build-in retry PR can't be merged long time ago. I think it's ok to use sdk's built in retry if there is no any risk to do this.\r\n\r\nActually，sdk will also retry when broker returns SYSTEM_ERROR. And when the pagecache is busy, the response code is SYSTEM_ERROR. In our internal, RocketMQ has been running for more than two years, and the entire cluster has not been overloaded because of a single Broker's busy, so this worry is unnecessary. Besides, the commercial version also supports retrying in this case, why can't the open-source version support it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1407910843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1407917820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/5951#issuecomment-1407917820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5951","id":1407917820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85T6x78","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-30T02:59:01Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T02:59:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

System busy is a very common situation. If this situation needs to be specified by the user, then our sdk seems difficult to use. In addition, we can easily implement it, why require users to add code by themselves\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > some rocketmq designers/members/contributors worried about overload, so sdk's build-in retry PR can't be merged long time ago. I think it's ok to use sdk's built in retry if there is no any risk to do this.\r\n> \r\n> Actually，sdk will also retry when broker returns SYSTEM_ERROR. And when the pagecache is busy, the response code is SYSTEM_ERROR. In our internal, RocketMQ has been running for more than two years, and the entire cluster has not been overloaded because of a single Broker's busy, so this worry is unnecessary. Besides, the commercial version also supports retrying in this case, why can't the open-source version support it?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, users don't run multi rocketmqs as cluster , they just run one rocketmq/nameserver (considering the cost) ,  I think commercial version  is also a cluster.\r\nI support to use build-in retrying if there is no risk to do this. Could someone make some tests to prove it. \r\nCurrently, I think config is a good choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1408038481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1408302869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/5954#issuecomment-1408302869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/5954","id":1408302869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85T8P8V","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-30T09:53:16Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T09:53:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
