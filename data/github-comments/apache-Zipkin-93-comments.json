I would like the summary listing implemented first and then think about the scattered plot later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/507500022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/507520399","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/2633#issuecomment-507520399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/2633","id":507520399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzUyMDM5OQ==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T05:10:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T05:10:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"maybe just me but it \"feels\" faster.

am presuming you are having a concern with your data as opposed to the\ndisplay of it. it is not a problem or even unusual for sub spans to be\nlonger than their parent.\n\nthe most common reason this can occur is a difference in \"done\" semantics.\nfor example, one side thinks it is done when headers are read and he other\nwhen the body is read.\n\nsince we dont use github issues for general q&a I suggest moving any\nfurther questions to gitter or zipkin-user@googlegroups.com\n\nalso this github repo can only change the server or the ui. if instead you\nthink the data correct, but is being
