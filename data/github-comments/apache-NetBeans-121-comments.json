Things build OK on my machine and these failures do not occur until I push, so it is taking some time to debug. Hopefully these will be resolved soon. Thanks for your time and assistance reviewing.\r\n\r\nHi @mbien is there any way that you can tell exactly what is causing these most recent failures in the \"Commit Validation on Linux/JDK x\" checks?  There does not appear to be an issue directly pertaining to any files I've modified for this PR within the error logs.  I appreciate your time and assistance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1185745310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1185751386","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4378#issuecomment-1185751386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4378","id":1185751386,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5GrSFa","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T17:26:30Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T17:26:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@juneau001 if you see something like \"junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Forked Java VM exited abnormally.\" in the commit validation tests its caused by  #4211 and you can ignore it.

### Apache NetBeans version\r\n> Apache NetBeans 13\r\n> \r\n> ### What happened\r\n> CDI bean is supposed to be found in the xhtml file after typing the \"#{}\" keyword. Also, when ctrl + click on class/ method name of CDI statement in xhtml, the \"go to declaration\" function is not working in the Netbeans IDE.\r\n> \r\n> *Found that the bug can be fixed when turning it back to Jakarta EE 8.0.0 version instead of 9.1.0. Second, change the \"jakarta.xxxx\" back to \"javax.xxxx\" for a temporary fixing.\r\n> \r\n> ### How to reproduce\r\n> Please use the example here to reproduce https://github.com/juneau001/jakarta_cdi_reservations\r\n> \r\n> Open the part 2 project, open the \"reservations.xhtml\" file in Apache Netbean 13 (in fact, it is also happen in version 12).\r\n> \r\n> <p:inputText id=\"firstName\" value=\"#{reservationController.currentReservation.firstName}\"/>\r\n> \r\n> When you ctrl + click on the \"currentReservation\" or \"firstName\", Netbeans not able to \"go to declaration\".\r\n> \r\n> Besides, when type the \"#{}\" the CDI bean is not even found in the list as captured below:\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53899971/165225760-f18f1590-ba9d-41c8-8528-653a4e6645d6.png)\r\n> \r\n> I believe a similar error is like the following: https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=178687\r\n> \r\n> Lastly, the workaround is to change the Jakarta EE version from 9.1.0 back to 8.0.0 and change the \"jakarta.xxxx\" to \"javax.xxxx\" for all java files. This works but defeats the purpose, please take note.\r\n> \r\n> I hope this bug can be solved very soon as this already spent me a long time to try and error.
