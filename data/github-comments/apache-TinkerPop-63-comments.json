For me the concern is partly about wasted MBs in a docker image (only about 12MB, but it counts), and partly about wanting to keep misleading clutter out of automatically generated licensing info. I don't want to say, \"This software uses packages X, Y, and Z\" if it doesn't actually use them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I realize the problem is really not with `gremlinpython` per se, but is fundamentally about needing better control over pip and dependency resolution.

Its HTTP handler makes the requests to timeout after some time, causing the connection error I need. Then a timer is used to identify the deadlock. Is it an overkill?\r\n\r\nGiven that the issue involves `(*gremlinServerWSProtocol).readLoop`, `(*connection).errorCallback`and `(*gremlinServerWSProtocol).close`, I'm not sure if a unit test fits well here. @simonz-bq you are more familiar with the code, what do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1171603678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1171715829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1734#issuecomment-1171715829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1734","id":1171715829,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5F1vb1","user":{"login":"simonz-bq","id":42222408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjIyNDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42222408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq","html_url":"https://github.com/simonz-bq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonz-bq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-30T21:54:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T21:54:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jroimartin I'm not a committer to have much weight in my opinion, but from my point of view in reality the server can malfunction in a myriad of ways, many of which are not replicable to test via code since the malfunctions are not triggerable via code.
