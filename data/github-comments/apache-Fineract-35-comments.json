Hi @BLasan - thanks for attempting this, but resolving this issue is a bit more complicated than just removing the offending lines as the calls to rs.previous() are there for a reason:\r\n> \r\n> Currently the called function takes the ResultSet and extracts data until it finds a row that doesn't belong with the others. Then it reverses the cursor by 1 row with rs.previous(). That way when the control returns to the calling function, the cursor is set so that the calling function gets the first row of the next group by calling rs.next().\r\n> \r\n> If we just remove the rs.previous(), then calling rs.next() in the calling function will give us the _second_ row of the next group, as we have already consumed the first row within the called function.\r\n> \r\n> So one way to solve this would be to \"flatten\" the functions so that all work with the ResultSet is in same function - so that there is no need to pass rs.previous(). But to ensure that the \"flattening\" doesn't change the behaviour, it would be good to first have a test case which checks the functionality. Then when we refactor the function, we can ensure we haven't broken the functionality.\r\n> \r\n> Hope this helps...\r\n\r\nHi. Please refer this. As far as know, initially it does not point to the first row of the selected data.
