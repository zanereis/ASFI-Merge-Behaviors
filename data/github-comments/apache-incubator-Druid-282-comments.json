The result of the random expression will be potentially cached at query time. Fixing this means adding an `isCacheable` method to all expressions.\r\n2. At ingest time, if you use this in a `transformSpec`, it makes the results of ingestion nondeterministic. This will cause haywire with Kafka index task replicas. Fixing it probably requires creating a per-partition seed ahead of time on the supervisor and sharing it across tasks.\r\n\r\nThese issues can be overcome, but, it doesn't seem worth it at this time.

@abk-code,\r\n\r\nThe lowest replication you can set is 1.

However, Druid uses zookeeper to discover if a new historical has joined the cluster. So as soon an a historical reports its existence to zookeeper (or to the coordinator if http announcement is configured), then the brokers think that the historical is ready for use and will start sending queries to it. However, those queries will not arrive at those historicals unless their readiness healthcheck has also passed already. So there is this intermittent timespan during which a broker cannot reach a historical and during this time all queries will fail because the broker will keep contacting the same historical, even if query-retries are configured. On retry, the same historical gets picked.\r\n\r\nI was wandering how to improve this behaviour during rolling updates.\r\n\r\n* One improvement would be to have the broker graylist a failing historical during retries.\r\n\r\n* Another improvement would be to add a configurable delay \"druid.server.http.announcePropagationDelay\" such that after a zookeeper announcement of a newly joined service (e.g. historical), there would be some delay until other services (e.g. brokers) would start to interact with the joined service. This would be similar to the existing property \"druid.server.http.unannouncePropagationDelay\"\r\nThe purpose of this would be that if Kubernetes is set up to execute a readiness check every 30 seconds, one could set the announcePropagationDelay to a larger time like 45 seconds, so that there would be no situation in which one Druid service tries to talk to another one at a time when Kubernetes is not (yet) allowing incoming traffic to the latter service.\r\n\r\nI just meant to mention it in this place because when I saw the title of this PR, especially the \"having initialization delays\" I hoped that the PR would also be about adding this internal delay.\r\n\r\nI have so far not found another workaround in kubernetes yet. It is certainly foremost a weakness in kubernetes that causes this misbehaviour because the readiness concept violates the single-responsibilty principle. A readiness check is used for two things:\r\na) to decide whether incoming network connections are allowed for a given pod\r\nb) to decide whether a rolling update can already continue updating the next pod\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there seems to be no way to have separate timings for these two unrelated aspects in k8s. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/551945335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/551957897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8728#issuecomment-551957897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8728","id":551957897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MTk1Nzg5Nw==","user":{"login":"palanieppan-m","id":27789414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg5NDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27789414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m","html_url":"https://github.com/palanieppan-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palanieppan-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-08T19:23:34Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T19:23:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kstrempel we looked into join support through presto couple years ago. \r\n\r\nIts possible but presto connector interface did not have API to push down predicates.
