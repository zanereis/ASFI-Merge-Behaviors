As you commented, the index size is quite large, although the index is built for only one column. \n\nFurthermore, I used a straight forward approach to utilize the current bst index implementation. That is, multiple bst index files are created for each hdfs block, and stored in HDFS. This may cause remote accesses during index scan. \n\nAfter finishing this issue, we can discuss the required features related to the next generation index structure. \n\nSincerely,\nJihoon\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/58456061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/58462447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/196#issuecomment-58462447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/196","id":58462447,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NDYyNDQ3","user":{"login":"hyunsik","id":225941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/225941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunsik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunsik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-09T04:38:28Z","updated_at":"2014-10-09T04:38:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It has a wrong issue number.

The use of former function adds unnecessary package dependency while System.currentTimeMillis() is also used in many other places in Tajo source code. \"isReady\" is intentionally omitted somewhere because it is not related to the real content of a histogram.

Your advice is to use NumericDatum (not Datum) instead of Double. In Tajo, NumericDatum represents INTx and FLOATx. I think that Double can cover a broader range of numeric values, not only int and float, but also boolean, bit, datetime, and char. Because the data is big, the sample data is big, too (if you take too small samples, the accuracy will be too low). Meanwhile, a table may contain hundreds of columns, each of which needs to construct a separate histogram. Hence, histogram construction time can be very long and we should alleviate this burden by using simple data type, such as Double instead of NumericDatum (or Datum). Data type conversion from Datum to Double can be done by a utility function.\n\nequi-width and equi-depth are simple histograms, thus obtain not-so-great estimation accuracy. When you want to improve the accuracy of selectivity estimation by implementing more complex histograms in the future (for example, multidimensional histograms - to catch the dependencies of data between different columns), you will see that histogram construction time is a real problem. So, it'd be better to keep it simple.\n\nFor a fast extension, TEXT can be approximately mapped to a numerical value, too. For more complex types (including TEXT if you wish), in my opinion, Tajo needs a special treatment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/59173282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/59176888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/200#issuecomment-59176888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/200","id":59176888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MTc2ODg4","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-15T09:01:37Z","updated_at":"2014-10-15T09:01:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mvhlong sorry for confusing.\nI first intended that using NumericDatum will be useful for the later histogram extension.\nHowever, you are right.

I already fixed many bugs of sort bugs caused by long text value (up to 256 bytes). For ETL workloads, it is usual. Also, can Double represent an entire Long range? We need to check it.

However, because it will take too long time, people often take a sample of the data and create a histogram based on this sample. When the sampling ratio is low, the histogram based on this sample will have low selectivity estimation accuracy. In contrast, when the sampling ratio is high, the histogram will have high estimation accuracy (samplingRatio = 100% means that we use the full column data). So, we will want to build a histogram based on a big sample (i.e., high sampling ratio). But, this may lead to a significant increase in histogram construction time. Consequently, we will want to reduce the time by using simple data structures instead of complex ones.\n\nI checked the classes Long and Double. Double cannot represent the entire value range of Long, thus a histogram built on Double cannot replace another one built for Long. This is my mistake in making a careless assumption.\n\nAfter reading your comments, I have thought a lot more about the supporting of other data types in histograms. Now, I think that I should use Datum since it is the only way to make a unified and clean implementation, although it takes longer processing time. In HistogramBucketProto, min and max will be changed from \"double\" to \"bytes\".

However, with this change, the histogram module can be extended to support other data types easily in the future.\n\nWith the use of Datum, in contrast to my assumption, the histogram construction time is not slower in the tests. This is good for us.\n\nWith a single histogram idea (for example, equi-width), I prefer to make only 1 implementation for all data types rather than to make 3 different versions for Long, Double, and byte[]. This makes the source code clean and easy for maintenance. Anyway, with the latest update, this problem has been solved.\n\nCurrently, the histogram implementation takes a list of Datum values. You are right that it takes all values at a time. Building a histogram in an completely incremental way is difficult because many histograms require the sort of all data points. So, I think that we should build the histograms in a _partially_ incremental way. More specifically, we first build many histograms with many different samples, then _merge_ them.

The patch looks really great. I love your design.\n\nActually, I didn't mention how we validate each config key. Of course, it is out of scope of this issue. Now, I just share it with you.\n\nIn my plan, Tajo will validate configs in two ways.\n\nThe first way is that TajoMaster validates each config when it starts up. If TajoMaster finds invalid config which probably will cause query runtime errors, TajoMaster will shutdown immediately and prints out detailed error messages. If so, we can earlier prohibit some kind of query runtime errors.\n\nThe second one is that TajoMaster checks each session setting action by client. If a client sets an invalid session variable, it will show some errors and prohibit putting the invalid variable into session variables.\n\nIf you fix the validator for `tajo.username` and rebase it, I'll finish the review.\n\nBest regards,\nHyunsik\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/60473494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/60475843","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/210#issuecomment-60475843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/210","id":60475843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDc1ODQz","user":{"login":"babokim","id":321821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim","html_url":"https://github.com/babokim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babokim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-25T08:30:24Z","updated_at":"2014-10-25T08:30:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\nThis patch is needed quickly for implementation hbase storage. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/60475843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/60477837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/192#issuecomment-60477837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/192","id":60477837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDc3ODM3","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-25T10:04:22Z","updated_at":"2014-10-25T10:04:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your comment.\nAs you said, it will be interesting to evaluate the performance with varying the selectivity. \nBut, I'm sorry to say that nowadays I have little time to perform performance tests.\nMaybe, I can do it next month.

However, with your explanation, I feel that TajoMaster will throw exceptions, not TajoConf. I just wonder if I correctly understand your strategy.\n\nHi @ykrips,\n\nThank you for your work again! I leave comments here for your question in #206.\n\nThe main reason why TajoMaster needs to check all configs is that we need to limit the scope of runtime exception.\n\nThe background is as follows:\n- TajoConf is a subclass of Hadoop Configuration.\n- Configuration loads `*-site.xml` and `*-default.xml` in Java classpaths when it is initialized.\n  - Coniguration internally will use set(String, String) when it initialized.\n- According to our policy of TajoConf usage, we **do not modify any config in runtime** except for unit tests.\n  - In other words, they are constant configs loaded when Tajo cluster starts up.\n- As a result, validateProperty() will be mostly used when TajoConf is initialized.\n\nConsequently, we need to handle exception thrown by the constructor of TajoConf. TajoConf is initialized in lots of parts, and exception handling against constructor may be not good in my opinion.\n\nIn my view. it would be enough to validate configs in three entry points of TajoMaster, TajoWorker and TajoClient. They are main components in a Tajo cluster.  (In previous, I mentioned only TajoMaster. We actually need config validation in two more components.)\n\nLater, we can improve three components (TajoMaster, TajoWorker, and TajoClient) to have some diagnose phase to check all configs, connectivities among Tajo components and states of components. Your proposed patch would be a part of the diagnose phase.\n\nThanks,\nHyunsik\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/60572743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/60580810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/214#issuecomment-60580810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/214","id":60580810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTgwODEw","user":{"login":"ykrips","id":8876874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzY4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips","html_url":"https://github.com/ykrips","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ykrips/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-27T11:45:39Z","updated_at":"2014-10-27T11:45:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@hyunsik , Thank you for clarifying my understandings on this validator design.
