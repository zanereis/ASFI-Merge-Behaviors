At the same time that doesn't really sound very appealing somehow :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/246216364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/246585579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/120#issuecomment-246585579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/120","id":246585579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjU4NTU3OQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-13T06:16:36Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T06:16:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've made a couple of changes to this PR today and to make it easier for people to review the webapp not just from a code perspective, but also from a user perspective, I've published my local build as a docker image on Docker Hub:\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/kaspersor/metamodel/\n\nFeedback very much appreciated, and especially some kind of idea of whether you think we should add this application to MetaModel in the first place?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/246585579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/247313812","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/129#issuecomment-247313812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/129","id":247313812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzMxMzgxMg==","user":{"login":"LosD","id":1282832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD","html_url":"https://github.com/LosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T12:25:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T12:25:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis error seems unrelated.

The individual databases will exist elsewhere (maybe as other docker apps, but that's besides the point) but the thing that MM brings to the table is a way to discover them all and use them via a single interface that applies to them all. A common denominator (with all the bad stuff that that means), and a unification layer too. If that is the \"thing it does\" then it is really still a microservice approach to the webapp to have the collection since if it didn't have a collection there would only be a common denominator of one, and that wouldn't improve anything really?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/250786046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/250794254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/120#issuecomment-250794254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/120","id":250794254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDc5NDI1NA==","user":{"login":"LosD","id":1282832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD","html_url":"https://github.com/LosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-30T16:46:38Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T16:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmmmm, good point.\n\nThe thing is that if it is in a cluster, it's hard to get the docker image on the same instance (or even rack) as all the DBs it provides access to when there's many of them, and that means that for chatty apps the indirection of MM can become quite expensive.\n\nOTOH, chatty apps are often a symptom of bad app or DB design (though there is of course cases where it is unavoidable).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/250794254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/252468634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/132#issuecomment-252468634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/132","id":252468634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQ2ODYzNA==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-09T06:50:04Z","updated_at":"2016-10-09T06:50:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The code looks good to me, but I did not verify on any actual DB.

so I have been going over this in my mind again and again a few times. Couldn't quite make myself remove the tenant concept either :-P At least I feel it needs a bit more thought. One of the things I like about it in a URL pattern like `/{tenant}/{datastore}`is that it allows for simple authorization schemes to grant access to `/{some-tenant}/*` and thereby make someone a tenant administator. Similarly of course a particular datastore could be authorized by using the URL pattern. Not having any such \"outer collection name\" means that setting up access rules becomes a lot more difficult. Whether it is tenant or some other grouping term I don't mind so much. It just feels like a big aid in organizing the catalog of datastores.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/254026179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/256541518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/134#issuecomment-256541518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/134","id":256541518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjU0MTUxOA==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T04:04:52Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T04:04:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll merge based on lazy consensus.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/256541518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/256588376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/134#issuecomment-256588376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/134","id":256588376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjU4ODM3Ng==","user":{"login":"LosD","id":1282832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD","html_url":"https://github.com/LosD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LosD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T09:09:26Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T10:11:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Weird.

One way is with the `NegationOperator` which is in a way nice and general, but introduces some redundancy since there are also operators available for \"different from\". And it is made more obvious with the other solution that you introduce at the same time: Introducing the \"not in\" operator. Honestly I think that from an API evolution point of view, the second approach (\"not in\" operator) is the best. Introducing a new generic concept like negation into FilterItem is going to have a lot more side-effects on existing query evaluation.

It would implicitly introduce a ton of bugs because data contexts out there would no longer execute queries correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/271195853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/271334523","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/139#issuecomment-271334523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/139","id":271334523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTMzNDUyMw==","user":{"login":"rposkocil","id":13236988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjM2OTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13236988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil","html_url":"https://github.com/rposkocil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rposkocil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-09T16:37:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T16:37:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was thinking about it and for a complete option to be able to express all, what propositional logic allows, it should be enough so that we will add NOT IN and NOT LIKE operators.
