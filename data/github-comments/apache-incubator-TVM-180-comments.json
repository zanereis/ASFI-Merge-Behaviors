Could you explain further about why the current solution will pass constants between partitions?

So the operator itself goes into a target partition whereas the constants remain in the default partition and are then passed to the target partition as arguments.\r\n\r\nTo see this, I can continue to run the test case through partition graph both with and without this change. Without the change:\r\n```\r\ndef @const_test_0(%const_test_0_i0: (Tensor[(10, 10), uint8], Tensor[(10, 10), uint8]), %const_test_0_i1: (float32, float32), %const_test_0_i2: (int32, int32), Inline=1, Compiler=\"const_test\", global_symbol=\"const_test_0\", Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] {\r\n  qnn.concatenate(%const_test_0_i0, %const_test_0_i1, %const_test_0_i2, 0f /* ty=float32 */, 1 /* ty=int32 */, axis=1) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] */\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @main(%a: Tensor[(10, 10), uint8], %b: Tensor[(10, 10), uint8]) -> Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] {\r\n  %0 = abs(%a) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), uint8] */;\r\n  %1 = (%0, %b);\r\n  %2 = (0f /* ty=float32 */, 0f /* ty=float32 */);\r\n  %3 = (1 /* ty=int32 */, 1 /* ty=int32 */);\r\n  @const_test_0(%1, %2, %3) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the change:\r\n```\r\ndef @const_test_0(%const_test_0_i0: (Tensor[(10, 10), uint8], Tensor[(10, 10), uint8]), Inline=1, Compiler=\"const_test\", global_symbol=\"const_test_0\", Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] {\r\n  %0 = (0f /* ty=float32 */, 0f /* ty=float32 */);\r\n  %1 = (1 /* ty=int32 */, 1 /* ty=int32 */);\r\n  qnn.concatenate(%const_test_0_i0, %0, %1, 0f /* ty=float32 */, 1 /* ty=int32 */, axis=1) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] */\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @main(%a: Tensor[(10, 10), uint8], %b: Tensor[(10, 10), uint8]) -> Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] {\r\n  %2 = abs(%a) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 10), uint8] */;\r\n  %3 = (%2, %b);\r\n  @const_test_0(%3) /* ty=Tensor[(10, 20), uint8] */\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'll add this as an explicit test case in the graph partition tests.\r\n\r\nThe reason I've chosen to just omit the annotations for constants altogether is that the requirement for MergeCompilerRegions is that all dataflow paths are annotated. As constants are just data with no flow, they can be considered as part of the operator which consumes them for the purposes of the analysis done in that pass.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/618290965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/618348796","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4953#issuecomment-618348796","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4953","id":618348796,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODM0ODc5Ng==","user":{"login":"trivialfis","id":16746409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ2NDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16746409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis","html_url":"https://github.com/trivialfis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trivialfis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T11:30:32Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T11:33:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@hcho3 I found the cause:\r\n\r\nThe `dmlc::Error` is from `libtvm.so` instead of `libxgboost.so`, which can not be caught by XGBoost.

For my modest arm dev board environments, where i want/need to run tests, docker just isn't viable.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly a very interesting orthogonal question as we would need to figure out how best to run things cross as not every single python package tvm depends on is available natively on AArch32 or

I see your point. I missed considering that `ConstantNode` is also a \"node\" instead of a \"var\". I agree with you that constant nodes should follow the target of the consuming node and the output you illustrated makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it'd be better to maintain the statement of \"annotating every node\" of `AnnotateTarget` pass in my opinion. A similar case is `TupleNode`. We determine the target of tuple nodes by looking at its arguments, and still annotate it whatever it should be at the TVM or other targets. In summary, I'd prefer the following annotation generated by `AnnotateTarget`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput\r\n  |\r\nbegin\r\n  |\r\n op -- begin -- end -- const -- begin\r\n  |\r\n end\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough just like you pointed out that constant node is not in dataflow path, I still prefer to simplify the process in a pass. This can not only naturally guarantee that this change will not affect the rest BYOC flow, but also make the future maintenance easier.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/618537434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/618551683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5423#issuecomment-618551683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5423","id":618551683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODU1MTY4Mw==","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T17:56:49Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T17:56:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am a bit concerned about the current strategy that we allocate the exact number of children slots: A third party library may inherit some of those objects, which makes their #children increase.
