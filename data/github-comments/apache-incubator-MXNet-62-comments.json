all the three example runs (mnist, cifar, lstm). Basically now `Module` serves as a drop-in replacement of `FeedForward`.

Because I do not have environment to test, I'm postponing this. Or maybe @mli could add the functionality later on. But I am expecting the old `FeedForward` module to co-exist for a long time.

If you want to use symbolic API, then it is the same as before (as @tqchen 's example shows, we use attributes to hint which part should be computed on which gpu). What module api makes it easier is imperative api. For example, (after we add some sequential container module) we can define two parts of the network directly as two different symbols and the container will be able to chain the two modules, so model parallel is implemented.\n\nIn general imperative API will be slightly less efficient because memory optimization can only be carried within one atomic module. And there will be state copying cost. But I guess for model parallel those cannot be avoided even with pure symbolic API. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/208703774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/208757932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/1818#issuecomment-208757932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1818","id":208757932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODc1NzkzMg==","user":{"login":"lisabug","id":5773210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzMyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5773210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug","html_url":"https://github.com/lisabug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lisabug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T07:39:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T07:39:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen @pluskid\nI'm sorry I missed a important reason why is neuraltalk2 is fast.\nIn neuraltalk2, input consists one images and five correspond sentences.

According to Issues #1514 @piiswrong says 2X upsampling can directly be done through using kernel = (4,4) and stride = (2,2) , is that true ? I am looking forward to construct a very simple Convolution - Pooling (downsample by two) -> Convolution - Pooling (Downsample by two) -> Special convolutions (similar to fc6 , fc7 in fcnxs to represent fully connected layer) -> Deconv (upsample by 2) -> Deconv (upsample by 2) -> SoftmaxOutput (Segmentation) ? and I am not sure how to do unpooling or upsampling for deconvolution layer ? Can you just chime in your ideas ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209200170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209203780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1838#issuecomment-209203780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1838","id":209203780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTIwMzc4MA==","user":{"login":"Ldpe2G","id":2424744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ3NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2424744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G","html_url":"https://github.com/Ldpe2G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ldpe2G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T02:55:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T02:55:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can refer to  this example:\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/train_model.py\nline 72\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209203780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/209204756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1838#issuecomment-209204756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1838","id":209204756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwOTIwNDc1Ng==","user":{"login":"dushoufu","id":8800132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDAxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8800132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu","html_url":"https://github.com/dushoufu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushoufu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-13T03:01:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T03:01:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@Ldpe2G \nDo you mean like the blow?
