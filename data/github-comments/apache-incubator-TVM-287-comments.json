This is especially true since whenever we want speed we trade accuracy which can sometimes become a problem.\r\n\r\nFor the defaults I envision that for most ops we don't accumulate to FP32. For some ops like the global pools and sums we might turn it on. Really the best way to determine the criteria is to do a lot of the work you've been doing in trying out different models in different applications and seeing what needs to be turned on and off.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this is really designed to be a tool which requires the user sometimes to go back and modify the default values provided to either get more speed if their model can afford it, or accuracy if they need it. It requires investigation and I don't think we can probably hit all cases well. A tutorial here would help  (which is on my long list of TODOs).\r\n\r\nFinally, while things are done on a per-op basis, the actual mixed precision function can look at some parts of the relay call like the attributes or the node or the input tensor sizes. Therefore we can be smart about the quantization (e.g. for global pooling, only accumulate in fp32 if the input to output reduction is large enough). Again, a tutorial or example would help flesh this out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913440596/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913449611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8374#issuecomment-913449611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8374","id":913449611,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ciKL","user":{"login":"GoodNight-bye","id":66587509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTg3NTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66587509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye","html_url":"https://github.com/GoodNight-bye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoodNight-bye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T08:22:30Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T08:22:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Thanks for reporting this.

I'm not sure whether my test case will run successfully on the CI machines with unknown stack size although after adding this PR, because recently I also found that with the loop times increases to a much bigger number, some other Passes will also encounter segmentation faults. For example, when the loop times is set to 1000, the LabelOps encounters stack overflow due to the recursive LetNode VisitExpr_ function. After adding this PR, the fault disappears, but when the loop times is set to 3000 or bigger, other passes will encounter unknown segmentation fault. Therefore, It may be difficult to set the loop times in the test case that only test the LabelOps without triggering other Passes' faults on the CI machine, because the specific loop times is also relative to the stack size. I hope this PR will help to strength the LabelOps Pass, and I will also take time to try to fix segmentation fault caused by other passes in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913484800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913698012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8930#issuecomment-913698012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8930","id":913698012,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42dezc","user":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T14:38:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T14:38:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"please fix ci error","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913698012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913698285","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8928#issuecomment-913698285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8928","id":913698285,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42de3t","user":{"login":"Mousius","id":4933431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzM0MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4933431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius","html_url":"https://github.com/Mousius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mousius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T14:39:13Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T14:39:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913698285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/913712464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8878#issuecomment-913712464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8878","id":913712464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42diVQ","user":{"login":"BBuf","id":35585791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTg1Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35585791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf","html_url":"https://github.com/BBuf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BBuf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-06T15:02:40Z","updated_at":"2021-09-06T15:02:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrushao1994 Hello, can I get more suggestions for this pr?

The bug seems critical, but why didn't I encounter any unexpected error when I tried several cross-thread reduction demos (including softmax) before?\r\n\r\n@MasterJH5574 yeah this is an interesting question. I think this bug manifest only if the following two conditions are met:\r\n1. Reduction op should be followed by elemwise ops at topi level. This applies to softmax, but not to other reduction ops like `sum`, `mean` etc since we apparently don't fuse reduction ops with elemwise ops at Relay level.\r\n2. Topi reduction + elemwise ops should be followed by another elemwise ops. Softmax alone doesn't hit this error because the next compute of softmax summation is the output of softmax itself, which will not be affected by `StorageRewrite`. However, if softmax is fused by other elemwise ops, the original storage for the softmax output can become an intermediate, local storage, which can be rewritten by `StorageRewrite` pass. The test case added in this PR trigger this behavior. Originally, I found this bug when I was working on making softmax op fusbile https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8909.

I think `micro_board` is a good option too. Initially I tried to avoid using `micro_board` term since Zephyr used board and I wanted to make sure we can differentiate those. But now that I think of it we could have micro_board which maps to (target, zephyr_board) in case of Zephyr and (target, arduino_board) in case of Arduino. Based on my understanding, \"board\" is unique in terms of TVM and microTVM so it shouldn't be confusing with another thing.\r\n\r\nI'll be happy to get more opinion on this before changing it to `micro_board`. cc @areusch @guberti @manupa-arm @leandron @Mousius ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/914000441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/914032938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8928#issuecomment-914032938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8928","id":914032938,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ewkq","user":{"login":"Johnson9009","id":19802523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODAyNTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19802523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009","html_url":"https://github.com/Johnson9009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T06:38:25Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T06:38:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/914032938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/914046683","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8931#issuecomment-914046683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8931","id":914046683,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM42ez7b","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-07T07:04:58Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T07:04:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@masahi Got it.

chatted a bit more with @mehrdadh about the question of how to represent the (target, arduino_board) or (target, zephyr_board) pairs. It sort of seems like the neatest solution is to place the mapping in `microtvm_api_server.py` and make `server_info_query` return a suggested `target` based on the ProjectOption provided by the user to e.g. `tvmc`. My hesitations in doing this are:\r\n\r\n1. right now Project API is entirely \"downstream\" of TVM--it just consumes a specified artifact of TVM and doesn't configure TVM. doing this would change that relationship. this means if TVM e.g. evolves the defintion of target to split it into pieces, Project API implementations may need to be updated. I'm not sure this is a big deal, but it's something to think on.\r\n2. Since we would likely move the `tvm.target.micro` shorthands into Project API servers, it means that all platforms are suggested to make a Project API implementation even if they don't use the project generator. This wouldn't be required, though--you could still specify the target the old-fashioend way. it just could be a burden in some cases. we could always alleviate it by allowing platforms to create something specific to them.\r\n\r\nright now this is essentially test configuration.
