I tracked one instance of a non-joined thread to the HTTPLookupService owning the ExecutorServiceProvider that it posts its own work onto. Now the provider it uses is owned by the ClientImpl, but this just exposed a different non-joined thread caused by the ClientImpl itself being destroyed on the ExecutorService worker thread. [Here is the callstack](https://gist.github.com/heronr/ace7f608077441effffa52830ab1f877)\r\n\r\nUltimately because shared_ptrs are being used to manage the lifetime of objects that then post work to ExecutorServices owned by those same objects, we can encounter a non-joinable thread since there is not fine control over when the ref count goes to 0.\r\n\r\nIf we can designate the pulsar::Client as non-copyable then its destructor can force a shutdown() on the ClientImpl and ensure that all outstanding worker threads are joined at that point as a result. The latest exception that I linked stems from the fact that if a pulsar::Client is destructed without first calling shutdown, any outstanding work on an ExecutorService thread will likely result in the destruction of the ClientImpl on that thread and make it impossible to join.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/585081103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/585092750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/6306#issuecomment-585092750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/6306","id":585092750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTA5Mjc1MA==","user":{"login":"devinbost","id":7418031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTgwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost","html_url":"https://github.com/devinbost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T08:38:10Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T08:38:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is the assertion that's failing:\r\n`assertEquals(messageCountNoAck + messageCountYesAck, totalMessages);`\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `totalMessages` is 20, but the total of counted messages (i.e. messages not acked + messages acked) adds up to more than 20.

I just can't help but feel like it's a workaround solution that sweeps the underlying problem under the rug. \r\nThat being said, for the purposes of this PR I will go ahead and use std::thread::detach() to remove the deadlock. I will revisit this later with a (hopefully) better solution.

However, there are a few major comments I would like to clarify here.\r\n\r\n1) we should be consistent using the name across the client, broker and storage layers. I think we should call the bitmap `ack_set` at client and broker layers. but we should call it `delete_set` at the storage layer (ML part).\r\n\r\n2) bookkeeper has a good implementation of `WriteSet` and `AckSet` that leverage netty recycle objects. we should leverage that implementation.

Either way, I've touched a large number of tests, so it's going to be time-consuming to review the code changes in any case.
