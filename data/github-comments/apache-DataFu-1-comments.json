@benraha ,\r\n\r\nAfter you opened this PR I managed to get our GitHub to build and test for different versions of Spark and Scala, and I tried your code out locally. It looks like it doesn't pass compilation in Spark 2.1.x, which we support. But since Spark 2.1.x is so old, I'm willing to merge your PR and drop support for it.\r\n\r\nI will ask about this in our dev discussion group.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/issues/comments/1193678064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/issues/comments/1193757464","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/datafu/pull/27#issuecomment-1193757464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/issues/27","id":1193757464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPKMos5HJ0sY","user":{"login":"eyala","id":883256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/883256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala","html_url":"https://github.com/eyala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eyala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T08:40:59Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T08:40:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.
