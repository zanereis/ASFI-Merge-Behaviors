Assuming that Spark's version of Kafka is indistinguishable to users from the Beam version of KafkaIO, it is nice to not need to change your pipeline when changing runners.\n\nIf Spark does not support `UnboundedSource` and can't do so quickly, this is a good solution. Even once Spark does support the API, it may still be better for users to override to the Spark-native solution if that brings much better performance (and as long as it is indistinguishable to users. If this is not the case, probably better to use the `UnboundedSource` implementation and log? rather than ignore silently or fail).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/240008773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/240011138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/796#issuecomment-240011138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/796","id":240011138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDAxMTEzOA==","user":{"login":"vikkyrk","id":1114748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1114748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk","html_url":"https://github.com/vikkyrk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikkyrk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T06:06:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T06:06:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was waiting for the rest of the datastore changes to get done, so that its easier to get this right in one shot.

And it fails because it does not exist. \n\nOne way to fix this would be to have an empty `target` directory in the root (`sdks/python`). However I do not think that is the best option.\n\nRemoving the custom override for `egg_base` enables things. It also creates a new artifact (directory)  in the root called `apache_beam_sdk.egg-info`. This also can be improved by removing the overrides in `tox` config. By removing them we force that and all the testing related intermediate files to packed under `.tox` folder. We are trading one artifact folder with another.\n\nAlso note that with or without this change not everything is under the `target` folder, there is another artifact created by this process called `nose-1.3.7-py2.7.egg`.\n\nMy argument is it is better to not have config overrides, and have an additional `.tox` directory created as part of the `tox` run. We can improve the cleanup stage by removing `.tox` folder after executing `tox`. After all that directory is only used as the working directory by `tox` and does not have value beyond that.\n\nAfter this change a `target` folder is still created, that contains the binary package.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/240252623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/240253126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/812#issuecomment-240253126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/812","id":240253126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDI1MzEyNg==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-16T21:59:59Z","updated_at":"2016-08-16T22:00:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, PTAL.

No, ParameterizedType seems like the right type it should be unless the method was defined with a rawtype (List vs List<String>) or wildcard or typevariable.\n- Yes, the whole point is that you want to deserialize a ValueProvider. In the deserializer for the ValueProvider you need to use the requested type to pulling out the parameterized type to lookup the deserializer which you invoke and then wrap the result in a ValueProvider. Very similar to how our coders have component coders that are used to decode the internal type.\n- Worker options are set at startup in Dataflow, can't assume how the system works everywhere.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/240766563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/240784153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/827#issuecomment-240784153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/827","id":240784153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDc4NDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"sammcveety","id":2364801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjQ4MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2364801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety","html_url":"https://github.com/sammcveety","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sammcveety/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T16:46:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T16:46:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I added a skeleton for the (de)serializer, but I'm not clear on where it would get the type information in the same way.
