As I understand it, it makes the Kafka consumer commit the messages it has received from poll() every so often. That means that messages can be lost if they've been pulled out of the consumer, but the topology hasn't acked them yet. If you disable auto commit, the messages will instead be committed when the topology acks them.\n\nI can't reproduce this issue. Here are the steps I took:\n\n1) Do a fresh install of Kafka 0.9.0.1\n2) Do a fresh install of Storm 1.0.1, start Nimbus and 1 supervisor on localhost\n3) Create a 1 partition topic on a newly installed 0.9.0.1 Kafka broker\n4) Deploy a topology containing only the Kafka spout and a bolt printing the messages it receives to system.out.\n5) Send 5 messages to Kafka using the kafka-console-producer.sh script in kafka/bin\n6) Verify that the topology prints those messages\n7) Kill the topology and wait for 30 seconds for it to be completely shut down\n8) Send 5 more messages\n9) Redeploy\n10) Confirm that all 5 new messages are received\n\nHere's the code I used
