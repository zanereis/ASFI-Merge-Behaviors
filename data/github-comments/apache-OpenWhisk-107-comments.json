According to swagger definition:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"result\",\r\n    \"in\": \"query\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Return only the result of a blocking activation. Default is false.\",\r\n    \"required\": false,\r\n    \"type\": \"string\",\r\n    \"enum\": [\r\n        \"true\",\r\n        \"false\"\r\n    ]\r\n},\r\n...\r\n```\r\nEven though I was doing a blocking call, I still had to set it to `false` to get the activation details. \r\nThis brought a little further, but parsing the activation/response resulted into an exception. For this to parse correctly I had to make another modification to the swagger file.\r\n```\r\n\"logs\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"array\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Logs generated by the activation\",\r\n    \"type\": \"string\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHad to become:\r\n```\r\n\"logs\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"array\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Logs generated by the activation\",\r\n    \"items\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"string\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nDoing this in 2 different places made the response parse correctly.\r\nLooking at the response in more details it looks like there is another mismatch in the api specification. The `activation.result` (from the specification) is not present in the response but `activation.response` (unspecified) is. Below is an example response I got during testing:\r\n```\r\n\"response\":{  \r\n   \"result\":{  \r\n      \"id\":\"123\",\r\n      \"Name\":\"name\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"success\":true,\r\n   \"status\":\"success\"\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/346838319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/346838840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2744#issuecomment-346838840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2744","id":346838840,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjgzODg0MA==","user":{"login":"devbv","id":9463930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjM5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9463930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv","html_url":"https://github.com/devbv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devbv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-24T14:21:27Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T14:21:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The travis once succeed just by luck.
