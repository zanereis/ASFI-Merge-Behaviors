Should we ensure this in `AbstractPartitionAssignor.assign` by only adding `numPartitions` to the map if it's not null and `> 0`? This probably works fine at the moment given the current implementation of `Cluster.partitionCountForTopics`, but it seems a bit brittle given that we have no tests for it. Alternatively, instead of coding defensively, we could add a test for `Cluster.partitionCountForTopics` to ensure the behaviour of `partitionCountForTopics` for this case.\n\nWhat do you think @hachikuji @onurkaraman, is either of these options worth it or overkill?
