I would like to propose something here. \r\nI am wondering why do we need to retrofit copying over delta streamer checkpoint into logic meant for hoodie.write.meta.key.prefixes. to me, this new requirement is very simple and not really tied to `hoodie.write.meta.key.prefixes`. \r\n\r\nLet me propose something and see how that looks like.\r\nIntroduce a new config called `hoodie.copy.over.deltastreamer.checkpoints`. we can brainstorm on actual naming later. \r\nWhen set to true,\r\nwithin TransactionUtils::overrideWithLatestCommitMetadata\r\n```\r\n   fetch value of \"deltastreamer.checkpoint.key\" from last committed transaction and copy to cur inflight commit extra metadata.\r\n```\r\nThis is very tight and not error prone.

It reduces the chance of error as well. Here are some thoughts:\r\n\r\n> a new config called `hoodie.copy.over.deltastreamer.checkpoints`\r\n\r\nSince this is very specific to multi-writer/OCC what about putting it under the `concurrency` namespace? Something like `hoodie.write.concurrency.merge.deltastreamer.state`. This also removes the implementation detail of \"checkpoint\" in favor of a generalized \"state\" which will allow us to extend this to other keys in the future if necessary without needing more configs. \r\n\r\n> fetch value of \"deltastreamer.checkpoint.key\" from last committed transaction and copy to cur inflight commit extra metadata.\r\n\r\nYea we can even re-use the existing code (still need my fix) that merges a key from the previous instant's metadata to the inflight (current) one. Now we will just make this access private and only expose a new method which is specific to copying over checkpoint state if the above config is set. Something like:\r\n`TransactionUtils.mergeCheckpointStateFromPreviousCommit(thisInstant, previousCommit)`\r\n \r\nthis will ultimately just call the existing `overrideWithLatestCommitMetadata` (now private) specifically with the metadata key `deltastreamer.checkpoint.key`, successfully abstracting details and removing the need for users to know anything about the internal state of commits.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/946035803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/946148718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3820#issuecomment-946148718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3820","id":946148718,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM44ZRVu","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-18T20:41:58Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T20:41:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yeah, the naming looks fine by me. \r\n\r\nbtw, Can you please attach jira ticket to PR. prefix w/ ticket id.

Or before that, check each commit produced under `--continuous` and see if data size ingested increasing over time. You could exam commit files under `.hoodie/`. Also check the `checkpoint` value in each commit file see if they are advancing over time.\r\n\r\nSome other notes: bulkinsert does not equal to upsert. the former does not update records.
