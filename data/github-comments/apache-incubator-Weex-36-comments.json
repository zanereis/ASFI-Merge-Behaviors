However, the issue seems to still exist in v0.24.0, since I found the following issue in the v24 source as well. In the following analysis, I'll be talking about the v24 (latest stable) source code, downloaded from the website's Releases section.\r\n\r\nThe cause seems to be that env.deviceHeight is not the device height but rather the app container height instead. Weex seems to be doing the following to get the display height: \r\n\r\n``` \r\nResources.getSystem().getDisplayMetrics().heightPixels\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this the height minus the navigation and status bars. \r\nIt might be a good idea to edit this so it works as in iOS. To get the actual device height, you need to call:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWindowManager wm = (WindowManager) thisActivity.getSystemService(Context.WINDOW_SERVICE);\r\nDisplay display = wm.getDefaultDisplay();\r\nPoint size = new Point();\r\ndisplay.getRealSize(size); // API > 17\r\n// do something with size.y\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found it in the following files. Once I have more time I'll try to patch it and see if it breaks anything. I'm quite new to contributing to open source projects.\r\n\r\n> apache/taobao/weex/WXSDKEngine.java:192:    registerCoreEnv(\"screen_height_pixels\",
