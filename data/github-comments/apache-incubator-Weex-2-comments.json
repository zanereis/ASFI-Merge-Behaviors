If you want to use a scale based on your design width, such as 750px, you can use `<meta name=\"weex-viewport\" content=\"750\">`. This would be ok.\r\n\r\nYou can specify your viewport width to 750px with `<meta name=\"weex-viewport\" content=\"750\">`. This meta works for all the `0.11.x` version of weex-vue-render, what is changed is the adapting algorithm. You should set the viewport meta to `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no\">` consistently since the `env.deviceWidth` and `env.deviceHeight` will be calculated relying on this. What you can change is the `weex-viewport` meta.\r\n\r\nBTW, This is not a good place to discuss a issue. If you have more questions and suggestions, here is a offical way to bring up a discussion: https://weex.incubator.apache.org/cn/guide/contributing.html . apache's dev channel mail list is
