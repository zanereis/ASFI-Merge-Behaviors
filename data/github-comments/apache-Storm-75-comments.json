:port 1024}}\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>Even though LocalState is storing a map.  Inside the map are clojure </p>\n{persistent maps, symbols, lists, vectors, and sets}\n<p>  There is also a LocalAssignment (which is a defrecord, that will have a different serialization id if ever modified).  I'm not sure if we want to convert all of this to thrift too?  or if we just want to move LocalAssignment over to be a map.  If we think clojure will not maintain serialized compatability, then we probably want to go to thrift.  If we think that they will maintain compatibility, then we could do something much more simply.</p>\n\n<p>In our experience at least, when we moved from clojure 1.5 to 1.6 we saw the following errors during rolling upgrade testing (reading in local state).</p>\n\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.InvalidClassException: clojure.lang.APersistentVector; local <span class=\"code-keyword\">class </span>incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = -2689426146225009349, local <span class=\"code-keyword\">class </span>serialVersionUID = 4667575149454420891\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>To me this means that clojure is not trying to maintain compatability for serialized objects, like vector.  So I personally would rather move to Thrift for the serialization of local state if possible.  I am going to file a new JIRA just for this work, as it is large enough I think it should be separated from this

You're duplicating the same code everywhere in this patch. Just keep the wait-for-condition function and add a timeout parameter. Then have a 1-arity version that defaults the timeout to 5000ms.

IMO, yes, at most JDK 7.\n\nVarious users use Storm with various JDK versions.\nIt may be unacceptable when I want to upgrade only Storm, but it also requires upgrade of JDK  especially it isn't fully guaranteed to be stable with various libraries, and project itself. \nProject could have many dependencies and Storm is just only one of things.\nPlease note that we can use Storm with JDK 8 without compiling Storm codes to JDK 8.\n\nFurthermore, Oracle still supports JDK7 with Oracle Java SE support (though I don't subscribe), and there still exists OpenJDK 7.\n\nOne more thing, Clojure, Scala, or sth. seems to be still more powerful than JDK 8.\nIf you think that it is better for Storm to move to JDK 8, I encourage you to find spots from current Storm codebase which can take advantage of new JDK version.\nI think it is more important than just changing source / target JDK

Sorry for not providing enough details on jira in first place. </p>\n\n<p>Storm will start supporting rolling upgrades in either version 0.10 or the next version as most of our serialization has moved from java to thrift. Previous version used java serialization which meant the entire cluster had to be running on  same version so it made sense to have a cluster version. With the rolling upgrade this will change and different hosts in the cluster might be running different version. It will be useful for admins to view what hosts are on what versions. </p>\n\n<p>To expose this information this jira proposes to expose the storm version in supervisor summary. This means adding a verion string to this structure <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/storm.thrift#L150\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/storm.thrift#L150</a> and re-generating the thrift structure using <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/genthrift.sh\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/genthrift.sh</a>. Supervisors will also have to store this information in zookeeper so nimbus can read this information so you will need to probably look into modifying <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L505\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L505</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/cluster.clj#L397\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/cluster.clj#L397</a>. Once this data is stored in zookeeper nimbus needs to read it and populate the SupervisorSummary instances with version <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/nimbus.clj#L1250\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/daemon/nimbus.clj#L1250</a>. Finally the ui changes can be made here <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/ui/core.clj#L571\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/clj/backtype/storm/ui/core.clj#L571</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/ui/public/templates/index-page-template.html#L145\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/ui/public/templates/index-page-template.html#L145</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you need any more information and once again thanks for considering to contribute. </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612539315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612540119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4612#issuecomment-2612540119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4612","id":2612540119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1NDAxMTk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-15T04:27:19Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:32:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sriharsha\">sriharsha</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=robinlin\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"robinlin\">robinlin</a> you need to provide a client storm.yaml and also client_jaas.conf<br/>\nfor the user robin under home dir create .storm/storm.yaml with these contents</p>\n\n<p>nimbus.host: \"nimbus\"<br/>\nstorm.thrift.transport: \"backtype.storm.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosSaslTransportPlugin\"<br/>\njava.security.auth.login.config: \"client_jaas.conf\"</p>\n\n<p>and a client_jaas.conf with </p>\n\n<p>StormClient {<br/>\n       com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required<br/>\n       doNotPrompt=true<br/>\n       useTicketCache=true<br/>\n       serviceName=\"nimbus_server\";<br/>\n};</p>\n\n<p>Also please send any questions to users or dev mailing lists instead of opening a JIRA.
