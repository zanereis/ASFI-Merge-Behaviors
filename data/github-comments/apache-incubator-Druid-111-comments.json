So like a partially specified schema. This is useful for a bunch of cases:\n- Specify spatial dimensions but have the rest be automatic\n- Specify some fields as long dimensions but have other fields become string dimensions automatically\n- Specify some dimensions so we can set a particular dimension sort order, but leave the rest out\n\nI think this could all be satisfied with some flag like \"discoverDimensions\" that, if true, would enable dimension discovery even if the user has provided some dimensions and dimension exclusions already. For legacy reasons it should default to \"true\" if dimensions is null/empty and \"false\" otherwise. But if explicitly provided it should be respected.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/255187509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/255189928","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3585#issuecomment-255189928","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3585","id":255189928,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTE4OTkyOA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-20T18:33:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T18:33:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@akashdw

a particular task fails to launch on a mesos agent too many times, spark can decline future offers from that agent, so be aware of that.\n\nThere are a lot of tuning parameters, most notably executor memory and maximum cores, that affect the resources that will be acquired. Also note that spark 2.0 changes how it does resource allocation in Mesos to be much more in line with how the stand-alone cluster functions. I highly recommend getting a migration plan to 2.0 if you haven't started already.\n\nBut please check the mesos master's task history first to see if there are failed tasks for that

I would like to take this ticket, and am wondering the back-off strategy means any exact implementation of a back-off strategy algorithm.\n\nI believe that this proposal is to make the nodes which are frequently disconnected from the cluster have the lower priority for leader election. One possible solution is to provide an executor service to the leader selector which is capable of backing off participating leader election for the given amount of time. \n\nMeanwhile, the leader latch provides a kind of back-off strategy inherently. With the leader latch, a leader is elected by the order of written ZK paths. That is, the node which wrote its name first becomes the leader. Thus, since a node rewrites its name whenever it is restored from disconnection, it will have the lowest priority.\n\nI think that the second approach will work well even though there is only one overlord node in a cluster. What do you think?
