Even though this might only be a cosmetic change for this PR but who knows what other people will build on top of it once it is there. I fear that we won't be able to remove such a flag once introduced.\n\nConcerning whether all `SourceFunction` should have a `stop` method: I think it is not a priori clear that all streaming sources are gracefully stoppable. Take for example the `FlinkKafkaConsumer08`. Currently,   the stop method is implemented by calling `cancel`. However, `cancel` does not guarantee that the sources stop gracefully. Exceptions might be thrown and the state might be inconsistent. In fact, with the current implementation, `stop` won't stop the `FlinkKafkaConsumer08` at all. The `cancel` call only works in combination with the `TaskCanceler` which interrupts the `Task` thread (in this case `LegacyFetcher.run`). If the interrupt does not happen, the `SimpleConsumerThreads` might be stuck for all eternity in the fetch loop.\n\nFurthermore, adding the `stop` method to the `SourceFunction` interface will be an API breaking change and all users would have to implement `stop`, henceforth. I think a `StoppableOperator` interface would be more modular and less restrictive because you have the freedom not to implement a graceful stop operation.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/181350773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/181402377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/750#issuecomment-181402377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/750","id":181402377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTQwMjM3Nw==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-08T14:45:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-08T14:45:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok.

@chiwanpark,\n\n> What is main purpose to support PMML? Is this feature for only model portability in FlinkML?\n\nI've used PMML extensively in a previous project and saw many application cases other than my own. PMML export is necessary for  external portability: you may need to create a model in Flink and use it on local data using a data mining tool for example, or you could deploy it in a production pipeline developed with a totally different technological stack. \nPMML import is optional though: you can use JPMML (the reference implementation of PMML) to read a PMML file and perform the evaluation of the model locally to the node. Import from PMML to the native implementation of FlinkML may be a plus in terms of usability and probably performance but it's not really a blocking issue for a developer.\n\n> If not, we have to support other systems such as R or Spark MLlib.\n\nSupport for R may be interesting by itself but I can't understand what do you mean. MLlib does support PMML export (even if somewhat bugged for a few models like Naive Bayes) so it is already possible to move models from MLlib to Flink.\n\n> What about FlinkML only format? I think that support for distributed system in PMML is poor. XML-based format is hard to parallelize.\n\nThis could be interesting to guarantee the consistency of the models and to tune it to our needs. The complexity of PMML is due to the need of generality and consistency but it's often an overkill to describe simple models. Also it has only partial support for many models that we may want to implement: i.e. any of the online learning algorithms implemented in SAMOA or other online learning frameworks. I know we still miss a few pieces before reaching that point, but still...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/181578375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/181614932","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1604#issuecomment-181614932","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1604","id":181614932,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTYxNDkzMg==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-08T23:14:17Z","updated_at":"2016-02-08T23:14:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Manually merged in d51bec1524a9832a7e6c0f6c5d5be5a42712d365\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/181614932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/181739512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1186#issuecomment-181739512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1186","id":181739512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTczOTUxMg==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-09T07:06:02Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T07:06:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @chobeat, thanks for leaving your comments.\n\nAbout compatibility with other system (such as R or MLlib), I meant that we cannot achieve compatibility with the systems even though we use PMML because there is difference between FlinkML and other systems.

Note that in the previous implementation of the Table API this operation would return 1 because integer average was maintaining a pair of sum and count.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182392029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182393013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/750#issuecomment-182393013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/750","id":182393013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjM5MzAxMw==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T14:18:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T14:18:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tillrohrmann just updated this.

@ggevay, sorry it took me very long to review your PR.\n\nAs I said before, this is a very desirable feature and a solid implementation.\nI think a few things can be improved. Especially the full stop to resize / rebuild / emit records might take some time, depending on the size of the table.\n\nI have the following suggestions / ideas:\n- Split the single record into multiple partitions (i.e., use multiple `RecordArea`s). Each partition holds the data of multiple buckets. This allows to restrict rebuilding, compaction, etc. to only a part of the whole table. In fact this is what I meant in my initial comment about tracking the updates of buckets (which I confused with partitions...). Partitioning is also used in the other hash tables in Flink. It can also help to make your implementation more suitable for the final reduce case, because it allows to spill individual partitions to disk. In `CompactingHashTable` the max number of partitions is set to `32`.\n- Should we think about [linear hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_hashing) for resizing the table. This technique grows the table by splitting individual buckets without the need to reorganize the whole table.\n- Do you think it is possible to extract the ReduceFunction from the table? IMO this would be a cleaner design if we want to use the table instead of the `CompactingHashTable`. In that case, we could also give a more generic name to the table.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIn any case, we need to update the documentation for the added `CombineHint`. I would also be good to extend `ReduceITCase` with a few tests that use `CombineHint.HASH`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182398031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182398308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1609#issuecomment-182398308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1609","id":182398308,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjM5ODMwOA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T14:31:52Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T14:31:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can

I would also be good to extend ReduceITCase with a few tests that use CombineHint.HASH.\n\nOK, I'll do these.\n\n> the full stop to resize / rebuild / emit records might take some time, depending on the size of the table.\n\nEmit is very fast, because `EntryIterator` is reading the record area sequentially. I don't think there is much room for improvement there. (Except perhaps your idea of storing the lengths as negative values, and skipping over abandoned records :))\n\n**Rebuilds because of compactions:**\n\nTypically, the size of the records don't change, in which case no compactions happen.\n\nIf the records change size, that's a mess. But even in this case, performance should be reduced by less than 2x, because the number of insertions done in rebuilds should be proportional to the number of normal update/insert operations, and one insert during rebuild is faster then one usual insert/update, because the linked lists are not traversed (only the bucket segments are accessed randomly; the elements are inserted to the beginning of the lists).\n\n**Rebuilds because of resizing**:\n\nIf the serializer knows the length of the records in advance, then no resizings will happen, because we just calculate the final number of bucket segments at the beginning (see `calcInitialNumBucketSegments`). Unfortunately, currently the serializers almost never know the length, but I hope this situation will improve in the future (for example, see FLINK-3321).\n\nIf the serializer doesn't know the length, then how much time is spent with resizings is greatly affected by the average number of records per key. This is because the time spent with doing resizes is proportional to the number of elements inserted, and if there are lots of elements with matching keys, then most operations will be updates (rather than insertions). I will probably do some performance tests to confirm this, and see how much time is spent in resizes in the worst case (when every key has only one element). (Also, the \"performance should be reduced by less than 2x\" argument from above should be applicable in this case as well.)\n\n> Do you think it is possible to extract the ReduceFunction from the table? \n\nThis should be doable, I'll try.\n\n> Should we think about linear hashing for resizing the table.\n\nThanks, I didn't know about this algorithm. I'll think about this.\n\n> Split the single record into multiple partitions (i.e., use multiple RecordAreas). Each partition holds the data of multiple buckets. This allows to restrict rebuilding, compaction, etc. to only a part of the whole table.\n\nDo you think that this would have a performance benefit? The time of a rebuild is linear with the size, so I don't see how doing it in chunks would improve performance. (I mean, the (frequency of rebuilds of a partition) / (frequency of rebuilds of the full table) is probably the same ratio as the (time to rebuild a partition) / (time to rebuild the full table).)\n\n> It can also help to make your implementation more suitable for the final reduce case\n\nYes, some partitioning will be needed for that. However, I would like to get this in first, and then I'll design the implementation of that case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182477373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/182483003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1517#issuecomment-182483003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1517","id":182483003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjQ4MzAwMw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T17:05:24Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T17:05:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The benefit of having multiple partitions is that you do not need to go over the complete RecordArea but only over a partition.
