Unless I am missing something here, can't the \"storage\" + \"scheduler\" + execute pieces, directly reuse what we have already.\r\n> \r\n> just writing down ideas in my head to see how we are different.\r\n> \r\n> a) Introduce a config `hoodie.skip.table.services` to `HoodieWriteConfig` which will make all writers skip any scheduling + execution of table services, if `true`. Writers throw an error if a lock provider is not configured and `hoodie.skip.table.services=true`\r\n> \r\n> b) TableManagenent server takes as input the uris of the Hudi metastore (so we have a clean dependency. Writers talk to metastore, the table management service picks up tables from metastore) or if we don't want to require the metastore, then we need to register tables as described here already. This can be a CLI command or an idempotent call from a write client. (I am fine either way)\r\n> \r\n> c) Then, for every write/commit on the table, the table management server is notified. Need some poll I think, or since push can be lost (we could do a smarter hybrid?). In response, the table management server will schedule relevant table services, right onto the table's timeline and notify a separate execution component/thread can start executing it.\r\n> \r\n> d) We still need to find a way to do HA here. Unlike the metastore, we need to shard by table here, since we probably want just one server to do the scheduling/execution for every table?\r\n> \r\n> Let me know If that makes sense !\r\n\r\nI think we need to implement the storage and the scheduling part, but the execution part can directly reuse what we already have, such as `HoodieCompactor` and `HoodieClusteringJob`.\r\n\r\na) Totally agree, that's exactly what I think.\r\n\r\nb) When using Metastore, my idea is to sense the table through callback. When the hoodie table commit instant, the TableManagenent hook in the Metastore triggers the scheduling of table services corresponding to the hoodie table. Using this method can avoid Pressure from TableManagenent listing. If we don't want to use the metastore, then we need to support CLI commands or idempotent calls from the write client, as it is possible to change the registration information without restarting the task, such as queue.\r\n\r\nc) Totally agree, we can push only when Metastore is not enabled, and list the corresponding hoodie table when TableManagenent has not received notification for a long time.\r\n\r\nd) I think we need stateless multi-instances to handle requests for all tables, each instance only handles incoming requests, we can use an optimistic mechanism to prevent concurrent scheduling or execution, we can put this in phase2.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120182685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120184102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5527#issuecomment-1120184102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5527","id":1120184102,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5CxKcm","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-07T10:36:05Z","updated_at":"2022-05-07T10:36:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"bc6a9cc5a10206aec10c5c1c72087783b5d3f7aa\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=8487\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"bc6a9cc5a10206aec10c5c1c72087783b5d3f7aa\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* bc6a9cc5a10206aec10c5c1c72087783b5d3f7aa Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=8487) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120184102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120185360","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5457#issuecomment-1120185360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5457","id":1120185360,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5CxKwQ","user":{"login":"Chosen123Wang","id":39905818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTA1ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39905818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang","html_url":"https://github.com/Chosen123Wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chosen123Wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-07T10:45:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-07T10:46:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @Chosen123Wang Could you try this fix to see if it solves your issue: #5471?\r\n\r\nIn my tests, some jobs can succeed and others can't.

With respect to HUDI-3657, as I understand, the problem is for every commit, we have 3 files in requested, inflight and completed states. How about have a mechanism where after a certain threshold in terms of number of commits, we archive or simply delete only the requested and inflight state files and keep the completed state .commit file in the active timeline. Is there any purpose or use case that is being solved by keeping requested or inflight files as well in the active timeline? Ideally once the commit is completed, requested/inflight files should not be needed by our internal logic or by the user.

There's no need to reserve one more 30 minutes. If we want to reserve more, we can increase the configuration parameters. In addition, other cleaning  policies do not retain one more version. I don't understand why they are not consistent.And I think it's a little redundant to retain one more version, because we have reserved enough time through configuration parameters. And it is not consistent with the configuration parameters, which is easy to confuse users.\r\nSo I think it's reasonable not to keep one more version, and the code is more concise.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120365156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120375006","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5406#issuecomment-1120375006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5406","id":1120375006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Cx5De","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T08:34:41Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T08:34:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, you have a valid point here.

I have similar concerns that the management/cost overhead of `.cdc/` might not justify the gain on the read efficiency, for e.g., we've put a lot of efforts in making metadata table stablized and in sync with data table; a reference for what we might have to do to `.cdc/`. Storage-wise, as mentioned above, even if the fraction is small, the actual cost can be significant, due to the table size being huge per se. Even if the storage size is acceptable, for cloud storage users, the added API calls to save new objects incurs more billings regardless of size. In update-heavy tables, this becomes impactful.\r\n\r\nOn option B using `_hoodie_operation`, i agree some benchmarking can be super helpful. It may worth putting more energy there to optimize the logic if needed. UX-wise, it fits nicer to users already running incremental query pipelines; a new config to turn on then they'll get the cdc info.\r\n\r\nIn short, i prefer leveraging on / improving what we already have in hudi. Regardless of design approach, this is a great initiative anyway!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120389506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1120396572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5180#issuecomment-1120396572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5180","id":1120396572,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5Cx-Uc","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T11:00:41Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T11:00:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cajil Have you tried using OverwriteNonDefaultsWithLatestAvroPayload?

@maddy2u Glad to see the interest in write support for hudi tables via Presto. Currently, there is no write support either through the hive connector or the [in-progress native connector](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/17149). However, it is on our [roadmap](https://hudi.apache.org/roadmap/#execution-engine-integration) and we are targeting read support with 0.12.0 release and write support in 1.0.0.\r\n\r\nWe already have a working presto-hudi connector that supports snapshot querying with both COW and MOR tables. It is yet to land in presto. You can help us with more love and comment on that [PR](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/17149).
