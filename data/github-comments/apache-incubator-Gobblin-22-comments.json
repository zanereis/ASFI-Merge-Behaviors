didn't quite understand the problem you described in #861.\n\nMy understanding is that if the user submits either a Runnable or Callable via `ThreadPoolExecutor.submit`, then `UncaughtExceptionHandler` is irrelevant and won't be invoked. Any `Throwable` thrown by the Runnable/Callable will be wrapped into `ExecutionException` in the `Future` returned by `submit`.\n\nIf the user submits a Runnable via `ThreadPoolExecutor.execute`, then any `Throwable` thrown by the Runnable can be retrieved in `afterExecute`. \n\nSo I'm not sure why `ErrorHandlingThreadFactory` is needed. In fact if I understand correctly, `UncaughtExceptionHandler` is only useful if you run a thread manually (not via `ExecutorService` so I'm not even sure whether we need `UncaughtExceptionHandler` in the first place).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/201016557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/201058691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/878#issuecomment-201058691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/878","id":201058691,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTA1ODY5MQ==","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T22:37:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T22:37:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tuGithub
