@BurningCN ,\r\n\r\nWell, this is definitely an interesting thing to discuss. There were some questions from the community about the usage of ordered topics in RocketMQ these days as well. IMO, these kinds of variables, including the topicSysFlag as you pointed out, that are not really utilized in the code of RocketMQ, are mostly used as signs in some cases.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I'd like to build an e-commerce order system and need to create a bunch of topics. Some of the topics would need the ordered messages as the info of an order needs to be under the identical topic. To satisfy such kinds of scenarios, those topics would be marked as “ordered” and supplied with sharding keys. In this case, the \"isOrder\" variable would come into play.\r\n\r\nBut this is just my two cents, I sometimes would also be confused with those kinds of variables that did not have the actual effect in the codebase. You're also welcome to give your opinions as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1186104096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1186189126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4618#issuecomment-1186189126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4618","id":1186189126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Gs89G","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-16T13:47:11Z","updated_at":"2022-07-17T12:07:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

6.29 review意见:\r\n> \r\n> 1. 以SyncStateSet不以IP作为依据，而是以brokerId（Controller给broker的唯一编号）作为依据，HA部分同步要改。\r\n> 2. 整理InSyncReplicas、minInSyncReplicas在Controller模式下含义，当SyncStateSet个数小于minInSyncReplicas时，副本写入将不再成功，返回PutMessageStatus.IN_SYNC_REPLICAS_NOT_ENOUGH\r\n> 3. 不再复用NameServer的心跳，都使用Controller独立的心跳、去掉controllerDeployedStandAlone参数，心跳包新增maxOffset、confirmOffset、last epoch等字段。这些会作为选举的依据\r\n> 4. 选举后SyncStateSet应该继承下来而不是直接变为新Master，一个场景是新被选出的主，该主马上又挂了，此时就没有master可以被选举（不过从当前实现来看，若改为继承，slave若没有马上连到master，会增加故障恢复的时间，并且master会马上更新新的SyncStateSet，而slave连上master首先需要获取haMasterAddress从namesrv注册结果中返回，需要一段时间（考虑在controller中维护haMasterAddress）），同时这种情况下注意confirmOffset回退问题（先进行分析）\r\n> 5. Controller 的格式带上rocketmq message header，以便于后面扩展\r\n> 6. 对于磁盘坏、心跳好的情况，需要再细分PutMessageStatus（能显示磁盘坏），如果磁盘坏了，同样需要选举切换。\r\n\r\n已完成第2、3点修复。第1点修复@hzh0425进行中","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1187616255/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1188551170","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4631#issuecomment-1188551170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4631","id":1188551170,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85G19oC","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T03:22:42Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T03:23:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

If the topics subscribed to by different instances are not the same, the subscription relationship saved by the server will be frequently modified, which will lead to confusion in consumption and even message loss. The correct method should be to use different consumer groups to subscribe to different topics.

> 想咨询一下 设计的想法，为什么 MQClientInstance 中的consumerTable 的key是group， 而不是 topic+group. 这样就能区分 不同的topic + 相同的group了，对应的是两个不同的consumer。\r\n> \r\n> @gongchangyou 事实上，一个消费组的所有实例应该订阅相同的Topic，如果不同实例订阅的Topic不相同，服务端保存的订阅关系会被频繁修改，会导致消费混乱，甚至消息丢失。正确的方法应该是使用不同的消费组去订阅不同的Topic。可以参考下[https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/43523.html。](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/43523.html%E3%80%82)\r\n> \r\n> In fact, all instances of a consumer group should subscribe to the same topic. If the topics subscribed to by different instances are not the same, the subscription relationship saved by the server will be frequently modified, which will lead to confusion in consumption and even message loss. The correct method should be to use different consumer groups to subscribe to different topics. You can refer to https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/43523.html.\r\n\r\n感谢您的回复，我已经拜读了 订阅关系一致 原则。其实我的问题很简单。就是如果 规定 topic +group 相同 才算是**真正的**同一组。这样设计是否简单些？这样的话 不同的topic ,相同groupname 的consumer就会被认为是不同组的consumer。自然就不会消费混乱了。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1192380088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1192383416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4656#issuecomment-1192383416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4656","id":1192383416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85HElO4","user":{"login":"gongchangyou","id":2409053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDkwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2409053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou","html_url":"https://github.com/gongchangyou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongchangyou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:39:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T09:39:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"我大概可以猜到
