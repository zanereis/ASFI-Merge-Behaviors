The order of the map elements keeps the same and pass for the regular runs, but the order can't be guaranteed when running `NonDex` tests because `ConcurrentHashMap`. If using `ConcurrentHashMap` is the best in this situation as you mentioned the exception, it would be better to change the test code in that doesn't require orders, otherwise the tests will be keep flaky when running.
