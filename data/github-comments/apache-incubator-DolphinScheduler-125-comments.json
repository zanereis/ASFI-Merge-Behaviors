Sorry that I didn't go the normal channels like mail-list for wanting a quick answer.\r\n\r\nNow by following your exchange of emails I found this issue.\r\n\r\n1, May I suggest to change the \"Label\" from \"apple silicon\" into \"arch-arm64\", and if you prefer to also create \"arch-arm32\", this is in line with other popular projects of how best to name/label the arch/ISA. Besides, \"apple silicon\" is hardly the typical chip people think of when ARM64 is mentioned. This will make people searching issues easier.\r\n\r\n2, Docker Hub does officially support multiple arch as shown here for example: https://hub.docker.com/_/zookeeper, with these listed immediately under the title **IBM Z, x86-64, ARM 64, ARM, 386, PowerPC 64 LE**.\r\n\r\n3, Was there a specific reason to use docker images from bitnami rather than Docker official as mentioned above? Or https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres. Both postgres and zookeeper official images already support ARM64.\r\n\r\nWould be great to have official ARM64 images soon,\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nDong","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/866338517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/866475773","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5675#issuecomment-866475773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5675","id":866475773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjQ3NTc3Mw==","user":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T02:36:54Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T02:36:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@k9flame Yes, some attribute is store in database as JSON string, this is due to the fact that we are not currently using a document-based database.

It has richer features, such as standard and unified management and configuration. Therefore, the corresponding images are used in docker compose and swarm. This way reduces maintenance costs. We have considered replacing them with the [official library](https://hub.docker.com/), but the current feedback that the demand for using arm64 is not so strong, and its replacement cost under K8s is relatively high. So in K8s we will keep the Bitnami images until they released the arm64 architecture next. As for docker compose and swarm, before the Bitnami images don't support the arm64 architecture, it is possible to switch to the official library. Anyway, arm64 architecture support will meet soon","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/866497432/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/866498578","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5685#issuecomment-866498578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/5685","id":866498578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NjQ5ODU3OA==","user":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-23T03:43:35Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T03:43:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wangmingzhiJohn It is because of the tenant?

this issue comprehensively, I think maybe we can add the following one?\r\n1. build spark docker images, and when submitting applications let user choose or fill the docker name and version parameters. And other parameters as well?\r\n\r\nPs,  maybe we should consider more about your 3rd and 4th point. In yarn side, we get yarn application id from logs and filter pattern like \"application_xxxxxxxxxx_yyyy\", and get application state through yarn-rest-api. As to kubernetes, we don't have application pattern like yarn, maybe we should add some pattern to pods or something?\r\n\r\nPs, as we discussed through email, maybe this issue is not that hurry?

 Sorry for the trouble bring to you, my modification is based on 2 known issues:\r\n1. When we open the user information page, the enable/disable status of current user would always shows empty   \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/123501923-ecac4880-d67a-11eb-9457-f003b13178f2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n   ----so I add this:\r\n\r\n   ```javascript\r\n   this.state = this.item.state\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n2. If the user has not configured a tenant yet, if he just want to  modify  his personal information, It would always occurs an error, the main reason is shown as the note:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/123501972-4c0a5880-d67b-11eb-946e-9b89ef359c35.png)\r\n\r\n   ```javascript\r\n   // If the user has not configured a tenant yet, this.item.tenantId would be 0, the if check returns false\r\n   // so I try to add a new check like this: if (this.item.tenantId || this.item.tenantId === 0) \r\n   if (this.item.tenantId) {\r\n   \tthis.tenantId = this.item.tenantId\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nIt's my fault that I did not explain clearly the reason for my modification in pr #5627\r\nwhen I submit the pr, I've verified all the scenarios I know. I'm not sure what's the new bug you said ? If a bug is introduced, I am very sorry, hoping for your reply. 😛
