Reasoning for this is that `RDFa11Extractor extends BaseRDFExtractor` which inherits the [parser function inputstream parameter](https://github.com/apache/any23/blob/63ba2fc82966cc056a2e475af849154d0dfdcf93/core/src/main/java/org/apache/any23/extractor/rdf/BaseRDFExtractor.java#L105). This input stream is not the 'fixed' steam but the raw document. \nThe only way I can think around this is for us to \n- refactor the [RDFa1.1Extractor](https://github.com/apache/any23/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/any23/extractor/rdfa/RDFa11Extractor.java) such that it extends [TagSoupDomExtractor](https://github.com/apache/any23/blob/63ba2fc82966cc056a2e475af849154d0dfdcf93/api/src/main/java/org/apache/any23/extractor/Extractor.java#L60) as oppose to (eventually) the [ContentExtractor](https://github.com/apache/any23/blob/63ba2fc82966cc056a2e475af849154d0dfdcf93/api/src/main/java/org/apache/any23/extractor/Extractor.java#L44), or\n- undertake a mass refactoring which essentially removes the [ContentExtractor](https://github.com/apache/any23/blob/63ba2fc82966cc056a2e475af849154d0dfdcf93/api/src/main/java/org/apache/any23/extractor/Extractor.java#L44) altogether... this would provide us with a much more flexible and adaptable extraction framework IMHO.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/201537723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/201545776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/17#issuecomment-201545776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/17","id":201545776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTU0NTc3Ng==","user":{"login":"ansell","id":82365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell","html_url":"https://github.com/ansell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-25T22:15:44Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T22:15:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The system does seem a little too complex for our purposes and isn't usable because of that.\n\nRemoving generics would be the first step IMO as there are too many rawtypes definitions which indicate generics are being used badly.\n\nContentExtractor may be able to be completely removed instead of being refitted into the process after that and the parser should always be set to parse as far as practical for our purposes.\n\nIt is a little strange that there isn't a buffered, markable, InputStream provided for all of the steps to reuse as necessary rather than pushing a raw InputStream or other source into different extractors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/201545776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/201550510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/17#issuecomment-201550510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/17","id":201550510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMTU1MDUxMA==","user":{"login":"lewismc","id":1165719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1165719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc","html_url":"https://github.com/lewismc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewismc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-25T22:24:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T22:24:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree.
