@wohali \r\n\r\nBy no means am I a regular maintainer of CouchDB, but it sounds like this particular issue would be resolved best by adding some documentation explaining to users how they would \"disable\" a user using one of the methods described above. \r\n\r\nThe only thing then that would be needed would be the returning of a special error code, but that could be done perhaps on the client side? If done on the `derived_key` the client could manually inspect the derived key for the disable character, e.g. `!`, and manually show an error with the correct message to the user. \r\n\r\nIf this works I can open a PR to make the update in the documentation.

So I took a look at the pull request referenced there and my thoughts are two fold:\r\n\r\n1. If this change is accepted we (I can take the lead on this) make a change in Fauxton to something similar @janl recommended in the thread, w.r.t. a modal that allows one to login again without losing their progress, or similar. \r\n\r\n2. We would need to document that enabling this will result in a decrease in performance as replicator session refresh would fallback to the periodic \"hard\" refresh. \r\n\r\nAs for an implementation, tentatively I'm thinking (this is pretty naive, though):\r\n\r\n\r\n(in `couchdb/src/chttpd/src/chttpd.erl`)\r\n```erlang\r\n\r\nbasic_headers(Req, Headers0) ->\r\n    Headers = Headers0\r\n        ++

We had switched to make `allow_peristent_cookies = true` to be the default not too long ago https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1619 which also includes the logic to forcibly refresh the session in the replicator.\r\n\r\nOne thing to worry about as @wohali have mentioned is about clients which rely only on auto-refresh. They'd have to implement a logic similar to what the replicator uses. I mentioned it in the ML linked but I'll paste it below as well for completeness:\r\n\r\n> To review, currently a cookie refresh in the replicator happens in these\r\ncases:\r\n> 1) Auth / Authorization requests fail. Then we try to get a new session\r\ncookie from _session. With auto-refresh this is not that used I imagine. It\r\ndoes involve making an extra request (make original request, fail, refresh\r\ncookie, retry request). And also this doesn't work if endpoints allow\r\nanonymous writes.\r\n> 2) max-age in the cookie value is about to expire (over 90% expired). We\r\nalso enabled allow_persistent_cookie=true by default, as you mentioned, so\r\nmost recent endpoints  should send max-age now. Without auto-refresh this\r\nwould hopefully become the best method to do refresh.\r\n> 3) If max-age cannot be parsed we still get a new cookie at close to\r\ndefault expiry interval for CouchDB (550 seconds) This accounts for\r\nendpoints which haven't upgraded to the latest release, but just happened\r\nto have session expiry defaults (600 seconds).\r\n> 4) Response headers return a new session cookie. In that case we'd\r\nremember the cookie as the new session cookie. But if we decide not to do\r\nthat anymore. In that case the other 3 conditions would hopefully be enough\r\nto perform the refresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting thing to think about is if this behavior could somehow be signaled by the server. In the welcome message (as a feature), or a cookie attribute `...; Autorefresh=False; ...`? So clients in the future would know to force refresh before expiration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/511050337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/511068362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2072#issuecomment-511068362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2072","id":511068362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTA2ODM2Mg==","user":{"login":"tabeth","id":5572859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzI4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5572859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth","html_url":"https://github.com/tabeth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tabeth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-13T00:07:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T00:07:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I did see that comment.

We assume it will be the default but we don't really know.\r\n\r\nThe case of anonymous writes highlighted in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1619#issue-217349651 is something worth considering. That's the case where the server doesn't send a `Set-Cookie` header and the clients keep using the expired value. If anonymous writes are allowed, authentication doesn't fail (no 401 error) and a VDU function is used to control access based on authenticated username.\r\n\r\nSo overall, it seems like it could work. The \"false\" cookie feels like a hack (though it might work). Maybe we instead we always force `allow_persistent_cookie=true` if the new feature is enabled as well and let clients use `max-age` field for refreshes. I had suggest a custom cookie attribute that explicitly signals to clients that cookies won't auto-refresh, but have no idea how common or supported the idea of custom cookie attributes are...  But otherwise it seems like the new option might work and it would be useful in many contexts (and we also update Fauxton to handle auth failures and refreshes better).\r\n\r\nWe might need more eyes on this issue (@rnewson, @janl) in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/511222282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/511280646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1884#issuecomment-511280646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1884","id":511280646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTI4MDY0Ng==","user":{"login":"chintan-mishra","id":24296709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mjk2NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24296709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra","html_url":"https://github.com/chintan-mishra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chintan-mishra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T05:48:01Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T05:48:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@wohali that mention was in regard to Deno for JS engine.

Would you mind pointing to documentation (issues, design documents, whatever) or elaborating why this is expected behaviour in a clustered database? I'm asking, because I don't have much experience with clustered databases and would like to understand the underlying problem better. The other reason why I'm asking is: you say that it will be addressed in upcoming releases. Does that mean that is perhaps not as expected? It sounds like there are cases where this behaviour is unexpected and those should be addressed? Which are they?\r\n\r\nThanks again if you'd be so kind to explain.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/513020114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/513042518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1741#issuecomment-513042518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1741","id":513042518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzA0MjUxOA==","user":{"login":"Coinbird","id":4898799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTg3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4898799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird","html_url":"https://github.com/Coinbird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Coinbird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T00:24:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T17:42:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I had this issue as well. CouchDB 2.3.1\r\n\r\nStrangely, I was unable to log out as well, when it happens. In Fauxton, I noticed that there was a database that was \"unable to load\" even though I was logged into Fauxton.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, it had something to do with per_user databases getting in a weird state; I'm not entirely sure how I got there.  I was messing with permissions on the _users DB and that perhaps I caused it (I was creating users from another _users account.)  Either a user hadn't been properly deleted (somehow) or some kind of conflict between userdb- and the corresponding username.\r\n\r\nMy fix was from Fauxton,  find the userdb-xyz database that \"cannot be loaded\" and manually issue a DELETE from curl, Postman, (or tool of your choice.) I used Basic auth for this DELETE command, using my administrator user/pw.\r\nOnce that \"Cannot be loaded\" DB was gone, everything started working again. Luckily this was a local dev DB and I didn't need the contents of the userdb.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Also realized I had some dead nodes from playing with clustering before--this is perhaps why I was seeing the \"cannot load DB\".  http://localhost:5984/_membership showed 3 nodes even though I was intending to run just 1. I followed this to axe the extra ones. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS- it can potentially delete data if you axe the wrong cluster, it appears. https://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/cluster/nodes.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/513042518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/513043872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1579#issuecomment-513043872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1579","id":513043872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzA0Mzg3Mg==","user":{"login":"akircher","id":5734777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzQ3Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5734777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher","html_url":"https://github.com/akircher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akircher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T00:31:07Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T00:33:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @wohali.
