However, IMO, what we need is a simple proxy server. For Vite, the ideal choice should be [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy). But in your code, you've included the initialization of a Vite project, and some of the resources there won’t actually be used—like the CSS files.\r\n\r\nThis kind of separated development environment increases debugging costs, so it’s more suitable for early, non-optimized DEV. Later on, I’d recommend replacing Brunch with Vite.
