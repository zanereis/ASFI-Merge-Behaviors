With this change, it worked fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/332644621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/332646768","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2640#issuecomment-332646768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2640","id":332646768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjY0Njc2OA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-27T20:34:02Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T20:34:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What was sending a Airflow version string?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/332646768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/332647176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2639#issuecomment-332647176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2639","id":332647176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjY0NzE3Ng==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-27T20:35:35Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T20:35:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/332647176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/332655041","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2553#issuecomment-332655041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2553","id":332655041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjY1NTA0MQ==","user":{"login":"moe-nadal-ck","id":28959205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTU5MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28959205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck","html_url":"https://github.com/moe-nadal-ck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moe-nadal-ck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-27T21:04:44Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T21:04:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are we ready to merge this PR ?
