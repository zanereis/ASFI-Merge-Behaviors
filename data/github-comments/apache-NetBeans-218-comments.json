BUT they are not considered for compilation. For annotation processing the generated source is a compilation _output_, not an _input_. My understanding is, that you need to separate two different `generated-source` types:\r\n\r\n- `generated-sources` from general maven plugins, like the jakarta webservices integration. These generate sources and the sources are then consumed by the compiler together with the sources from `src/main/java`\r\n- `generated-sources` from annotation processing. These are not consumed by the `compiler`, but are generated by the compiler. They are present, so that you can look at them or bundle them in a src jar, not for the compilers benefit.\r\n\r\nThe latter it might make sense, when you consider, that annotation processor can not only generate source code for the compilation, but can also directly influence the generated bytecode (bytecode weaving). One such example is lombok. lombok can generate getters, setters, equals, hashCode, toString and probably more methods on the fly, based on annotations. To do this it hooks into the compilation process and directly injects the code into the class file, it does not write source code. An approach that reads the generated sources would not be helpful here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2282769038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2282770272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7645#issuecomment-2282770272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7645","id":2282770272,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6IEE9g","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-11T13:58:55Z","updated_at":"2024-08-11T13:58:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hebrerillo this is a cup-half-empty-full situation.

I can try to implement various solutions, but the core problem remains the same: \r\n- _\"identify whether an ErrorProvider has been written before or after\"_ of #7579 (that's what this PR does)\r\n- or make an incompatible change and fix as many [misbehaving cases as reported](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7647#issuecomment-2276098200) (I can do that as well)\r\n\r\n> you want to be able to expose the enso functionality quickly, ...  CompletionProvider and implement a Hint provider in Enso module itself (or in a bridge-module).\r\n\r\nThat's a misunderstanding. If I wanted to expose Enso functionality in NetBeans, I would do what you suggest. But I am (a NetBeans) architect. I don't want people (not me!) to write the same code twice. I want them to provide a single SPI implementation that works in both NetBeans IDE and VSCode. As #7579 demonstrated the `ErrorProvider` is the (sufficient enough) SPI to achieve that. All we need to do is to find out whether the _delegation should be used or not_.\r\n\r\n> I can imagine a GUI tool, that is run headful, but wants to provide an LSP. It is totally intransparent\r\n\r\nPeople can usually imagine a lot of weird usecases (I used to be good at that when I was the architect). However for our purposes, we have just three:\r\n- NetBeans IDE\r\n- Apache NetBeans VSCode extension\r\n- some NetBeans based application\r\n\r\nThe `isGraphicalEnvironment` is a good check for all these cases. The **check is already used at various places**, but I can certainly replace it with something different. An _explicit system property_ or a _check for a module present only in VSCode extension_ come to my mind.

It turned out, that the reason I pulled my veto (that only the Java ErrorProvider has the problem of crosstalk) was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe GsfErrorProvider from my POV demonstrates, that you can implement a targetted bridge, that only affects a subset of mimetypes and thus is safe.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting is to implement the inversion of the GsfErrorProvider, that you can opt in as a module author to use, for example by registering some common bridge implementation.\r\n\r\nThe bridge does not need to be in NetBeans from the beginning as you can implement it in enso without a problem.\r\n\r\nI see nothing solved by forcing this into NetBeans now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2282887125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2282887344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7650#issuecomment-2282887344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7650","id":2282887344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6IEhiw","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-11T20:57:04Z","updated_at":"2024-08-11T20:57:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Lets keep the discussion in #7659.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2282887344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2283012665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7437#issuecomment-2283012665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7437","id":2283012665,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6IFAI5","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-12T02:20:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T05:44:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Well, NetBeans uses javac for parsing, and the same `Unexpected tree` error is shown in a notification.

So, solving this at the mime-type seems much more reasonable than creating a new `isEnabled`, which everyone will need to implement, and whose implementation will be very tricky.\r\n\r\nIn other words - there should be an opt-in, based on mime-types. When one creates a support for new language, say L (e.g. mime-type `text/x-l`), they can create `ErrorProvider`, `CallHierarchyProvider`, etc., and register them for their mime-type. And then say, for `text/x-l`, use the providers that are globally installed. (There may need to be some shenanigans around things like `CommandProvider`, as those are global.)\r\n\r\nThis could either be hardcoded in every implementation class in `lsp.client` (which is mostly what the current changes are doing), or it could simply be a bridge, so this would look like an ordinary LSP server for most of `lsp.client`. I would be for the bridge, to separate concerns. The amount of information we can pass from the provider to the UI is limited by the LSP anyway, so I don't think I see a strong need to complicate every feature implementation in the LSP client with the need to support two usecases when it can support only one (the LSP server one), and there can be a bridge gluing things together. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I hope Enso and others wanting to reuse their implementation could do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RegisterLSPServicesForMimeType(\"application/x-enso\")\r\npackage org.enso.tools.enso4igv;\r\n```\r\n\r\nor:\r\n```\r\n@RegisterLSPServicesForMimeType(\"text/x-l\")\r\npackage org.enso.tools.enso4igv;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand all could be handled for them, without the need to do magic stuff in `isEnabled`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2283734734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2284247217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7659#issuecomment-2284247217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7659","id":2284247217,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6IJtix","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-12T15:12:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T15:12:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I can also just fix the GsfLanguage cases and wait for another report, if that's your preferred choice.\r\n\r\n@jtulach I am sure you know but this is a good time to point out that NetBeans does not have a QA team right now. Variants of this patch were reverted twice before if I remember correctly.

They have the tendency to be onesided and fall out of love. We have a single user (enso), so the question is: How common will Java based LSP be in practice and if they exist how often will they be implemented using NB code and not just LSP4J directly? For the latter case a different kind of LSPBinding implementation might make sense, keeping the implementations separate, but communication in the same process.\r\n- Implementing this in `lsp.client` seem arbitrary - the common base is not that big between the two use cases (integration with LSP servers and NB based partitial LSP implentations)\r\n- Running the diagnostic routines on any change, might overload the IDE. It was an explicit implementation detail, that there are two levels of diagnostic (error and hint) and these two are run with a 500ms for the LSP server, if I'm not mistaken. \r\n- Registration of the `ErrorBridge` is done outside the EDT (call to `putClientProperty`), this might or might not be a problem, but the function is specified to generate `PropertyChangeEvent`s and listeners might expect to be only called from the EDT.\r\n- The hack/workaround in `LspCompletionProviderImpl` (check if \"real\" completion provider is present) is not necessary if the provider would be explicity registered\r\n- The changes to the HintsDiagnosticsProvider and the JavaErrorProvider are not needed anymore\r\n- The implementation could be done first outside the core, settle down and be integrated later. The impact for the target module would be minimal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2287017861/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2287026603","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7659#issuecomment-2287026603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7659","id":2287026603,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6IUUGr","user":{"login":"mbien","id":114367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien","html_url":"https://github.com/mbien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-13T20:00:18Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T20:00:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"i too am +1 for revert for NB23, reasons given at https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7659#issuecomment-2284247217\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2287026603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2287076255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/7662#issuecomment-2287076255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/7662","id":2287076255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6IUgOf","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-13T20:27:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T20:27:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mbien retargeted this to delivery (and updated documentation).

I'm concerned about introducing anything that might auto-execute the build tool without warning, particularly but not exclusively if the projects aren't trusted. \r\n\r\nNote: currently one could execute ACTION_PRIME with the same effect... and Maven does not implement trust concept, at the moment. This API contains a flag to mark the project trusted ( processed by the implementation), so if Maven impl some day implements trust checks, it will be able to fail the request with a documented status.\r\nBTW - with the API, trust concept can be added 'centrally' in front of passing the request to the impl (which can still do its own checks).\r\n\r\n> I can understand the need to reload with POM modification, but that shouldn't happen auto-magically. \r\n\r\nThe fact is, that POM reload **already happens** mostly automagically, for all opened projects. Maven module itself schedules a reload on the background as well as Gradle. But an observer/client lacks a handle to wait for that schedule to complete. This API does does not do that on itself though - it needs \"someone\" who requests a refresh.\r\n\r\n> With that comment, I particularly meant making sure we don't get into a situation like with the need to add a warning in the Micronaut wizard that was downloading and executing any old `mvnw` without knowledge!\r\n\r\nMaven / Gradle display at least cancellable progress indicator. The implementation is free to prompt the user (i.e. Maven impl might be changed to prompt before launching the priming build, since at that time, it already **knowns** some artifacts are missing). BTW - neither gradle or maven does do that atm when doing \"priming\" or \"full_online\" load. If one requests NbGradle.Quality.FULL_ONLINE on a trusted project, it will happily download all the world.\r\n\r\n> That depends on who the \"we\" is that needs this feature! 😉 Most of us are putting our spare time into this.\r\n\r\nYeah, I realized that while you were replying and ashamed deleted the comment. sorry. \r\n\r\n\r\n@neilcsmith-net  ... as I am replying, I am getting a feeling that the API does not actually make things more \"automagic\", but the discussion abot it itself surfaces some areas that **are automagic already** for years.

I share concerns about dependencies aswell though. But this might work:\r\n\r\n- Place the annotation `RegisterLSPServices` (we might want to bikeshed about the name) into `api.lsp`. That module is in the dependency tree anyway as you need it for `ErrorProvider` and the other LSP services.\r\n- The annotation process could then write an `*.instance` file into the MimeLookup for the annotated class, making it available to other modules\r\n- lsp.client could now read the entries from the MimeLookup and create the bridges\r\n\r\nSo users of the module, that provides the `ErrorProvider`, don't get additional dependencies. Users that want to use the bridges load `lsp.client` and get them. This would leave the question whether or not the functionality should be in `lsp.client` or be split of into a separate module `lsp.support`.

IMHO, overall it is better that  clients DO NOT run \"priming build\"  (which can fail, but the failure cannot be detected reliably btw)  explicitly e.g. when classpath is incomplete, but instruct the project system to \"make the project resolved\" (somehow). The less the client knows what it means \"resolve project\" the better.\r\n\r\nThe Reload API implementation in this PR now does just what would be done if the code was maven module's friend and used the existing friend APIs.

This seems to mess with the signal chaining and prevents the shutdown hook from running again.\r\n\r\nThis may or may not be a graalvm bug - needs more investigation\r\n\r\n(there are other options how to implement this, e.g the daemon could cancel builds once the client connection is gone - it all depends on the
