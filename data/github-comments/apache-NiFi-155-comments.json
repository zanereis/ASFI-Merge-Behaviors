But I think this PR is problematic.\r\nThe Jira spells this out as adding a default backpressure at the Process Group level. I don't think this is necessary, but I don't necessarily have a problem with it. However, the PR doesn't appear to update VersionedProcessGroup, which means that after it's been pushed to the registry and then pulled out again, the newly created one will not function like the old one did - it won't have the default settings. That needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nHowever, more concerning is the introduction of the default FlowFile Expiration. We should not be introducing FlowFile Expiration without the user explicitly setting it.

Including flows that already existed and newly created/pushed flows.\r\n- Can go to localhost:18080/nifi-registry-api/swagger/ui.html and am still able to see all of the appropriate documentation, including the full documentation for VersionedProcessGroup/VersionedProcessor, etc. that I got to from the \"flows\" section of the API.\r\n\r\nI agree with @exceptionfactory that it makes sense to only include the swagger-annotations dependency where the nifi-registry-data-model module is used but otherwise, all looks good to me. I'm a +1 as soon as that gets updated.\r\n\r\nThanks for pulling all this together @tpalfy - I think this is a definitely a good move in the right direction. And thanks to @exceptionfactory  for the thorough review & @kevdoran for helping with the review & providing insights!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/868562295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/868563195","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5145#issuecomment-868563195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5145","id":868563195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODU2MzE5NQ==","user":{"login":"kevdoran","id":5102332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDIzMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5102332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran","html_url":"https://github.com/kevdoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevdoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-25T15:02:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T15:02:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yep, agree with @exceptionfactory and @markap14 regarding that dependency scope, and aside from that this looks good to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/868563195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/868700074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5187#issuecomment-868700074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5187","id":868700074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODcwMDA3NA==","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-25T16:54:17Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T16:54:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for addressing this issue @thenatog, and thanks for verifying @gresockj!

I was planning to write the tests for the formats I had added. Should I create new test for each format or create the tests in the PutBigQueryBatchTest.java. I don't see any tests for CSV format. I only see it for JSON format. Please advise.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/875815456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/875816755","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/5192#issuecomment-875816755","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5192","id":875816755,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NTgxNjc1NQ==","user":{"login":"markobean","id":16822728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16822728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean","html_url":"https://github.com/markobean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markobean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T18:06:10Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T18:06:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Java 11 contrib-check succeeded, so I pushed update.
