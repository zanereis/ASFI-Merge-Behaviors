If yes, is it possible to provide examples? It also could be worth updating the documentation to reflect that option. I know it's always painful for users to leverage the CLI when both keystore and truststore are required (even if you can use the proxied entity feature).\r\n\r\nThanks for asking @pvillard31.\r\n\r\nThis improvement provides the foundation for alternative authentication using the NiFi CLI, but additional work is required in the CLI itself to enable an alternative to mTLS.\r\n\r\nI agree that mTLS can be challenging to configure for automated integration, so this pull request provides a foundation for future improvements. With this change, it will be possible to enhance the CLI to support OAuth 2 Client Credentials or Device Flow authentication. That will require additional consideration, as obtaining an Access Token often involves multiple steps. However, with these changes in place, there will be more options for integration.\r\n\r\nI pushed a commit updating the OpenID Connect section of the Admin Guide highlighting support for the Client Credentials Grant Type and outlining the basics of the implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2007302062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2007389592","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8532#issuecomment-2007389592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8532","id":2007389592,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM53plWY","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-19T14:51:04Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T14:51:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @exceptionfactory that makes sense!

Can you share some details on how this can be leveraged as-is? Trying to understand how this can be tested and how this improvement would be used with NiFi deployments.\r\n\r\nSure, good question.\r\n\r\nThe exact details vary between Identity Providers, but the basic process for exercising this new capability is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Configure an Application Client on the Identity Provider, enabled for the Client Credentials Grant Type\r\n2. Get the Client ID and Client Secret values associated with the Application Client from the Identity Provider\r\n3. Make an HTTP request to the Identity Provider requesting an Access Token using the Client ID and Client Secret values\r\n4. Make an HTTP request to the NiFi REST API using the `access_token` value returned and passing it to NiFi using the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme\r\n\r\nThe first two steps are specific to the Identity Provider configured.\r\n\r\nStep 3 is from the OAuth 2 specification for Client Credentials as described in [RFC 6749 Section 4.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.4.2).\r\n\r\nStep 4 uses existing NiFi REST API handling with the HTTP `Authorization` header.\r\n\r\nHere are some concrete examples for several Identity Providers on how to configure a Client Credentials Grant Flow:\r\n\r\n- [Okta Client Credentials Flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#client-credentials-flow)\r\n- [AWS Cognito Token Endpoint for Client Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-endpoint.html#post-token-positive-exchanging-client-credentials-for-an-access-token)\r\n\r\nStep 3 could be part of future enhancements to the NiFi CLI. For example, with an OpenID Connect Discovery URL, a Client ID, and a Client Secret, the NiFi CLI could make a request for an Access Token and then make a request to the NiFi REST API with the customized Authorization header.\r\n\r\nAs a way to test this using NiFi itself, the [StandardOauth2AccessTokenProvider](https://nifi.apache.org/documentation/nifi-2.0.0-M2/components/org.apache.nifi/nifi-oauth2-provider-nar/2.0.0-M2/org.apache.nifi.oauth2.StandardOauth2AccessTokenProvider/index.html) could be configured with the `Client Credentials` Grant Type, and InvokeHTTP could be used to invoke NiFi REST API methods.\r\n\r\nThis would be worth a blog post at some point, but hopefully this provides sufficient background.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2007489198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2007507642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8532#issuecomment-2007507642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8532","id":2007507642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM53qCK6","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-19T15:34:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T15:34:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As mentioned in the updated documentation, testing this capability also requires the following changes:\r\n\r\n1.

here is my conclusion on this. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have the cycles to do the full re-write that this code probably requires. The main and 1.x support branches currently do not work to process stateless flows that have sub-versioned flows. It's **broken** in current state. My two small changes fix both the main and 1.x support branches in terms of processing the flows (tested and confirmed); however, there are 9 integration tests that appear to be _trying_ to test this exact use case. Clearly, these these 9 tests were bad to begin with because they don't catch the bug at all. I'm not sure what actually changed in the code base such that these 9 tests fail in the main branch but not the 1.x support branch. I see many places where this concept of a \"registryId\" is not fully programmed out, so making a require non-null on it does not work. \r\nI'm proposing an acceptance of these merge requests with the broken tests commented out to fix processing in production, with a continued ticket to investigate coding this out completely and fixing the integration tests at a later time. Otherwise, the product remains broken indefinitely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2017834831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2017966457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8533#issuecomment-2017966457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8533","id":2017966457,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM54R7l5","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-25T13:04:42Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T13:04:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm closing this pull request for now so that we can focus on making the correct changes on the main branches.

haven't encountered issues regarding symbolic links in the (arguably limited) manual testing I've done. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do not quite understand what you're addressing. \r\nThe PR does not change the way `getListing` addresses the SFTP server. `stat` is only used when inquiring for a single resource using `getRemoteFileInfo`. \r\n\r\nThe only change in `getListing` is how the results are mapped. However, even that's not really the case. Where before `newFileInfo` would receive a `RemoteResourceInfo` and access `.getAttributes()`, `.getName()`, and `.isDirectory()` it now receives the first two as arguments directly.

If you run a versioned stateless flow that has sub-versioned progress group, there is a NullPointerException thrown on the build method of StandardVersionControlInformation where there is a non-null requirement on \"registryId\". \r\n\r\nCode has changed in main versus support/1.x, but the bug exists on both. What I've found is the JerseyClient calls that are made to map the response from the registry-api back to the higher level VersionedProcessGroup -> VersionedFlowCoordinates both return JSON where the VersionedFlowCoordinates > registryId is always null. Now in the main branch, stateless uses some of these new \"synchronizer\" classes, so the best place to insert a solution is to add an else on the null check where the code runs the \"determineRegistryId\" method and set the value to \"1\" for versioned flows that do not have a registryId associated to them. Doing this passes all of the integration tests and code checks and fixes the bug. Since this class does not exist in the 1.x support branch, my best solution is to just comment out the null check (this breaks integration tests in main, but not in 1.x). \r\n\r\nI continued to look further at this idea of a \"registryId\" within the registry api code. The GET method on buckets/flow/version returns the same class that the stateless code uses to map into on the JerseyClient call. I then looked at the api code to POST new versioned flows, and it also expect the json as a parameter to match the same class. Well, since there is no \"non-null\" requirement on the registryId, versioned flows are stored in the database (or whichever storage adapter used) with this property as null. I did not check to see if the latest NiFi Registry UI is now setting this property, but making it non-null would break any older version of registry and not be backwards compatible.

If you run a versioned stateless flow that has sub-versioned progress group, there is a NullPointerException thrown on the build method of StandardVersionControlInformation where there is a non-null requirement on \"registryId\". \r\n\r\nCode has changed in main versus support/1.x, but the bug exists on both. What I've found is the JerseyClient calls that are made to map the response from the registry-api back to the higher level VersionedProcessGroup -> VersionedFlowCoordinates both return JSON where the VersionedFlowCoordinates > registryId is always null. Now in the main branch, stateless uses some of these new \"synchronizer\" classes, so the best place to insert a solution is to add an else on the null check where the code runs the \"determineRegistryId\" method and set the value to \"1\" for versioned flows that do not have a registryId associated to them. Doing this passes all of the integration tests and code checks and fixes the bug. Since this class does not exist in the 1.x support branch, my best solution is to just comment out the null check (this breaks integration tests in main, but not in 1.x). \r\n\r\nI continued to look further at this idea of a \"registryId\" within the registry api code. The GET method on buckets/flow/version returns the same class that the stateless code uses to map into on the JerseyClient call. I then looked at the api code to POST new versioned flows, and it also expect the json as a parameter to match the same class. Well, since there is no \"non-null\" requirement on the registryId, versioned flows are stored in the database (or whichever storage adapter used) with this property as null. I did not check to see if the latest NiFi Registry UI is now setting this property, but making it non-null would break any older version of registry and not be backwards compatible. Therefore, the only solution at this point to fix stateless NiFi in its current state is to just set registryId to \"1\" if it is null. I believe this code is still probably prototype being worked and evolving, so this will be a temporary fix until those mandates are in place on a concept of \"registryId\".

Otherwise, when it loops down to pull the sub-versioned process flow, it'll append the /{bucketId}/{flowId} parameters twice and make a bad call to the registry-api. The best way I came up to fix that was just to make sure to start with the base registry url and append the storage location parameters to always construct a valid registryUrl. I noticed the 1.x support branch was originally setting the registryUrl to coordinates.getRegistryUrl(), which was changed to coordinates.getStorageLocation() in main. This fix works for the 1.x branch as well.\r\n\r\nDo you have another value other than \"1\" you'd prefer me to set it to? FYI - it has to be a static value in order for all of the current tests to work.\r\n\r\nI can work on adding some unit tests for both of these fixes. I'll add a comment here when I commit them and are ready for review.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2023618547/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2023848676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8574#issuecomment-2023848676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8574","id":2023848676,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM54oXrk","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-27T19:54:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T19:54:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2023848676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2024255135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8417#issuecomment-2024255135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8417","id":2024255135,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM54p66f","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-28T01:49:28Z","updated_at":"2024-03-28T01:49:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

try and cause something to output I added a line into one of the  OTEL tests to just create a ByteBuf and leave it alone.  And indeed the tests started failing.  I then released the ByteBuf and indeed the tests again works.  However, they didn't make it clear which test had the issue and it isn't the one listed in the above output.  So as a general alerting perhaps that is helpful but in finding the core issue it didn't seem particularly helpful. \r\n\r\nNotably a full clean build with all the checks still works. The full system tests still work.  So to a certain sense this might give some added confidence about handling ByteBuf in the case of Netty well.  But we have a lot of cases of resource leak concerns and this only covers one.   For the most part our code reviews should consider such things. \r\n\r\nThat said - I'm not confident pulling in this dependency and adding to these tests like this is currently warranted.  Our otel stuff for instance doesn't appear to make the byte buffers itself but rather the underlying library seems to.  If so that is the thing which should have such checks.  I might be wrong on that but worth noting.\r\n\r\nI'm a -0 on this change as it stands.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2027769891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2027863339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8585#issuecomment-2027863339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8585","id":2027863339,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM543r0r","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-30T01:35:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-30T01:35:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the updates @sullis, and thanks for evaluating the functionality @joewitt.\r\n\r\nAlthough detecting resource leaks is an important part of developing with Netty, I agree with @joewitt that the failure messages are too generic to be useful under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith general efforts to reduce the dependency footprint of Apache NiFi over the last year, any new dependency needs to be evaluated carefully.

I created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12999 to track the issue.\r\n\r\n> To the substance of the issue, however, can you clarify how this is a problem for a local build as opposed to GitHub Actions build?\r\n\r\nThat is a great question, and I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there is some global caching going on with those deps in GitHub Actions or some configuration that causes them to fail silently in that environment, but I'm not sure. I would have to investigate further.\r\n\r\n>  It also works on recent local builds, so is the issue limited to running Registry unit tests? If it is possible to rescope the changes, as opposed to just reverting that would be ideal, but I understand it may be more complicated.\r\n\r\nThe issue happens to me whenever I try to build the project with maven (used `./mvnw clean install` initially and `mvn clean install` at the root level to see that error. I also cannot cd into nifi-registry's ui and manually install npm deps either. If others aren't running into this issue on `main`, I'll gladly close this and chalk it up to a local issue I need to investigate. I found this issue late last night and wanted to have a PR ready to discuss in the morning due to the potential impact a failing build on `main` would have.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In regard to rescoping the changes, we could do that but registry has many outdated deps, specifically Angular 11, that would require much bigger changes than a simple update with npm.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2037093709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2037604719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8572#issuecomment-2037604719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8572","id":2037604719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM55c2Fv","user":{"login":"slambrose","id":35692305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjkyMzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35692305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose","html_url":"https://github.com/slambrose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slambrose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-04T15:59:35Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T15:59:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR has been closed until the 2.0 fix is completed and merged (PR 8536)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2037604719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2037620687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/8544#issuecomment-2037620687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/8544","id":2037620687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM55c5_P","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-04T16:06:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T16:06:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In order for the append to work I had to set `Writing Strategy` to `Simple write`, if I leave the default `Write and rename`, it actually deletes the file.

Node 18, so it is unclear how this works in automated builds. It also works on recent local builds, so is the issue limited to running Registry unit tests? If it is possible to rescope the changes, as opposed to just reverting that would be ideal, but I understand it may be more complicated.\r\n\r\n@sardell Is it possible to update the version of node that this requires? Possibly in the pom.xml? Or maybe even update the registry's package.json such that we don't fail because of it? I know we don't want to support npm versions less than the minimum but I think newer versions of npm are fine right?\r\n\r\nI am also a bit confused. I tried to run `./mvnw clean install` from /nifi/nifi-registry and that command seems not to be supported. When I run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` everything builds fine locally for me.\r\n\r\n➜  main git:(NIFI-12956) ✗ pwd\r\n/Users/jaslan/Development/nifi/nifi-registry/nifi-registry-core/nifi-registry-web-ui/src/main\r\n➜  main git:(NIFI-12956) ✗ node -v\r\nv16.13.2\r\n➜  main git:(NIFI-12956) ✗ npm -v\r\n8.1.2\r\n➜  main git:(NIFI-12956) ✗ npm ci\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'karma-webpack@5.0.1',\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '>= 18' },\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v16.13.2', npm: '8.1.2' }\r\nnpm WARN EBADENGINE }\r\nnpm WARN deprecated @npmcli/move-file@1.1.2: This functionality has been moved to @npmcli/fs\r\nnpm WARN deprecated stable@0.1.8: Modern JS already guarantees Array#sort() is a stable sort, so this library is deprecated.

In order for the append to work I had to set `Writing Strategy` to `Simple write`, if I leave the default `Write and rename`, it actually deletes the file. Is this intended? If not we should add another dependent property so if AVRO is chosen, the Writing Strategy must be Simple Write.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, during the whole dev testing I left the 'Writing Strategy' property on default value which is 'Write and rename', and it worked completely fine for me. I double checked it now and it still does. As I see it, my ticket does not affect the connection between writing strategy and conflict resolution strategy so it should work just as before.\r\n\r\nI also checked 'Writing strategy'='Simple write', and that also works for me without any problems. \r\n\r\nIf you experience file deletion I assume your flow might need a tweak. I do not know the processors you use exactly, but I had file deletion problems when I left the 'GetHDFS' or the 'GetFile' processors 'Keep source file' on default which is 'false'. In order to make my flow reexecutable I changed that value to 'true'.\r\n\r\nFor testing I used the following flow:\r\n1. GetFile('Keep source file'='true') -> PutHDFS(append,AVRO,'Write and rename'), but it also works with 'Simple write'\r\n2. GetHDFS('Keep source file'='true') -> ConvertAvroToJSON (I just used this step to validate the content of the avro file, not sure if the convert processor exists upstream, I used a custom nifi instance for this)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2039019933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/2039271408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/7544#issuecomment-2039271408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/7544","id":2039271408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAanjsM55jM_w","user":{"login":"ravinarayansingh","id":8307151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDcxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8307151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh","html_url":"https://github.com/ravinarayansingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravinarayansingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-05T09:00:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T09:00:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\n> @ravinarayansingh Thanks for your work and patience on this pull request.\r\n> \r\n> Unfortunately I may not have been clear in previous comments regarding the interface-based approached for the `ColumnNameNormalizer`.

It would be helpful to add a basic unit test class for `InMemoryFlowRegistry`, just to track that expected behavior.\r\n> \r\n> The other consideration is the base Registry URL. Although the current `getBaseRegistryUrl()` method works when a Registry server is accessible directly, if there is a reverse proxy in front that has an additional context path, rebuilding the URL with just the host and port presents a problem. For example:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> https://nifi-registry.local/context-path/nifi-registry-api\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The method would return the following:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> https://nifi-registry.local\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> The Registry Client would then attempt to append `/nifi-registry-api` as the context path from the root, which would result in failures.\r\n> \r\n> In light of the fact that the `storageLocation` includes the full path, it seems like a regular expression match would address all scenarios. Something along the lines of the following pattern:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> ^(https?://.+?/nifi-registry-api).*$\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> With that pattern, the first capturing group can then be used at the registry URL.\r\n\r\nAdditional Unit tests will be address in future work for InMemoryFlowRegistry class.
