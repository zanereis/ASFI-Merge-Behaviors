configure the setting of the `opentelemetry-collector` to print metric data in the console, The form of the data is similar to the following:\r\n``` \r\nMetric #16\r\nDescriptor:\r\n     -> Name: mysql.threads\r\n     -> Description: The state of MySQL threads.\r\n     -> Unit: 1\r\n     -> DataType: Sum\r\n     -> IsMonotonic: false\r\n     -> AggregationTemporality: AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY_CUMULATIVE\r\nNumberDataPoints #0\r\nData point attributes:\r\n     -> kind: STRING(cached)\r\nStartTimestamp: 2022-07-28 01:09:58.7576015 +0000 UTC\r\nTimestamp: 2022-07-28 02:57:07.0609427 +0000 UTC\r\nValue: 0\r\n```\r\nThe format provided to me by `MAL doc` is as follows:\r\n```\r\ninstance_trace_count{region=\"us-west\",az=\"az-1\"} 100 \r\n```\r\nMaybe the data format will change by the `SkyWalking OpenCensus Receiver`.\r\nBut I am confused about when I configure the `metricsRules` by MAL what will the names of these Metrics(such as the `instance_trace_count` of above) I need to call?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1197610951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1197626387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9376#issuecomment-1197626387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9376","id":1197626387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85HYlQT","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-28T03:55:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T03:55:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`instance_trace_count`

If BanyanDB pod fails (network partition, worker node down), do we have to restart and wait for it to recover, or have other failovers like activating a slave backup?\r\n\r\nBanyanDB will know nodes' roles. The operator doesn't take care of recovery. Restarting the pod is acceptable. \r\n\r\n\r\n> 2. If users changes BanyanDB version and its docker image, can we rolling update BanyanDB while still providing normal service? Does BanyanDB support hot-update for its start-up configurations?\r\n\r\nThe rolling update is a complicated topic. We don't have any discussions in the community. The operator could leave it as is now and refine the CRD once it's on our radar. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1199155661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1199598681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9411#issuecomment-1199598681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9411","id":1199598681,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85HgGxZ","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T15:53:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T15:53:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"No, there is no such thing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1199598681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1199600852","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9411#issuecomment-1199600852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9411","id":1199600852,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85HgHTU","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T15:54:29Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T15:54:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oracle is commercial prod, it is out of open source hands.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1199600852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1200164492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/9376#issuecomment-1200164492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/9376","id":1200164492,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85HiQ6M","user":{"login":"yswdqz","id":74546965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTQ2OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74546965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz","html_url":"https://github.com/yswdqz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yswdqz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-30T14:10:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-30T14:11:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm running into a problem.

We would list service on the dashboard as the first page in menu. How does this list come from if you only use MAL?\n2. Metrics have to bind with an entity, service, instance,or endpoint. Then you have to generate one of these according to you metrics labels.\n\nThat is why you need to provide label(s) for service function to generate an entity.\n\nDocs actually are helping a little but not much for visualization.
