@wypoon, thanks for the PR. I don't see a strong reason to expose the threshold to users. Instead, it's better to hide it from users. Here are reasons:\r\n1. It is an internal threshold that user doesn't have to understand, and probably don't want to understand.\r\n2. We can potentially remove it in the future if possible. We use to discuss that here https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3535#issuecomment-996355892, it is not valid at that time though.\r\n3.

Following this line of thought, we should probably also address the question of whether the SQL text should be validated in Iceberg/the API implementation, or validation is left to the enclosing engine. If it is validated in Iceberg/the API implementation, then Iceberg/implementation needs to understand the dialects as well. If it is left to the enclosing engine, there is the risk of passing an invalid view text. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, whether it is responsibility of Iceberg (or the API implementation) to ensure the semantic equivalence of all the representations (and not only the schemas) when the intention is to add more dialects of the same logic.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we assume there is a translation tool, we may consider if it makes sense to store one representation (dialect) and let the remaining representations (dialects) be handled by translation, as opposed to letting the caller generate all the representations, which as you indicated, could fall out of sync.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I believe adding new representations (e.g., dialects) of semantically equivalent views (case 2 above) should not increment the view version. Do you agree? It seems this might result in having to distinguish between view representations that only add a dialect and preserve the semantics and view representations that change the semantics.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question about Coral schema validation, Coral infers the schema of a view given the view text and base table schemas (see some [test cases](https://github.com/linkedin/coral/blob/ceb8fdfc8c91eb58a0864ca92c22361361f73c3c/coral-schema/src/test/java/com/linkedin/coral/schema/avro/ViewToAvroSchemaConverterTests.java#L24)). It uses Avro schemas for representing the schemas (due to its rich semantics), but extension to use Iceberg schemas is straightforward.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1253381372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1253409649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4925#issuecomment-1253409649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4925","id":1253409649,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KtYNx","user":{"login":"wmoustafa","id":10084105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDg0MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10084105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa","html_url":"https://github.com/wmoustafa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wmoustafa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T08:58:46Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T08:58:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Should the spec define rules for schema evolution of views across different versions?

I don't see a strong reason to expose the threshold to users. Instead, it's better to hide it from users. Here are reasons:\r\n> \r\n> 1. It is an internal threshold that user doesn't have to understand, and probably don't want to understand.\r\n> 2. We can potentially remove it in the future if possible. We use to discuss that here [Core: Replace Set with Bitmap to make delete filtering simpler and faster #3535 (comment)](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3535#issuecomment-996355892), it is not valid at that time though.\r\n> 3. We can adjust the value according to internal implementation. For example, we can increase the threshold when we use more efficient data structure to store pos delete rows.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think?\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion on whether to expose this threshold to the user. We do expose various optimizations to the user, with sensible defaults, so users who are not interested or have no need to tune them do not need to. So even though this particular setting may not be of interest to most users, I don't see much harm in it. My main interest, though, is in allowing a way to set this threshold easily for testing the code path I mention. If you have a good suggestion for another way to set the threshold, I'm happy to consider it.\r\n\r\nA hacky way would be to allow the threshold to be set in `DeleteFilter` by a system property, and to set and unset the property in the test.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254083288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254141300","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3217#issuecomment-1254141300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3217","id":1254141300,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KwK10","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-21T19:34:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T19:34:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think most of the above-mentioned [are in](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/python/pyiceberg/expressions/base.py) or are being worked on ([expression visitors](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5303)).

I just (today) created my own project https://github.com/trust-in-rust/rustberg with a modest goal of support a small subset of iceberg operations through the datafusion project. The iceberg-rs library that you linked was the first one that I saw, but it only supports metadata files for now, like you discovered. I also found https://github.com/joshuarobinson/rust_iceberg which actually reads more than metadata and supports a query through datafusion. However, it doesn't support the partition/schema evolution based split planning that one would have to do when using iceberg and evolving tables.\r\n\r\n@openinx just like @snth We also have a very small scale data lake based on iceberg on-premises. We use iceberg to make it easier to migrate the lake to a cloud later. We use Hive Metastore to store the latest metadata files and use NFS for table storage. We use spark (single node is sufficient for our needs) to ingest data and provide a python library for end users to query the data. The query needs are modest and the targeted query is mostly handled by the partitioning scheme and the resultant data that needs to be further queried can easily fit in one node. Currently we use pyspark in the user library and the startup time of JVM/spark and in general the slowness introduced by pyspark is something that we'd like to reduce. Hence looking at rust for a iceberg-lite kind of query API based on datafusion","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254395202/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254487516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4709#issuecomment-1254487516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4709","id":1254487516,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KxfXc","user":{"login":"liuml07","id":159186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07","html_url":"https://github.com/liuml07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T03:52:16Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T03:52:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I have rebased this to avoid conflicts.

@purefunctions, it's cool to hear that you are also working on a rust iceberg implementation. In the meantime I extended the iceberg-rs repo with a catalog trait, a [postgres catalog](https://github.com/JanKaul/iceberg-catalog-postgres), reading of manifest and manifest_list files. And I'm currently also working on a reader for datafusion. You can find the source at my fork of iceberg-rs: https://github.com/JanKaul/iceberg-rs. I created a couple of PRs for https://github.com/oliverdaff/iceberg-rs but I haven't received any response.\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplicate efforts I would like for all of us to focus on one repo. I don't mind which one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254683003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254690858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/4996#issuecomment-1254690858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/4996","id":1254690858,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KyRAq","user":{"login":"chenwyi2","id":19389434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzg5NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19389434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2","html_url":"https://github.com/chenwyi2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T08:23:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T08:23:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"we use cdc mode, the data is always changing, even if we use strategy to auto-retry,  rewritedatafile will always be failed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254690858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254705276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5826#issuecomment-1254705276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5826","id":1254705276,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85KyUh8","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T08:36:10Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T08:36:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"According to https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/4855 the AWS integration tests are intentionally not part of `check` and require aws credentials and such","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254705276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1254759825","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5404#issuecomment-1254759825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5404","id":1254759825,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85Kyh2R","user":{"login":"chenwyi2","id":19389434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzg5NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19389434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2","html_url":"https://github.com/chenwyi2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenwyi2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T09:22:28Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T09:22:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Is this problem solved?

@JanKaul I like the idea of pooling resources and focussing on one implementation.

This, however, is not a deal breaker.\r\n\r\nI'd like to understand where our goals align so that the combined effort is beneficial for more than one person!

If it is validated in Iceberg/the API implementation, then Iceberg/implementation needs to understand the dialects as well. If it is left to the enclosing engine, there is the risk of passing an invalid view text.\r\n\r\nI would vote for leaving to the enclosing engine or translation tool to validate the correctness and semantic equivalence in the initial API implementation.\r\n\r\nImagine in the most manual way, there is a data engineer manually adding 2 representations for Spark and Trino, and the engineer does the manual translation, and the translation might not be perfect but works for their use case. Then the engineer invokes this API to update the Iceberg view spec. We should make sure at least this use case can proceed without issue without Iceberg throwing unnecessary validation exceptions.\r\n\r\nWe can always introduce features like `CoralValidatedSqlRepresentation` for people who would like to use certain tool, and plugin points in the Iceberg library, such that the integrations could live as plugin packages that don't even need to live in the Iceberg repository.\r\n\r\n> I think we'll probably need to better define what createView exactly entails. There are 2 cases I can think of that should be handled in createView.\r\n\r\nBased on the logic above, I would vote for (1), which is to create a brand new view, and have another API for `updateViewRepresentations`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1255328952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1255356834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/5832#issuecomment-1255356834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5832","id":1255356834,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85K0zmi","user":{"login":"karuppayya","id":5082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODI3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya","html_url":"https://github.com/karuppayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-22T17:47:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T17:47:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java#L655\r\nIs
