Doesn't this method already handle this? If the `URI`s are the same then it will just do a `renamePath` (so if its HDFS -> HDFS or local -> local then it just invokes a rename operation which is what we want); and this rename operation can be at a folder. We basically want to avoid renamining each file individually when the data is moving from HDFS -> HDFS or local -> local.\n\nIf the file systems are different then it uses `FileUtil.copy` which just walks the tree and uploads each file individually. This is fine, the only optimization we may want to make is to walk the tree ourselves and spawn a new thread for each file upload. I don't think it is possible to atomically bulk upload a bunch of files to HDFS, you would have to bulk upload them to a staging folder and then perform a rename operation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/171769229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/171774457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/572#issuecomment-171774457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/572","id":171774457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTc3NDQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-14T20:46:00Z","updated_at":"2016-01-14T20:46:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You are correct that `movePath` correctly handles doing a rename when moving between the same filesystem and a copy/delete when moving between different filesystems.  Also, like you mentioned above, this PR already walks \"the tree ourselves and spawn a new thread for each file upload\".  It does this by calling `movePath` for each file within the tree.  When the call succeeds it updates the WorkUnitState to complete.  @zliu41 concern is that this will reduce performance for moves within the same filesystem.  My suggestion above was that the publisher detect that the publish is between the same filesystem and that the filesystem is HDFS (not sure what the FileSystem implementation for this is), then optimize the publish by calling `movePath` on each root folder (not walking the directory tree) and when successful update all WorkUnitStates for that path to complete.\n\nDoes this make sense?

After looking at this more today, I wonder if this may be more complex then needed. It seems like gobblin has a couple of different ways to handle publishing the data. \n\nThe first is having the job perform the publish. This is similar to the reduce stage in a Map-Reduce program as all tasks must complete and write to staging before any files can be published. This enables jobs (with a couple restrictions) to be created that do not publish any files unless all tasks have completed successfully. The first restriction is that the staging filesystem must support atomic folder renames (HDFS) so that the entire folder will (or will not) be moved from staging to publish. An additional restriction is that when gobblin is run under yarn, the filesystem _must_ be shared with all tasks (HDFS). I believe the current BaseDataPublisher functions correctly with these assumptions. This is the default mode for gobblin. Trying to operate in this mode with the staging folder in S3 causes the problems that were the impetus for this PR.\n\nThe second method of publishing is to allow the tasks to publish the files. The original code for this is similar to the generic publish code in this PR (publishing the files indicated in state, rather than the whole folder). This method can result in a subset of the files for the job being successfully published. Therefore it is impossible to perform an all or nothing publish. Additionally, it is not possible to have the publish overwrite the existing data.  That said, this method should be significantly faster as the publish can be distributed and start sooner.  The staging filesystem _does not_ need to be shared among tasks. The filesystem _does not_ need to support atomic folder renames.  This mode is must be explicitly configured for each job.\n\nDoes this seem right?\n\nAm I correct in assuming that job level publish was the original system and that task level publish was added afterwards?\n\nThinking about the use cases for both of these methods leads me to:\n1. Job level publish with folder replace is a great fit for loading dimension tables.  If dimension tables were only partially replaced, queries which join against these tables would be \"missing\" data (due to being dropped out of the join).\n2. Task level commit seems to be a great fit for fact tables. Partial data commit will be fixed on subsequent runs. Since data is always being appended there is no risk that while querying the joins will cause \"missing\" data.  There is a risk for under reported numbers, but that should be fixed with subsequent runs of gobblin.\n\nDoes this match how you use this within LinkedIn?\n\nIf everything I wrote above hold true, I'm not sure that this PR is providing much benefit. \n\nI agree that the BaseDataPublisher is doing too much. It would be nice to split up the task and job publish codebases.\n\nLastly, I see the biggest problem to using gobblin right now as the lack of clear scenarios and the corresponding job files.  gobblin has so many options that figuring out how to accomplish a given task without guidance can be quite difficult.\n\n@sahilTakiar, let me know what you think.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/173786303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/174022692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/605#issuecomment-174022692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/605","id":174022692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDAyMjY5Mg==","user":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T19:40:07Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T19:40:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/174022692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/174034622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/626#issuecomment-174034622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/626","id":174034622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDAzNDYyMg==","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-22T20:15:27Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T20:15:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pcadabam can you review?

When you want to publish data from multiple Tasks at the same time (usually to the same folder), you want to use the Job-Level Publisher.\n\nAnother relevant piece of information, is that Gobblin has a concept of `WorkUnit`s and `Extract`s. An `Extract` is a logical grouping of `WorkUnits` - such as a table in a database, or a partition in Kafka. The goal of the `BaseDataPublisher` was to publish all data from an `Extract` at the same time, atomically. By default, `WorkUnit`s from the same `Extract` end up in the same writer output folder.\n\nI see a few options at this point:\n- I still think this PR provides a concrete benefit, because rename operations (atomic or not) can fail, and we shouldn't be marking `WorkUnitState`s as `COMMITTED` until we know for sure the publish was successful.\n- If this PR is getting too hectic, it may just be better to implement a new `DataPublisher` that solves the S3 problems.\n- A lot of the problems seem to arise from the `ParallelRunner` - we could have a simple version of the `BaseDataPublisher` which does not use the `ParallelRunner`.\n\nAs for your last comment, yes there are way too many config options in Gobblin. We have discussed this problem quite a few times within our team and are still working on ways of simplifying the flow. We also want to work on general ease of use for Gobblin. Any suggestions or additional comments you have on this are definitely welcome. I also encourage you to fill out the following Google Form with any suggestions you have: http://goo.gl/forms/LtRRxlxIfp - we are trying to collect more feedback from our users to see what problems they are facing the most.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/174734390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/174742820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/626#issuecomment-174742820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/626","id":174742820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDc0MjgyMA==","user":{"login":"pcadabam-zz","id":1166372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/pcadabam-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcadabam-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-26T00:21:02Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T00:21:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM

I'm wondering how this will work correctly with S3 given that job based publishing move/renames a folder at a time and that is not an atomic action.  #572 handles this differently by switching to renaming/moving the individual files within the folder. \n\n#569 allows for exactly-once publishing, but it too won't work correctly with S3.  For instance, while running a FsRenameCommitStep it could fail to copy the entire folder.  The root of the folder will exist and when it is retried it will be skipped because `this.dstFs.exists(this.dstPath)` return `true`.\n\nAs I said in my last comment on #572, I still want to get this in. It is a high priority for us (as well as you), but making sure this works with a wide range of possible filesystems is also important. We made good progress today on getting gobblin running in our stage environment and so I should be able to get back to #572 soon.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/179031330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/comments/179189246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/661#issuecomment-179189246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/661","id":179189246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTE4OTI0Ng==","user":{"login":"chavdar","id":928795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODc5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar","html_url":"https://github.com/chavdar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chavdar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T12:07:30Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T12:07:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree that catching ExecutionException should be moved in the loop.
