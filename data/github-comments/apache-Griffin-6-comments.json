Thank you for the review, it is really strange to add getData to HttpUtil.\r\nAlso, I checked the code in HttpUtil and found the following problems:\r\n1. The `HttpUtil.postData()` and `HttpUtil.httpRequest()` has no usages.\r\n2. There is a bug in `HttpUtil.doHttpRequest()`. When method = 'PUT', after `case PUT_REGEX() =>`, the GET request is executed instead of PUT.\r\n3. The third parameter `params: Map[String, Object]` in `HttpUtil.doHttpRequest()` are not used and do not take effect.\r\n4. `HttpUtil.doHttpRequest()` only supports POST and \"PUT\" request. (GET and DELETE are not supported.)\r\n\r\nSo my new commit is as follows:\r\n1. Remove `HttpUtil.postData()` and `HttpUtil.httpRequest()`, which has no usages.\r\n2. Reimplement` HttpUtil.doHttpRequest()`, enable use of third parameter `params: Map[String, Object]`, and support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods, and return status code and response string.\r\n3. ElasticSearchSink.scala, which calls HttpUtil.doHttpRequest(), has also been modified accordingly.\r\n\r\nSince the method is an external Http request, UT is not easy to implement. I tested it in our environment and it worked very well.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/738654894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/comments/739647875","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/griffin/pull/587#issuecomment-739647875","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/587","id":739647875,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTY0Nzg3NQ==","user":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-07T03:57:52Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T03:57:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@XiaoyuBD
