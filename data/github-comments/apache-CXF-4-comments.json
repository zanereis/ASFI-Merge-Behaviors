method logInputStream of the LoggingInInterceptor class passes text/plain content type to the writePayload method if the payload content was truncated. It should avoid issues that happen in the writePayload method of the class AbstractLoggingInterceptor when the payload stream contains truncated data (and therefore invalid xml) and content type is set to text/xml. In that case the PrettyXmlStreamWriter fails to output the payload stream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/316543724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/316624288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/294#issuecomment-316624288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/294","id":316624288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjYyNDI4OA==","user":{"login":"sberyozkin","id":467639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/467639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin","html_url":"https://github.com/sberyozkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T07:44:57Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T07:44:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, can you please rewrite the test code with the Java 7 in mind - CXF 3.1.x should compile with Java 7","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/316624288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/316763791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/294#issuecomment-316763791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/294","id":316763791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjc2Mzc5MQ==","user":{"login":"alex-korobko","id":11591901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkxOTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11591901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-korobko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-korobko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-20T16:48:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T16:48:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Rewrote the test code to comply Java 7 spec.

We'd be able to use this property in the non-OSGI case too (to find the correct jar if needed). In OSGI case, as I suggested earlier, we just check if the name contains '/' then it is Maven otherwise it is a bundle name only. See many people know the Maven artifacts but finding the bundle name requires more work so if people use Maven artifacts it is just simpler for then to use the artifacts, 'swagger-ui' is not a very uniique value to be honest...Anyway, we'd still be able to use a single OSGI Resolver and be able to skip the Maven related code in the short term if the user sets a swaggerUiName property without '/'\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/331410019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/comments/331410470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cxf/pull/315#issuecomment-331410470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/315","id":331410470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTQxMDQ3MA==","user":{"login":"sberyozkin","id":467639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/467639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin","html_url":"https://github.com/sberyozkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sberyozkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-22T10:23:34Z","updated_at":"2017-09-22T10:23:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would you be OK I applied your name-based resolution code per the above comment for you to see how it will look like ?
