tested the utility with the new changes but I am still reviewing the code. Here are my observations so far:\r\n\r\n1. I ran it with 1.12 and 1.13 and there were still a few differences between the checked in 112_113 yaml file and the output of this utility (few missing entries for knn etc.). The same for 111 to 112. I have a feeling that this is not because of a bug in the utility but maybe because a few things were manually added to the changelist files for the previous releases. Can you please verify ?\r\n1. I noticed that there were a few indentation changes. I am assuming that this will not affect upgrade testing.\r\n1. We will run this utility before tagging the new release. So for ex if the previous release was 1.15 and the new release is 1.16, then the utility will be run when the version is 1.16-dev on the master branch. In this case, how should the utility be run? Should it be run against the master branch for the latest release? This is important because the branch name is used for the description message `Changelist for MADlib version old_branch/tag to new_branch/tag`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/420830677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/420841822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/madlib/pull/319#issuecomment-420841822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/319","id":420841822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDg0MTgyMg==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-13T00:25:33Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T00:25:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Do you mean audit all the table creation and try to combine all the data into one big table and every sql just use the same table? For example, for pagerank and hits in `graph` module,  we only create one vertex and one edge table with all the special cases/data, and always use those two tables for all the sql files? Besides, how do we deal with some special test case when we only need 1 row/ few row in the table instead of a bigger table? Also in some DEV check we assert a specific sql returns a specific number of rows, and those assertion will fail because of the change of input table.\r\n\r\nThe other concern is that this solution requires lots of audition and changes in every sql file. Developers need to understand how to add new row in the single table creation file and how sql files under the same module work together with each other. For example, if someone wants to add a test case in HITS under graph, instead of adding a new case in hits sql file, he needs to go to another file and add table, and go back to hits sql file and add test case.

With the schema-qualification, we can drop the table just like we're doing now (so no conflicts between test files). \r\n\r\n**Also note:** `madpack` is supposed to drop the file-specific schema after executing each file (see function [_execute_per_module_install_dev_check_algo](https://github.com/apache/madlib/blob/03e82bc50494367c6b65dced66cf0042b3060042/src/madpack/madpack.py#L768)). Hence, common table names in independent tests within same module are not supposed to conflict with each other (if you've seen this happen then it requires investigation). \r\n\r\nFinally, a guideline MADlib followed a few years ago was to not issue drop table statements in IC since all created tables are in a unique schema and will be dropped at end of test execution (I plead guilty of ignoring this guideline). This requires the names of data and output tables within a file to be unique - hopefully, we give such tables meaningful names so that we can identify the cause of a failure from the name. \r\n\r\n**In summary**: I suggest we don't circumvent the original issue, rather fix it by giving meaningful names and avoiding `drop table` statements in IC/DC.

The naming convention is somewhat strange. Under the modules folder, we have a bunch of folders (graph, etc.) but they are not actually modules, the individual sql files are. The madpack code uses the variable `module` for the folder name which further muddles the naming. This means `madlib_installcheck_graph` schema will be created and dropped for each module in graph. We might want to change it to reflect the actual module name. \r\n\r\nI think the reused name issue might be more widespread than we think. I am pretty sure `abalone` and `houses` datasets are used in multiple modules.\r\n\r\nI think removing the `DROP TABLE` statements might work as @iyerr3 suggested.

alternative is to integrate the madlib deployment into the IC/DC. What I mean is similar to how PostGIS runs its unit tests. IC/DC creates a temporary database/schema, deploys the MADlib over there, runs the tests as usual and then removes the temporary database/schema. This will inevitably increase the running time of IC/DC but I believe it will be more stable. Since we assume that the user might be using the madlib deployment schema, it is also possible that they drop and/or recreate UDTs, UDFs and UDAs. Our IC/DC does not account for a case like that and will probably fail. \r\n\r\nIt will also mean that a user can run IC/DC before they deploy it to their target database. I would assume most users are already using a similar workflow (temp database -> deploy MADlib -> run IC -> deploy MADlib on actual target)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/426291179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/comments/426361664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/madlib/pull/325#issuecomment-426361664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/madlib/issues/325","id":426361664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjM2MTY2NA==","user":{"login":"iyerr3","id":2237447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2237447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3","html_url":"https://github.com/iyerr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iyerr3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T17:30:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T17:30:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The constraint with this strategy is that the IC/DC has to be run by a super-user. \r\nAdditionally, it won't test the deployment of MADlib in the actual user DB.

thank you for the comments.\r\nThe existing `minibatch_preprocessor` module outputs new columns called `dependent_varname` and `independent_varname` instead of the column names from the input table. The reason we did the same here is purely to conform with what is already in the other module. The other module allows expressions as input params (which may have been the reason behind a different column name in its output table), while this module does not explicitly support expressions. So, I do agree with your point about the output table column names, but I am just not sure how odd it would be to have the difference between the two modules. May be other folks could also weigh in to help us decide. Also, this module (`minibatch_preprocessor_dl`) is at early stage dev, so this will be a great time to try out options.\r\n\r\nRegarding your comment on the ordering of the two input params (`x` and `y`):\r\nThis is following the convention we have in every other MADlib module, namely, we first have the dependent variable followed by the independent variable in the input parameters list. If you'd like it to be the opposite, it might be a good idea to start a separate thread in the community mailing list to discuss it. It will break conformity if we change the order of the two variables only in this module. BTW, `2.0` release will be a good time to change it since that release would break backward compatibility.
