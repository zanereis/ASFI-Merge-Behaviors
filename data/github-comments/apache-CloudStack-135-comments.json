\nVery nice proposal this one. I have only very small suggestions, which are the following:\n- The method “videoCardConfig”, would be better if called “configureVideoCard”, normally I treat methods as actions, and as such, they normally start with a verb. This is cosmetics, but I think it helps to follow the code.\n- Method “modifyVmVideoCardVRamSize” does not need that throws Exception.\n- Would you mind creating a test case for “modifyVmVideoCardVRamSize”, it is a very simple integration test case.  It is pretty easy to do with mocks, if you need any help, just send me an email.\n- If you remove the “throws exception from modifyVmVideoCardVRamSize”, you can also remove from “setNewVRamSizeVmVideoCard”.\n- Would you mind creating test cases for the method “setNewVRamSizeVmVideoCard”?\n- Method “videoCardConfig”, if you removed the “throw Exception” from the above methods, you can remove the “Catch Exception from here”\n- And also, what about  test cases for the method “videoCardConfig”?\n- What about changing the verb of “configSpecVideoCardNewVRamSize” method to its complete form “configure”?\n- And finally, what about a test case for “configSpecVideoCardNewVRamSize”?\n\n@nvazquez great work, my suggestions are mostly aesthetics, but I think they can help improve this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/241815417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/241820015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1560#issuecomment-241820015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1560","id":241820015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTgyMDAxNQ==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T18:00:54Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T18:00:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM

Having said that, how do you feel about extracting the try/catch block to “getAllDeviceList”, then this method would not need to throw a checked exception. It could re-throw a runtime exception such as the CloudRuntime.\n\nFrom my understanding the test method “testStartVm3dgpuEnabled” is used to test the method “configureVideoCard”, right? What about changing that method name to “testConfigureVideoCard”?\n\nMoreover, do not you think that the method “configureVideoCard” needs at least two test cases? One that is already written, and the other to test the condition in which the  call “vmSpec.getDetails().containsKey(VmDetailConstants.SVGA_VRAM_SIZE)” returns false, and then the method “setNewVRamSizeVmVideoCard” is never called.\n\nThe same happens for the method “modifyVmVideoCardVRamSize”, I think it has another condition “videoCard.getVideoRamSizeInKB().longValue() == svgaVmramSize” to be tested.\n\nAnd finally, for the test method “testConfigureSpecVideoCardNewVRamSize”, what about using the “Mockito.InOrder” to assure that the methods are being called in the proper order. If someone changes that order of call in the future, that can affect the method behavior.\n\nI also have one small comment about the title of the PR and the commit message. “Improve performance” seems a little too vague for a title. The idea is very well explained on the PR, but the title does not reflect much. What about, “improve the performance of cloud-plugin-hypervisor-vmware” or something like that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/242209361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/242234805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1645#issuecomment-242234805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1645","id":242234805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjIzNDgwNQ==","user":{"login":"nathanejohnson","id":1360240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjAyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson","html_url":"https://github.com/nathanejohnson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanejohnson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T23:00:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T23:00:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jburwell as an update, the smoke test has completed successfully, and I'll let the component tests run overnight.
