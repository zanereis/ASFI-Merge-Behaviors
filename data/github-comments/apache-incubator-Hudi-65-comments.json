I see you are on Spark 2.4, which should work with larger than 2GB partitions. \r\n\r\nStill worth trying to increase the parallelism to 10K , may be.. it will ensure that the memory needed for each partition is lower (spark's own datastructures).. Also notice how much data it's shuffle spilling.. In all your runs, GC time is very high.. stage 4 75th percentile, for e.g 45 mins out of 3.5h. Consider giving large heap and tune gc bit? https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/Tuning+Guide has a sample to try.. \r\n\r\nLooking at stage 4: \r\nit's the actual write.. line [here](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/release-0.5.3/hudi-spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/HoodieSparkSqlWriter.scala#L262) triggers the DAG and counts the errors during write.. The workload distribution there is based on Spark sort's range partitioner.. seems like it does a reasonable job (2.5x swing between min and max records).. Guess it is what it is.. the sorting here is useful down the line as you perform upserts.. e.g if you have ordered keys , this pre-sort gives you very good index performance.\r\n\r\nLooking at stage 6:\r\nSeems like Spark lost a partition in the mean time and thus recomputed the RDD from scratch.. You can see one max task taking up 3hrs there.. My guess is its recomputing. if we make stage 4 more scalable, then I think this will also go away IMO.. Since shuffle uses local disk, I will also ensure cluster is big enough to hold the data needed for shuffle.. \r\n\r\nBtw all these are spark shuffle tuning, not Hudi specific per se.. and a 5.5TB shuffle is a good size :)  \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/648478687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/648481221","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1751#issuecomment-648481221","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1751","id":648481221,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODQ4MTIyMQ==","user":{"login":"bschell","id":8600774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8600774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell","html_url":"https://github.com/bschell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-23T23:33:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T23:33:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did not run into this when testing #1760 myself, I think it might be because we have internal changes for hive3.\r\n\r\nI just checked and it looks like we have calcite added and shaded in hudi-hive-bundle\r\n<dependency>  \r\n      <groupId>org.apache.calcite</groupId>  \r\n      <artifactId>calcite-core</artifactId>  \r\n      <version>1.16.0</version>  \r\n </dependency>\r\n\r\nI think you might also need to add and shade libfb303 for hive-sync\r\n<dependency>\r\n      <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>libfb303</artifactId>\r\n      <version>0.9.3</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\nWe had these dependency changes for hive3 compatibility, however, didn't realize this was needed for spark3 also.

@EdwinGuo @nsivabalan let's hash this out.. its an interesting one.. Although it may seem like we are computing the fully exploded RDD in both places.. if you look closely, we do\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> fileToComparisons = explodeRecordRDDWithFileComparisons(partitionToFileInfo, partitionRecordKeyPairRDD)\r\n>           .mapToPair(t -> t).countByKey();\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> countByKey() does not shuffle actual data, but just the counts per file.. We only pay the compute cost of exploding twice.. And all this to estimate the parallelism. given this is jsut an estimate, would it be better to introduce an option to simply down sample and estimate, rather than adding caching?\r\n> \r\n> eg.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> fileToComparisons = explodeRecordRDDWithFileComparisons(partitionToFileInfo, partitionRecordKeyPairRDD.sample(true, 0.1))\r\n>           .mapToPair(t -> t).countByKey();\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> would cut the cost down by 90% .. we need to adjust the computations in the map accordingly ofc..\r\n> Even spark sort does some kind of reservoir sampling.. So this could be a valid approach overall.\r\n> \r\n> What do you both think? I am bit concerned about caching this exploded RDD (that's why I chose to recompute to begin with)\r\n\r\nI can provide some performance comparison tomorrow.  fileComparisonsRDD is being compute in a different patterns within findMatchingFilesForRecordKeys and computeComparisonsPerFileGroup, so yes, countByKey is light in shuffle but could be heavy in IO for some of the cases. I agree StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER() could be heavy than recompute in some of the scenario, so let me conduct some performance testing and get back to you.\r\n\r\nRegarding sampling, what if some of the partitions are skewed? Will that cause more overhead than flush the file out?

I walked through this PR and found some common places we can share.\r\n> \r\n>     * Path filtering.\r\n> \r\n>     * User input paths handling and blob pattern.\r\n> \r\n>     * Schema provider.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I have a few questions.\r\n> \r\n> How should we define the user interface?\r\n> Soon, we will have Bootstrap view, read optimized view, snapshot(realtime) view, incremental view. I am wondering we should unified the query interface and handle all the file formats internally. How about this:\r\n> Snapshot view: Bootstrap files + non-hudi files + hudi files + hudi log\r\n> Read optimized: Bootstrap files + non-hudi files + hudi files\r\n> Incremental: incremental view on top of snapshot\r\n> \r\n> How should we split the filegroups?\r\n> Right now we already have 4 different filegroups. Once we add ORC support, there will be more. One of the cleanest ways I could find is to read each filegroup into RDD independently then union them together. In the current version of this PR, we handle regular parquet in `HudiBootstrapRDD`. The two disadvantages I could see:\r\n> \r\n>     * After we add ORC support, the complexity of this RDD would increase if we handle the ORC reading here too.\r\n> \r\n>     * IIUC, we didn't take the full advantage of the vectorized reader by using `ColumnBatch` directly. Merging probably requires reading row by row, but for regular parquet files, we can use the default parquet reader.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> If we can find a way to efficiently listing files in the driver, I think we can separate the bootstrap files from regular parquet and only use the `BootstrapRDD` to handle the files that need to be merged. Happy to discuss more here.\r\n\r\nThanks @garyli1019 for your review and bringing some interesting points.\r\n\r\nYes, I think the pieces you mentioned can be used by you later for the MOR datasource work.\r\n\r\nRegarding the user interface for the query your proposal makes sense to me in general. We can may be have it flushed out in more detail once our PRs are merged and happy to collaborate on that.\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggestion about using `sparks regular parquet reader` for regular hudi files and doing a `union` with bootstrapped files:\r\n- Complexity after ORC comes in: The current implementation is not very tightly coupled with parquet. IIUC for this implementation it should just be matter of initializing the readers with OrcFileFormat instead of ParquetFileFormat which shouldn't make life difficult. Happy to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\n- Full advantage of Vectorized Reader: I think I answered this in another comment you posted. At this point I need to do more research and gather datapoints if it is not utilizing `100%` of the advantages of `vectorized reading`. What I know for sure that the data from the file is read in a batch. Now, if I am loosing some performance in doing a row iteration over that batch I am not sure. But I believe spark regular readers, must be doing the batch to row conversion at some point of time. If you have more details on how spark does this, do let me know as it will be of great help. I will do some more research on this as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/651716297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/651718529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1243#issuecomment-651718529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1243","id":651718529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MTcxODUyOQ==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-30T10:52:46Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T10:52:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tooptoop4 trying to understand .. can you give us a set of reproducible steps? for e.g on the docker demo setup or somewhere we can repro and try?
