Using spark structured streaming\r\n2. Using deltastreamer continuous mode\r\n3. Using offline compactor utility (separate spark job) \r\n\r\nNow, to set the right configs, we need to learn more about the workload. Essentially, we want to pick the right compaction strategy depending on whether your udpates touch recent partitions or whether they are spread randomly across all partitions. Inline compaction is more useful in cases where you have small amount of late arriving data trickling into older partitions. Also checkout this [FAQ](https://hudi.apache.org/learn/faq/#how-do-i-run-compaction-for-a-mor-dataset).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you could avoid creating lots of small files. See here for mode details on small file handling: https://hudi.apache.org/learn/faq/#how-do-i-to-avoid-creating-tons-of-small-files\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1103889198/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1103893688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5375#issuecomment-1103893688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5375","id":1103893688,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5BzBS4","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-20T12:49:23Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T12:49:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Perhaps we can update this page with the DML/DDL for update/delete https://hudi.apache.org/docs/table_management\r\n@bhasudha @kywe665 thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1103893688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1103900228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5369#issuecomment-1103900228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5369","id":1103900228,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5BzC5E","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-20T12:56:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T12:56:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Guanpx Is this happening frequently?

However, in that scenario \"compaction\" happens with each write which needs a separate attention in terms of tuning the system\r\n 2) We have not been able to reproduce that issue for a single table with a single StreamingQuery. If we have the confirmation that this issue does not affect single table, we may try the approach of creating multiple spark applications per single Stream per SparkSession and run them on  the EMR cluster as separate jobs. However, given the fact that we have 80+ streams, it will create a much greater operational complexity (monitoring, restarting, deployment and coordination)\r\n 3)  Use MOR tables but disable the compaction execution in the same application and try to run in in a separate process.

\r\nThank you very much for your review， addressed all comments\r\nadd more test for nested rename operation.\r\n\r\nby HUDI-3855: we will rewrite old record before write it to parquet file\r\nfor schema evolution rename  scene， since old parquet file has old name， when we rewrite the old record with new schema， the value belong to old name will be missed  which lead to a serious problem\r\nfor example；\r\n1）now current cow hoodie table have a old parquet file which schema is： a int, b string\r\n2) we rename  a -> aa,  now new schema for hoodie table  will be :  aa int, b string\r\n3) let us insert new data to current hoodie table,  during the insert operation we need to read old record from old parquet file,\r\n**before HUDI-3855**:  we can read old record directly and write it to new parquet directly, rename operation has nothing influence to it\r\n**after HUDI-3855**: before we write old record, we need rewrite it with new schema,  now the schema of old record is: a int, b string but the new schema is: aa int, b string,  if we rewrite the old record forcely we will miss the value of column a since it is not exists in new

Further data is flowing through kafka which I'd like to ingest on the same table. Steps I've followed are\r\n1. spark.write to hudi\r\n2. Run deltastreamer with checkpoint in the format `kafkatopic,partition:0` I've kept 0 as offset as the kafka topic is newly created and I have all the data inside the topic when I run deltastreamer. Without specifying a checkpoint here fails deltastreamer with error saying `Unable to find previous checkpoint`.\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nHudi: 0.9.0\r\nAWS EMR: 6.5.0\r\n\r\nThis is the correct way to do it, yeah?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1105979967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1106003184","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/4230#issuecomment-1106003184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4230","id":1106003184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5B7ETw","user":{"login":"BalaMahesh","id":25053668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDUzNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25053668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh","html_url":"https://github.com/BalaMahesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BalaMahesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T04:49:20Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T04:49:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@yihua this seems not yet merged in the master, any idea when this will be merged into master, so that we can pull and try it out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1106003184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1106004999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5390#issuecomment-1106004999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5390","id":1106004999,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5B7EwH","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T04:53:25Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T04:53:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"a3b8d3fd07963241670317ddd199d3f42cdd1b6f\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=8224\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"a3b8d3fd07963241670317ddd199d3f42cdd1b6f\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* a3b8d3fd07963241670317ddd199d3f42cdd1b6f Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=8224) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n -

@codope sure I would like to work on the fix, please add me (apache username jqi) as a contributor.\r\n\r\nSo to to summarise the problem at hand, **ComplexKeyGenerator + no partition columns + HiveSync results in a broken Hive table**.\r\n* for non-partitoned table, ComplexKeyGenerator requires `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field` to be set to empty string\r\n* when `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.partition_fields` is not explicitly set, the inference function sets it to empty string\r\n  - as OP is using Hudi 0.10.1, which does not auto-infer, it is just a minor annoyance of having to configure things inconsistently\r\n* there does not exist a combination of flags to produce a working hive table\r\n\r\nI think the root cause is actually inconsistent handling of the degenerate case (empty string) between TypedProperties#getStringList and ComplexKeyGenerator.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1106809193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1106885785","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5366#issuecomment-1106885785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5366","id":1106885785,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5B-byZ","user":{"login":"bschell","id":8600774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8600774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell","html_url":"https://github.com/bschell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-22T21:32:18Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T21:32:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hudi-bot
