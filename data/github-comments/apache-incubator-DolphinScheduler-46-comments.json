Do we need a table to save the plugin instance information?\r\nI think the answer is 'yes'. IMO, we need 2 new tables, one is plugin_definition, the other is plugin_instance. For plugin_definition, it has id, ch_json, en_json, type(alert/job/...) fields. For plugin_instance, it save the values based on the definition.\r\n\r\n2. As mentioned above, we should save the plugin instance information. If the plugin has been removed, it should alert through log, mail, or something else.
