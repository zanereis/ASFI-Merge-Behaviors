My view on that is that it is insufficient and doesn't address what this issue is for.\n\nAs @jpinner just described, there is a lot of value in a Java backend, as well. I think if we were to prioritize, elimination of client side Scala needs to come first. I don't think that is sufficient, however. The process of producing Java backend components will be helpful in componentizing things such that the ecosystem can support both Java and Scala backends without making it mutually exclusive.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/122597430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/122608413","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/475#issuecomment-122608413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/475","id":122608413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjYwODQxMw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-19T00:33:36Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T00:33:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'm happy to see effort here!

thing that separates Zipkin from in-house applications is the need to replace backend technologies like Cassandra/MySQL/HBase. So simple flags might not be enough - e.g. MySQL may have other configuration options than Redis. In that regard, configuration as code is actually quite nice...\n\nThe way we configure Zipkin today (with Scala files and eval) is actually quite close to Spring XML configuration, except it's Scala, so we actually ship the Scala compiler with the Zipkin distribution (which of course increases artifact size and dependency tree quite a bit). I think we even load the Scala compiler in-memory as part of Zipkin, but I'm not quite sure how the eval module is written.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/122689128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/122703697","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/476#issuecomment-122703697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/476","id":122703697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjcwMzY5Nw==","user":{"login":"eirslett","id":1872593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1872593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett","html_url":"https://github.com/eirslett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eirslett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-19T20:37:36Z","updated_at":"2015-07-19T20:37:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can use `@Rule` in Scala if you use JUnitSuite:\nhttp://doc.scalatest.org/1.7/org/scalatest/junit/JUnitSuite.html\n\nThen you won't need the painful `$.MODULE$` stuff that comes from bad Java-Scala-interop...

What I would suggest also thinking about is what the criteria should be for something to be \"core\" versus not core. Cassandra/scribe are core more because of momentum it seems, should that always be the case?
