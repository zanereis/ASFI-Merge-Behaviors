Or is the ICLA only needed when one becomes a committer on a project …\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's only required by large contributions (and when becoming a committer). It does not apply to the reader we are primarily targeting here. The onus is on the committer reviewing to catch any such need.\r\n\r\n> the assignment of copyright and legal usage is implicit with a PR someone opens? \r\n\r\nCorrect. Our license states it. \r\n\r\nSignificant contributions that add new files, we want to ask the contributor to ensure they have added the license header to the files themselves (which creates the implicit acknowledgement). This is one of the reasons we have the rat check in the build/test process.\r\n\r\nWe probably need to be better at ensuring the committers when reviewing know this. But this PR template text is not the place for that, IMHO. (And nothing on the ICLA page goes into such detail anyway.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1235545964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1235739940","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1842#issuecomment-1235739940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1842","id":1235739940,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5Jp-Uk","user":{"login":"maedhroz","id":630857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz","html_url":"https://github.com/maedhroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T17:18:48Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T17:18:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-16679-4.1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1235739940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1235870815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1843#issuecomment-1235870815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1843","id":1235870815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5JqeRf","user":{"login":"maedhroz","id":630857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz","html_url":"https://github.com/maedhroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maedhroz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T20:26:37Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T20:26:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/maedhroz/cassandra?branch=CASSANDRA-16679-trunk","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1235870815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/1236017234","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/1825#issuecomment-1236017234","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/1825","id":1236017234,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM5JrCBS","user":{"login":"lmtrombone","id":10072771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDcyNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10072771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone","html_url":"https://github.com/lmtrombone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmtrombone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-03T01:18:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-03T01:18:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing
