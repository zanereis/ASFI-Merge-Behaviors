be able to change indention is very reasonable option, esp. as soon as you start working with Python.\n\n@astroshim It could be hard to implement per-interpreter as @Leemoonsoo suggests for now, so how about changing this implementat to per-notebook settings? I think it would be useful.\n\nMy only concern is whether it actually changes the paragraph code, or not.\n\nI have checked, and Ace editor we use in soft-tab configuration (although I can not find `useSoftTabs` anywhere), but the user-input `\\t` gets replaced by 4 spaces now.\n\nThen, how does [changing this setting](https://ace.c9.io/api/edit_session.html#EditSession.setTabSize) affect the paragraph (that already has no `\\t`)? Will it re-format whole paragraph by adding more whitespace chars (affects the diff)?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/227335710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/227337151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1030#issuecomment-227337151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1030","id":227337151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzMzNzE1MQ==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T04:23:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T04:23:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"👍  for having tests!\n\nTwo things:\n\n#### 1.
