All test classes in `./test/java/org/apache/flink/api/java/batch/table` are split into a validation and a plan test class. All tests are implemented in Scala and moved to the `./test/scala/` directory.\r\n\r\n- The validation tests contain the test methods which check for failing validation. These tests are all unit tests and are named like `CalcValidationTest`.\r\n- The plan test compare the logical plans of the string Table API and the expression Table API. These are also unit tests and named like `CalcPlanTest`. I would not merge these tests with the execution tests of the expression Table API but keep them separate.\r\n\r\nThe file `./test/java/org/apache/flink/api/java/batch/ExplainTest` can be removed.
