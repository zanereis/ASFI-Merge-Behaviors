It turned out that a Mesos framework needs to specify a `GPU_RESOURCES` capability if it wants to get resource offers that contain GPUs [[link]](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/gpu-support/#framework-capabilities). I managed to start TMs on the GPU-equipped agents by specifying a master flag `--fliter_gpu_resources` when starting the Mesos master. [MESOS-7576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7576) introduces `--filter_gpu_resources` and, when the flag is set to false, Mesos frameworks that do not have `GPU_RESOURCES` capability can receive offers that contain GPUs from the Mesos master. The problem seemed to be figured out without modifying Flink. \r\n\r\nThe reason I create [FLINK-8431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-8431) to allow to specify # gpus is that TMs are not going to see GPUs if they do not request GPUs explicitly and GPUs are isolated as shown in [link](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/gpu-support/#agent-flags).\r\n\r\nRegarding your question,\r\n> Is the original problem which we want to solve that Flink does not use agents which have GPU resources or that Flink cannot specify the number of GPUs it requires to run? It looks as if the PR solves the latter ...\r\n\r\nYes, the scope of FLINK-8431 and this PR is confined to the latter.\r\n\r\n> but I was wondering whether we shouldn't solve the former problem.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to take care of the former anymore because `GPU_RESOURCES` is going to be deprecated in favor of the reservation mechanism as shown in [link](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@mesos.apache.org/msg37571.html) and [MESOS-7576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7576). Thus, we need not split servers into two categories (CPU-only servers and GPU-equipped servers) anymore. Nevertheless, we need to specify `GPU_RESOURCES` until it is completely deprecated in Mesos-2.x. To this end, I add a `GPU_RESOURCES` capability if # gpus are larger than 0.\r\n\r\nFor those who are in a situation in which JM does not get offers that contains GPUs, I'd like to suggest to restart the Mesos master with `--filter_gpu_resources` set to false as explained above.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/361451834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/361454817","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5375#issuecomment-361454817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5375","id":361454817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTQ1NDgxNw==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-30T02:18:33Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T02:18:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @tillrohrmann .
