so the problem is the bookies didn't start correctly. there is a mechanism in bookkeeper to prevent bookies startup with malformed state which is called cookie. this ensures disk layout and bookie identifier unchanged between different bookie restart cycles. \r\n\r\nin this case, since we changed the bookie to use hostname, it changes the bookie identifier. bookkeeper prevents its startup. what I would suggest to do: \r\n\r\non each bookie node, run \"bin/bookkeeper shell bookieformat\". this would reinitialize your bookie

@vli02. The problem is that to build a \"fat\" `libpulsar.so` that contains all dependencies, these dependencies need to be compiled with `-fPIC` .\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that is not the case with most library that ship in Ubuntu/RHEL. \r\n\r\nFor example, for Python binding we have a Docker image with all the dependencies compiled correctly. \r\n\r\nSame for building statically linked RPM package (there is a PR in progress at https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/pull/1963). The Docker image, based on Centos 7, is already available as `apachepulsar/pulsar-build:centos-7`.

RuntimeFactory is used on a per function instance basis.  RuntimeFactory is not used across different functions.  A typical work flow for when you are submitting a function to a worker is the function actioner will create a runtime spawner for a function instance (usually to spawn a process) and the Java instance main will also create a runtime spawner to spawn a thread. When the runtime spawner closes, we need the runtime factory to close to especially if the runtime factory is the thread runtime factory (process runtime factory close is a no op) because it needs to close the pulsar client initialized in the thread runtime factory.\r\n\r\n#1833 only closes JavaInstanceMain (main function for function instance process) when it detects that the worker is dead.

I think this will make it easier to maintain and add support for other platforms. Also, in the future there can be a couple of value files for each platform.

 RuntimeFactory is used on a per function instance basis. RuntimeFactory is not used across different functions.\r\n\r\nUmm.. really? Isn't RuntimeFactory created one per worker because it's job is to create Runtime for instance. and it seems it's also implemented in such a manner where worker creates one RuntimeFactory which will be used to create runtime for new function-instance.\r\n\r\n[WorkerService](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-functions/worker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/functions/worker/WorkerService.java#L107) -> creates [FunctionRuntimeManager](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-functions/worker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/functions/worker/FunctionRuntimeManager.java#L110) -> creates `RuntimeFactory` which is being passed to [FunctionActioner](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-functions/worker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/functions/worker/FunctionRuntimeManager.java#L122) and FunctionActioner uses RuntimeFactory to create runtime for a function-instance.\r\n\r\nNow, if I delete/update a function then it closes a RuntimeFactory and it's pulsar-client so, any new function will be failed with given exception: `Client is already closed`. ??\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/398593971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/398610345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/1922#issuecomment-398610345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1922","id":398610345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODYxMDM0NQ==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T03:09:31Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T03:09:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"retest this please","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/398610345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/398614518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/1988#issuecomment-398614518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1988","id":398614518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODYxNDUxOA==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T03:39:54Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T03:39:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agree with @rdhabalia on this one.

I don't think we should be creating the Pulsar client in the ThreadRuntimeFactory then.  For running function instances as a separate process via ProcessRuntimeFactory the workflow is as such:\r\nFunctionRuntimeManager creates ProcessRuntimeFactory and is passed to FunctionActioner. FunctionActioner will create a RuntimeSpawner that creates a new process via ProcessRuntimeFactory.  The process will run JavaInstanceMain which creates a ThreadRuntimeFactory and a RuntimeSpawner to spawn a thread runtime.  \r\n\r\nWhen JavaInstanceMain needs to commit suicide it should have a way to close PulsarClient that is used in the thread runtime.  The way to do that currently is closing ThreadRuntimeFactory, but as @rdhabalia pointed out that will cause problems for running functions as a thread.  We need a way to close the pulsar client when the function instance is running via process and not when the function instance is running as a thread in the worker service process","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/398619633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
