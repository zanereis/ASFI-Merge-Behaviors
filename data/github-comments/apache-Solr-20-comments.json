I expect that there will be a new jetty.xml when I upgrade -- I use the service installer, which means that the upgrade will create an entirely new program directory and update the symlink.  If instead of upgrading, I reinstall the same version with the -f flag, I think that would probably overwrite jetty.xml ... but I have never tried installing the same version.\r\n\r\nI do not know what typically happens when upgrading a docker setup, as I have never installed Solr that way.  Does it create a new container that utilizes the same solr home that the old container was connected to?  I suspect that jetty.xml edits are never propagated to the new version when doing an upgrade in a docker setup, the same as upgrading a non-docker setup with the service installer script.\r\n\r\nWhat would it realistically take to upgrade to Jetty 11 instead of 10?  Is that even possible without an extensive overhaul?  I see on the jetty website that 11 uses the new jakartaee.servlet.* packages and servlet API 5, while Jetty 10 uses the same javax.servlet.* packages as 9, and targets servlet API 4.  I would hope that version 11 has shim classes that allow webapps made for 9 to run.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1203238907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1203243791","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/585#issuecomment-1203243791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/585","id":1203243791,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5HuAsP","user":{"login":"elyograg","id":4984827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODQ4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4984827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg","html_url":"https://github.com/elyograg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elyograg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-02T21:44:17Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T21:44:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We might want to provide mechanisms to make the most common jetty.xml edits configurable, which mostly eliminates that problem.

Based on my very limited understanding of PRS, it's a part of the state of a collection no matter how it's retrieved (via ZK or via SolrClient based ClusterStateProvider).  Am I right @noblepaul @chatman  ?\r\n\r\nI do like your suggestion of those 3 \"Props\" classes for constants.  How do we get there from here?  Directly, even if it changes import statement in lots more classes (I would assume)?  This is the easiest path.  Or do we leave that for another JIRA issue (soon) and for now just remove the nocommits about this to make precommit happy?  Also relatively easy but leaves some WIP.  Or go part way here & now -- add the new classes & constants but only use them in solrj-zookeeper right now and then migrate the rest in another issue?  More work.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that this new separation did move some tests to solrj-zookeeper but it's only four -- that's it.  Many solrj tests indirectly use ZK and I suppose that's okay.  There is a compile time dependency on ZK from solrj tests that is unfortunate but couldn't be avoided in a few cases (without investing additional work):\r\n* StreamingTest.streamLocalTests  calls `zkStateReader.forceUpdateCollection`\r\n* TestCloudSolrClientConnections calls cluster.getZkClient()\r\n* org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.HttpClusterStateSSLTest#testHttpClusterStateWithSSL calls cluster.getZkClient() \r\nPerhaps these might even move but on the other hand, it's not some big deal to add an explicit dependency on solrj tests to ZK when ZK is definitely already there at runtime via the solrj-zookeeper dependency.\r\n\r\nThere is a weird dependency check problem that I can't figure out:\r\n```\r\nExecution failed for task ':solr:solrj-zookeeper:analyzeTestClassesDependencies'.\r\n> Dependency analysis found issues.\r\n  usedUndeclaredArtifacts\r\n   - org.apache.solr:solrj-zookeeper:10.0.0-SNAPSHOT@\r\n```\r\nSo solrj-zookeeper's tests depend on solrj-zookeeper.

Big thing missing is an update to the ref guide, probably function-queries.adoc or spatial-search.adoc?\r\n> \r\n\r\nWhen i get a moment I'll ad something to spatial-search.adoc perhaps?\r\n\r\n> Another thought I had was how exactly do we expect users to use this. If they're still going to be providing indexable data in lat/long and also expecting lat/long for output information, then will this really be faster than using haversine? Or does it move the computation to the indexing side when we only have to do it once, so over multiple queries the total time taken gets reduced...\r\n\r\nThis moves most of the calculation to the indexing side. We then only need to calculate an n-vector for the input lat/lon. The sorting can then be done on the dot-product alone. Users can optionally index spatial data in multiple formats (e.g. LanLonSpatialField and NVectorField) should they find that a performance boost. N-Vector provides faster comparison  (and great circle distance calculation) than haversine, additionally without caveats, or accuracy degradation, for calculations at poles/equator
