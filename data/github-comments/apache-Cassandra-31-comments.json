work on this patch everyone; very impressed with it.

This one might not be necessary in a post-TCM world actually; happy to learn if so. :)\r\n3. I don't recall seeing logic when I reviewed the patch to defer to a Guardrail being set in the event you tried to add a Constraint on that existing table. Did I miss that, or did we drop that (believe that was in the CEP)\r\n4.

hello, @bbotella , do you think we need to add some test for DescribeStatementTest to see if the out put of the describe table is what we need ? Besides, Do we need cqlsh to support the ability to automatically complete the corresponding keywords for constraints and add the corresponding unit test? like [here](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/46ef00a31594312403e8b42e66ae9354e7bf87ef#diff-2a60598dcb20f6075ab3bc1552b9908b20404f3d19aa7f3fcede0f4ffd15923aR1308) . @smiklosovic @jmckenzie-dev WDYT ?\r\n\r\nI know there's some on the project that would advocate for adding a test to ensure the output of DESCRIBE TABLE meets some very ultra-specific string output for every given new feature or change. I've never been too convinced of the necessity of that, but adding something to `DescribeStatementTest.java` to cover the constraint output case would cover it if you want to.\r\n\r\nHonestly, we probably _should_ do things like that and this is something I just need to come around on. I find those kinds of tests a real slog to both write and to debug (just annoying nit-picky string formatting stuff that snapshots the state of things at a moment in time, etc)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2613220127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2613221298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3562#issuecomment-2613221298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3562","id":2613221298,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM6bwpey","user":{"login":"jmckenzie-dev","id":6588455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/jmckenzie-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmckenzie-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-24T19:17:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T19:17:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 from me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2613221298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/2613226187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3562#issuecomment-2613226187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/3562","id":2613226187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmWM6bwqrL","user":{"login":"yifan-c","id":52585731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTg1NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52585731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c","html_url":"https://github.com/yifan-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifan-c/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-24T19:21:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T19:21:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will take another pass, since there are considerable amount of changes since my last review.
