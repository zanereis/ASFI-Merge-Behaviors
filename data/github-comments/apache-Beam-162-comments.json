a lot for working on this, @JingsongLi. 😃 \r\n\r\nI have one quick initial comment: `FlinkNonSortedCombineRunner` is a (somewhat different) reimplementation of `ReduceFnRunner` with the difference that `ReduceFnRunner` does the merging of windows on the fly, while processing elements, whereas `FlinkNonSortedCombineRunner` does two passes over the input elements, one for determining the merged windows and another one for processing the data which requires materialising all input elements in a list because Flink only allows iterating over the input once.\r\n\r\nI think we should either change `FlinkNonSortedCombineRunner` to also only require one pass or reuse `ReduceFnRunner` directly. This is a quick sketch of what that would look like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class FlinkMergingNonShuffleReduceFunction<\r\n    K, InputT, AccumT, OutputT, W extends BoundedWindow>\r\n    extends RichGroupReduceFunction<WindowedValue<KV<K, InputT>>, WindowedValue<KV<K, OutputT>>> {\r\n\r\n  private final AppliedCombineFn<K, InputT, AccumT, OutputT> combineFn;\r\n\r\n  private final WindowingStrategy<Object, W> windowingStrategy;\r\n\r\n  private final Map<PCollectionView<?>, WindowingStrategy<?, ?>> sideInputs;\r\n\r\n  private final SerializedPipelineOptions serializedOptions;\r\n\r\n  public FlinkMergingNonShuffleReduceFunction(\r\n      AppliedCombineFn<K, InputT, AccumT, OutputT> keyedCombineFn,\r\n      WindowingStrategy<Object, W> windowingStrategy,\r\n      Map<PCollectionView<?>, WindowingStrategy<?, ?>> sideInputs,\r\n      PipelineOptions pipelineOptions) {\r\n\r\n    this.combineFn = keyedCombineFn;\r\n\r\n    this.windowingStrategy = windowingStrategy;\r\n    this.sideInputs = sideInputs;\r\n\r\n    this.serializedOptions = new SerializedPipelineOptions(pipelineOptions);\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void reduce(\r\n      Iterable<WindowedValue<KV<K, InputT>>> elements,\r\n      final Collector<WindowedValue<KV<K, OutputT>>> out) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n    FlinkSideInputReader sideInputReader =\r\n        new FlinkSideInputReader(sideInputs, getRuntimeContext());\r\n\r\n    final Iterator<WindowedValue<KV<K, InputT>>> iterator = elements.iterator();\r\n\r\n    // get the first value, we need this for initializing the state internals with the key.\r\n    // we are guaranteed to have a first value, otherwise reduce() would not have been called.\r\n    final WindowedValue<KV<K, InputT>> currentValue = iterator.next();\r\n    final K key = currentValue.getValue().getKey();\r\n\r\n    final InMemoryStateInternals<K> stateInternals = InMemoryStateInternals.forKey(key);\r\n\r\n    // Used with Batch, we know that all the data is available for this key.
