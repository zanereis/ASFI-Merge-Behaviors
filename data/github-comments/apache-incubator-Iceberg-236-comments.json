another pass:\r\n\r\n- Added `_OrderedChunkedArrayConsumer` so we don't have to reallocate and sort into a single array. We can even further optimize this by using a tree structure of iterators. But the [ChunkedArray is currently not iterable]( https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34495), so we would need to wrap the array with `iter(..)`. Also, there is no `.peek` functionality in Python, so we would have to add [another wrapper for that](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.peekable). I expect the number of deleted files that affect a data file to be fairly small, so I think we're good here.\r\n- Fixed a rather nasty bug where we first filtered a table, and then applied the positional deletes. This would mess up the positions. Instead, when there are positional deletes, I first read all the data, and then filter on the positions. Of course, this breaks the predicate pushdown and we'll read everything into Arrow buffers.\r\n- Added a few tests.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great to merge https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6398 first so we can add some integration tests.\r\n\r\nMost optimizations are in now, except filtering on the [`row` struct](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#position-delete-files).

If not set we could emit a warning on the first time a datetime is being created with an implicit timezone. A warning has a nice property that it is [only emitted once](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html): _Repetitions of a particular warning for the same source location are typically suppressed._\r\n\r\n> We could make helper methods for creating time literals, like `timestamp(iso8601: str, defaultZone: str = \"+00:00\") -> int` that make it clear what is happening by having a defined default\r\n\r\nI'm less in favor of this one because I think this manifests mostly around the filter API;\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntbl.scan(\r\n    row_filter=GreaterThanOrEqual(\"tpep_pickup_datetime\", \"2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\")\r\n).to_arrow()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHave the API As:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntbl.scan(\r\n    row_filter=\"tpep_pickup_datetime >= '2022-01-01T00:00:00'\"\r\n).to_arrow()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it is easy to forget the `+00:00` and then a user would need to look up the format which is not very user-friendly. A logical evolution is also:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntbl.scan(\r\n    row_filter=\"tpep_pickup_datetime >= '2022-01-01'\")\r\n).to_arrow()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `tpep_pickup_datetime` is a datetime column, so the literal would be cast to a datetime. This is also where you don't have any timezone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1460732865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1460748844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6799#issuecomment-1460748844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/6799","id":1460748844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85XEUIs","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-08T19:39:03Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T19:39:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue can you please review this again? @nastra has approved it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1460748844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
