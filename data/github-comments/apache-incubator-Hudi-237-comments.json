hi.\r\nafter I had a chat with you yesterday, I did some self-question / answer, and also some investigation in Glue and Hudi and Hive code base.\r\n\r\nHere is the my self-question and thought. ( FYI, I don’t have much detailed knowledge about hive and hudi code base )\r\n\r\nAnd, my conclusion is that I think there is issue in Hudi, not really in AWS Glue.\r\n\r\n**Q1. What is the issue?**\r\nA. Metadata sync failed because incorrect MetaStoreClient is used.\r\n( org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.SessionHiveMetaStoreClient )\r\n\r\n**Q2. What is the expected MetaStoreClient?**\r\nA. AWSCatalogMetastoreClient ( code )\r\n\r\n**Q3. which Hudi version works and not works?**\r\nA.\r\nHudi 0.10.1 works\r\nHudi 0.11 doesn’t works ( Spark2, Spark3 )\r\n\r\n**Q4. How is AWSCatalogMetastoreClient picked when using AWS Glue Catalog?**\r\nA. By overriding the config spark.hadoop.hive.metastore.client.factory.class\r\n( spark.hadoop.hive.metastore.client.factory.class=com.amazonaws.glue.catalog.metastore.AWSGlueDataCatalogHiveClientFactory )\r\n\r\n**Q5. Does the Glue set the spark.hadoop.hive.metastore.client.factory.class?**\r\nA. Yes it does regardless the Hudi version.\r\n\r\n**Q6. Does AWS Glue care if I am using Hudi 0.10.1 or 0.11?**\r\nA. it shouldn’t. It might not be there concern.\r\n\r\n**Q7. What datasource am I using?**\r\nA. Spark\r\n\r\n**Q8. When using Spark, which module create SyncClient?**\r\nA. It starts from HoodieSparkSqlWriter.scala (metaSync method ). also there is now module SyncUtilHelpers.java\r\n\r\n**Q9. Any change in MetaStoreClient in Hudi?**\r\nA. Yes. new feature is added.\r\nhttps://hudi.apache.org/docs/syncing_aws_glue_data_catalog\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1137575389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1137733672","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5484#issuecomment-1137733672","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5484","id":1137733672,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5D0HAo","user":{"login":"tchunchu","id":17171456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTcxNDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17171456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu","html_url":"https://github.com/tchunchu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tchunchu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T19:00:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T19:00:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@xushiyan  I tried with sync mode as glue and it also didn't work. \r\n\"hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.mode\" : \"glue\"\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-sync/hudi-hive-sync/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hive/HiveSyncConfig.java\r\n\r\n{\"--sync-mode\"}, description = \"Mode to choose for Hive ops.
