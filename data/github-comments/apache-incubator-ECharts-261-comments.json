我刚刚试了下，我在你说的位置拿到了最新的位置数据。怎么写到option 里面呢？是直接操作 `forceModel.ecModel.option.series` 吗？\r\n\r\n另外一个问题是，当x y 位置初始化好了后（`stopped==true`）有哪个`event` / `callback` 能触发？我想的是最初用 `force`，但是当初始化好了后，改成 `none`，提供 `x`, `y` 坐标，这样我可以保存位置数据，下次load 的时候就是上次结束的位置。\r\n\r\n谢谢！","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/586520248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/586565580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12149#issuecomment-586565580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12149","id":586565580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjU2NTU4MA==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-15T07:56:16Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T07:56:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
