Each table has some kind of watermark strategy which might be conservative (little late data, higher latency) or eager (more late data, less latency). Users want to query these streaming tables but might need more conservative or more eager watermarks. Of course they don't want to register the tables again (with all the additional information required) to just adapt the watermarks for their use case. With this parameter, they can simply adjust the watermarks of the already registered tables.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this, I noticed that it would make sense to optionally add the name of table on which the watermark manipulation should be applied. Some table might already have good watermarks while others need to be adjusted.\r\nSo we would have two configuration methods:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// adjusts the watermarks of all input tables\r\n def withLateDataTimeOffset(lateDataTimeOffset: Time): StreamQueryConfig\r\n\r\n// adjusts the watermarks of a specific input table\r\n def withLateDataTimeOffset(table: String, lateDataTimeOffset: Time): StreamQueryConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @sunjincheng121 and @wuchong?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314127106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314175638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3511#issuecomment-314175638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3511","id":314175638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDE3NTYzOA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-10T17:23:53Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T17:23:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@heytitle apologies for the long delay.

There are several steps to proceed with:\r\n- rebase to master\r\n- fix checkstyle warnings against the new \"strict checkstyle\"\r\n- implement code generation for `FixedLengthRecordSorter`\r\n\r\nRather than extending `NormalizedKeySorter`, we could pull the compare and swap functions out of `MemorySegment` into an interface with a default implementation moved from `NormalizedKeySorter` and `FixedLengthRecordSorter`. There is overlap in that the `normalizedKeyFullyDetermines` case of `NormalizedKeySorter` results in the same operations as in `FixedLengthRecordSorter`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314175638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/314179438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4183#issuecomment-314179438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4183","id":314179438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDE3OTQzOA==","user":{"login":"sunjincheng121","id":22488084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDg4MDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22488084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121","html_url":"https://github.com/sunjincheng121","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunjincheng121/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-10T17:37:57Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T17:37:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, @fhueske you are right, we must define watermark for each table.
