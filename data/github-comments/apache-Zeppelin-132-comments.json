Thanks! \r\nCurrently dynamic form itself is working in report mode by pressing `Enter` after the selected value changed. But the problem is it's not intuitive. Ppl don't know what they should do after changing value since it's automatically run before, but now it's not.\r\nI created an another PR to improve the dynamic form behaviour in #2100. Can you take a look? I'm not sure which one is better. Maybe I can integrate two.. But it'll be better to get more feedbacks!
