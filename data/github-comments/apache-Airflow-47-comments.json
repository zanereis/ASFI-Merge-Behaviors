I always though a DAG would either be scheduled, or externally triggered, not a mix of both, but we never made that a real restriction, so I'm sure some people mix both.\n\nIf that is the case that we want to support both, the notion of depends_on_past become mushy, where maybe people may expect or desire either a depends_on_past_schedule or depends_on_past_run.\n\nSince it's pretty edge-case (combo of both mixed scheduled AND depend_on_past=True) and unclear what the desired behavior might be, I'd vote to do something simple in terms of logic and document it clearly.

I'd rather force not override \"already running\", unless it kills and cleans up first, and that's tricky, we'd probably need a new state \"shutdown_and_restart\", where the task picks up the shutdown, handles it, and marks itself as runnable somehow\n- SLA is really just about whether effectively you got your task to succeed by a certain time. IE: If `core_data` isn't deliver by 9AM, we have missed our SLA and should get an email\n- DAG pause evaluation is more efficient at a higher level, but I totally see how it makes the dependency engine nice to have it all in one place. People have asked for a task level pause state before and that would belong here nicely. Maybe DAG pause/unpause could effectively toggle all tasks level pause when that's implemented, but that's for another PR. I wouldn't worry about scheduler performance as we'll soon run multiple multiprocessing schedulers.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215273321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215274879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1435#issuecomment-215274879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1435","id":215274879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTI3NDg3OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T00:46:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T00:46:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`ignore_depends_on_past` is kind of a nasty thing, it's mostly there to allow for remote backfills to allow for the start_date of the backfill to run\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215274879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215277705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1435#issuecomment-215277705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1435","id":215277705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTI3NzcwNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T01:04:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T01:05:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I haven't gotten to the bottom of this thought yet, but I feel like `get_dep_statuses` should only receive a task instance and maybe some `run_context` object (TBD).

thanks for the in-depth review!\n\n> I'd rather force not override \"already running\", unless it kills and cleans up first, and that's tricky, we'd probably need a new state \"shutdown_and_restart\", where the task picks up the shutdown, handles it, and marks itself as runnable somehow\n\nIs the scenario you are worrying about (two workers running the same task instance) already possible? For example if a worker's communication with the DB gets interrupted, then the scheduler assigns the task instance to a new worker, and then the communication between the initial worker and the DB resumes.\n\n> SLA is really just about whether effectively you got your task to succeed by a certain time. IE: If core_data isn't deliver by 9AM, we have missed our SLA and should get an email\n\nThis makes sense. I misspoke in the PR description though, SLAs should still be sent, the difference would be the SLA email would now omit task instances in the dagrun that didn't succeed for reasons other than depends_on_past not being met (e.g. a task that couldn't run because it's pool was full won't get reported in the email). I think I'm going to just include all tasks that don't have a successful status in the SLA miss email, even those stuck on depends_on_past to align with your criteria (if the task caused core_data to not be delivered by 9AM the task caused the DAG to miss it's SLA regardless of it's depends_on_past_dependency), plus is stops treating depends_on_past differently from the other dependencies like the pool being full. LMK what you think.\n\n> DAG pause evaluation is more efficient at a higher level, but I totally see how it makes the dependency engine nice to have it all in one place. People have asked for a task level pause state before and that would belong here nicely. Maybe DAG pause/unpause could effectively toggle all tasks level pause when that's implemented, but that's for another PR. I wouldn't worry about scheduler performance as we'll soon run multiple multiprocessing schedulers.\n\nAgreed about the efficiency, was going to look into caching if this causes perf issues.\n\n> ignore_depends_on_past is kind of a nasty thing, it's mostly there to allow for remote backfills to allow for the start_date of the backfill to run\n\nThe newfound power of the force flag could be used instead of ignore_depends_on_past, but making \"force\" the default for every backfill could potentially be a bit dangerous as users could e.g. unintentionally force run over a large range of already successful tasks in a backfill or violate a pool constraint. If you have any ideas let me know.\n\n> I haven't gotten to the bottom of this thought yet, but I feel like get_dep_statuses should only receive a task instance and maybe some run_context object (TBD). I'd hate to add a new run_context item and have to go copy paste it into all these methods that are not using it...\n> Trying to sort out the other args of get_dep_statuses:\n> session: needed, let's use @utils.provide_session\n> include_queued: haven't dug in this yet\n> ignore_depends_on_past: maybe part of some run context, it's related to the backfill's start_date\n> flag_upstream_failed: this should be insulated in some routine that's not dependency related, maybe something like \"infer_states\", that would just take care of all the cases where the state can just be inferred and assigned in place, without actually running the task\n\nAgreed about not passing in a bunch of different flags. There is actually a TODO above that part of the code in the PR to use a context parameter instead (it will be addressed in this PR).\n\nFor the flag upstream_failed I would prefer to leave the fix for another PR since it was an existing hack and the cope of this PR is already a bit dangerously large.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215288030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215295282","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1435#issuecomment-215295282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1435","id":215295282,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTI5NTI4Mg==","user":{"login":"landscape-bot","id":10010231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDEwMjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10010231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/landscape-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landscape-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T02:55:49Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T02:55:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[![Code

see my one comment about the error always printing. Also, I tried running this in my local env with no key in the Airflow connection (in other words, using global `gcloud auth`) and got the following message: \n\n```\nINFO:root:Getting connection using `gcloud auth` user, since no service_account/key_path are defined for hook.\nWARNING:oauth2client.util:__init__() takes at most 2 positional arguments (3 given)\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure if this matters (or even if it's on the Airflow side), since it appears to read/write the logs to GCS just fine.\n\nOne last thought -- would be great to bump this up to oauth2client 2.0 compatibility. Maybe not this PR but at some point. This is the offending line: `from oauth2client.client import SignedJwtAssertionCredentials, GoogleCredentials`. I think the signed credentials just need to be pulled from a different module but I don't know the library well so I'm not sure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215538712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/215539760","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1448#issuecomment-215539760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1448","id":215539760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTUzOTc2MA==","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-28T19:41:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T19:41:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just saw your message on the Apache issue that you're already looking at compatibility issues :) Sorry for being repetitive.

is a nuance but SubDags don't get scheduled; therefore they ignore parameters like schedule_interval. Instead, what happens is your SubDagOperator forces the subdag to run when the SDO is run. That's why you're not seeing the behavior you expect.\n\nYou might want to use a `TimeSensor` instead -- that will block until a certain time of day. However it may require some modification for multiple runs per day. Have a look at the code in `operators/sensors.py`. \n\nWe are moving all issues to Apache, so I'm going to close this issue, but if you have further questions please pick up over
