So, when a new compression is supported in hbase, then Trafodion needs to be updated to allow this compression type.  I understand that the metadata would contain the incorrect information in hbase options because hbase allowed it. However it should cause no harm in Trafodion processing of the table. Isn't it?\r\n\r\nIf so and if hbase options are just pass through to hbase from Trafodion, then personally I think we should let hbase do the checking.  If these options are used to influence Trafodion processing then it makes sense to do the validation in

you for the comments @selvaganesang. I don't quite understand the statement \"However it should cause no harm in Trafodion processing of the table. Isn't it\". Can you please explain? Maybe an example to illustrate your concern will help.\r\n\r\nIf you are saying that it is acceptable to not raise an error for the following statement, I don't agree.\r\ncreate table t (a int) hbase_options (compression = 'snapy').\r\nIt is preferable in my opinion to fail fast. If this statement were to succeed, the user will imagine that the table is compressed while is its not. It could be a while before the problem is detected.\r\n\r\nThe way current code is constructed, if new compression options are supported by HBase, new code will have to added in Trafodion. This PR does not really make that any worse. \r\n\r\nIn createTable API that is used in HBaseClient.java, we have to pass in an enum for the compression setting. Thought I would not want to, I don't  think there is an API to just pass the string that we got from the user.

A query in some regression test would be nice for a later delivery.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/pull/975#issuecomment-282048105>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AMa1IAH_rA0MBoYSzQMrJU9pKv2uWIOzks5rfbc2gaJpZM4MI6Dc>.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282057554/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282074965","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/965#issuecomment-282074965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/965","id":282074965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjA3NDk2NQ==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T18:17:26Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T18:17:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, just wanted to add my two cents. You are both bringing up very good points. My preference would also be that we just pass HBase table options through to HBase and let it do the checking. However, from what I heard and saw, HBase does not do a good job with such checking. We have seen HBase options that are accepted by HBase but then cause the region server to hang, e.g. when specifying an invalid split policy. So, I guess that Suresh's approach is the lesser of the two evils. Note, however, that it may still not prevent a problem in cases where - for example - the specified compression library is not installed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282074965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282080051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/978#issuecomment-282080051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/978","id":282080051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjA4MDA1MQ==","user":{"login":"sureshsubbiah","id":3596671,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTY2NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3596671?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshsubbiah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshsubbiah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T18:36:06Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T18:36:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282080051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282115853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/965#issuecomment-282115853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/965","id":282115853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjExNTg1Mw==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T20:46:34Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T20:46:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with @zellerh.

A few specific responses\r\n\r\n1) \" that it may still not prevent a problem in cases where - for example - the specified compression library is not installed\". This is now addressed in Trafodion. We call an HBase API to check if library is installed and accessible by hbase before creating the table. This was done in https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/pull/949\r\n\r\n2) HBase does do some checking of create option. It is more detailed than what we do. I am not sure if it does all the small things we do though. However it has to be enabled by setting the attribute  hbase.table.sanity.checks in the global configuration. From what I can tell currently HDP does this by default while CDH does not. Please see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10591\r\n\r\n3) There is a basic problem that is currently best addressed in our layer. We get a String from the user in the CREATE statement, specifying compression type. We have to pass in an Enum value to HBase when we use the HBaseAdmin create API. When mapping the string to an enum, if we find that there is a no mapping possible, then it seems best that Trafodion raise the error. I suppose in the future we could extend the HBase API to take a string and push this error handling to HBase too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282152741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/282169329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/977#issuecomment-282169329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/977","id":282169329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjE2OTMyOQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T00:46:03Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T00:46:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New

always, Suresh is much better informed than I am, thanks for the clarification!
