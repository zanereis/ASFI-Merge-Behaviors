Loadbalancer, will add the commit. For the pre built image https://github.com/k8s-for-greeks/docker-cassandra-k8s, this has exactly same docker file as we referred others. In the docker file, there  is a check if the image is being built for production usage, there is a script for removal of a folder which contains cqlsh, nodetool etc, only if the image is being built for  development, then the removal does not happen. All the published images on quay are for production, and hence we cannot do a cqlsh for data load and show-health to contain nodetool. in our custom built image we have removed this logic of checking for production or development, hence it works seamlessly on our custom image.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/291843622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/291902177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2432#issuecomment-291902177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2432","id":291902177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTkwMjE3Nw==","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-05T15:39:29Z","updated_at":"2017-04-05T15:39:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R:
