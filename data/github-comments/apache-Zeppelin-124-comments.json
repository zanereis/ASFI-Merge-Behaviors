Because it runs on browser. This enable us to combine existing backend interpreters with spell like\r\n\r\nSo i tried following but couldn't make it work. Am i missing something?\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/22355380/9d932722-e46d-11e6-8d80-af5e7657d910.png)\r\n\r\n### Configuring Display order of Spell doesn't make sense\r\n\r\nEnabled spells are displayed in 'Helium' menu like below.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/22355499/37ea7ef6-e46e-11e6-8a41-8083f836d07e.png)\r\n\r\nWhich is designed to change display order of visualization package when they displayed in chart selector inside of the paragraph.\r\nAs far as i understand, Spell does not have to be listed in the chart selector and does not need to change order. So i think reordering should be only for 'Visualization' type package.\r\n\r\nSpell can create another section just below enabled visualization buttons, to list enabled spells.\r\n\r\n### Display keyword of the spell\r\n\r\nEach spell has keyword to invoke. For example `markdown-spell`'s keyword is `%markdown`, `flowchart-spell`'s keyword is `%flowchart`. However, i couldn't find these keyword anywhere but the source code.\r\n\r\nSo it'll be nice if 'Helium' menu displays keyword of the Spell type packages. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Example for example spells \r\n\r\nIf there's some informations or example that how to use (syntax, etc) included example Spells, (e.g. in description section or somewhere) it'll be more convenient. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I like this feature, it is simple to create, publish, install and use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/275552972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/275556437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1598#issuecomment-275556437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1598","id":275556437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTU1NjQzNw==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-27T00:24:52Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T00:24:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\\cc
