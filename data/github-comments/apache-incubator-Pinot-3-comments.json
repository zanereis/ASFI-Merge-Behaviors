This conversion should be applicable to both realtime and offline. We added transformer to transform data types. We should add this logic to the same place.\nI am thinking if its better to templatize the converter Converter<IncomingPinotDataType, OutgoingPinotDataType>.

It would be great to include a flag or some property in the response to indicate that the response came from the cache. This will help in future debugging.\n2.

Not sure what you plan to store in the cache, but consider the performance of serialization / deserizalation of objects in cache. Sometimes it might be better to store the raw serialized version from the server cache to avoid overhead. This is a perf optimization and can be prioritized for a later time.\n4.

Some Pinot clusters at Linkedin process several thousands of queries per second.\n\n• In case I need to add more users, what is the cost? (More hardware/servers/memory?)\n\nAdd more hardware, it scales near-linearly.\n\nFrom data point of view:\n• Is there a limitation on how many dimensions/lookup tables I can design? Is there any kind of performance implications?\n\nTables are independent, there's no real performance implication to adding tables (as long as you're not planning on having thousands of tables, at least, zk may be a contention point with that many tables). Judging from your question though, it seems as if you're doing a star schema-style design. Pinot doesn't support joins, so you should flatten your dimensions into the table itself.\n\n• What will be the cost of adding another dimension/lookup table? (More hardware/servers/memory or redesign of the solution?)\n\nSee above, no joins.\n\n• What about the history, as I mention before we are talking about one year retention, but if I need to add more retention time, example 3 years, what will be the implication?\n\nIt'll increase query latency if those rows need to be scanned as part of query execution. If they don't need to be, then they're nearly free (they get rejected quickly at query processing time).\n\nFrom Programming point of view:\n• Are the windows functions supported? \n\nNot at the moment. Windowing functions require a second pass during query execution and can be implemented on the client side.\n\n• If not, is there a workaround for it?\n\nCompute them on the client side.\n\n• If partially, which one is supported or not supported.\n• Are Joins between tables supported? (Is there a limitation for table size?)\n\nNo, and we don't foresee adding support for them this year.\n\n• Are nested queries supported?\n\nNo, and we don't foresee adding support for them this year.\n\n• Are functions like Count, sum, avg., max, min, etc. supported? How is it working with uniqueness? (Count (distinct X), Sum (distinct X), etc.)\n\nAggregate functions (count, sum, min, max, avg) are supported. You can do `select distinctCount(X)` for distinct count, `select distinctCountHLL(X)` for HyperLogLog approximation. \n\n• Are ranking functions, like in MSSQL, supported? (row_number, rank, dense_tank, ntile)\n\nNo, and we don't foresee adding support for them this year.\n\n• How Pinot is supporting the comparison between populations? Example, I need to get the population of users which didn’t purchase in the last 3 days but they click on my site at least 1 times. (when purchase and click are different events types in the system)\n\nPut both events in the same table as part of your ETL process, roll up the rows on Hadoop, `select sum(clickCount), sum(purchaseCount) where date >= 20160325 group by userId`\n\n• Flexibility from integration point of view (could it work with Java/python/etc.)\n\nWe have a Java API and a REST API for other languages.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/223365537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/223438705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/131#issuecomment-223438705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/131","id":223438705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQzODcwNQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T22:14:19Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T22:14:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n\nI

Some Pinot clusters at Linkedin process\n> several thousands of queries per second.\n> \n> • In case I need to add more users, what is the cost? (More\n> hardware/servers/memory?)\n> \n> Add more hardware, it scales near-linearly.\n> \n> From data point of view:\n> • Is there a limitation on how many dimensions/lookup tables I can design?\n> Is there any kind of performance implications?\n> \n> Tables are independent, there's no real performance implication to adding\n> tables (as long as you're not planning on having thousands of tables, at\n> least, zk may be a contention point with that many tables). Judging from\n> your question though, it seems as if you're doing a star schema-style\n> design. Pinot doesn't support joins, so you should flatten your dimensions\n> into the table itself.\n> \n> • What will be the cost of adding another dimension/lookup table? (More\n> hardware/servers/memory or redesign of the solution?)\n> \n> See above, no joins.\n> \n> • What about the history, as I mention before we are talking about one\n> year retention, but if I need to add more retention time, example 3 years,\n> what will be the implication?\n> \n> It'll increase query latency if those rows need to be scanned as part of\n> query execution. If they don't need to be, then they're nearly free (they\n> get rejected quickly at query processing time).\n> \n> From Programming point of view:\n> • Are the windows functions supported?\n> \n> Not at the moment. Windowing functions require a second pass during query\n> execution and can be implemented on the client side.\n> \n> • If not, is there a workaround for it?\n> \n> Compute them on the client side.\n> \n> • If partially, which one is supported or not supported.\n> • Are Joins between tables supported? (Is there a limitation for table\n> size?)\n> \n> No, and we don't foresee adding support for them this year.\n> \n> • Are nested queries supported?\n> \n> No, and we don't foresee adding support for them this year.\n> \n> • Are functions like Count, sum, avg., max, min, etc. supported? How is it\n> working with uniqueness? (Count (distinct X), Sum (distinct X), etc.)\n> \n> Aggregate functions (count, sum, min, max, avg) are supported. You can do select\n> distinctCount(X) for distinct count, select distinctCountHLL(X) for\n> HyperLogLog approximation.\n> \n> • Are ranking functions, like in MSSQL, supported? (row_number, rank,\n> dense_tank, ntile)\n> \n> No, and we don't foresee adding support for them this year.\n> \n> • How Pinot is supporting the comparison between populations? Example, I\n> need to get the population of users which didn’t purchase in the last 3\n> days but they click on my site at least 1 times.
