First initiative, so bare with me if my understanding is wrong about everything 😄. A question on the requirements:\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we should be able to filter out data during ingestion, so if we have a `pinotSchema.json` like\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"schemaName\": \"events\",\r\n  \"dimensionFieldSpecs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"userId\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"LONG\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({userID}, userID)”\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"fullName\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"STRING\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({firstName+' '+lastName}, firstName, lastName)”\r\n    },\r\n   {\r\n      \"name\": \"bids\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"INT\",\r\n      \"singleValueField\": false\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"maxBid\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"INT\",\r\n      \"transformFunction\": \"Groovy({bids.max{ it.toBigDecimal() }}, bids)\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"metricFieldSpecs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"impressions\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"LONG\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({eventType == 'IMPRESSION' ? 1: 0}, eventType)”\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"clicks\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"LONG\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({eventType == CLICK ? 1: 0}, eventType)”\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"cost\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"double\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"daysSinceEpoch\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"INT\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({timestamp/(1000*60*60*24)}, timestamp)”\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n   \"timeFieldSpec\": {\r\n    \"incomingGranularitySpec\": {\r\n      \"name\": \"hoursSinceEpoch\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"LONG\",\r\n      \"timeFormat\" : \"EPOCH\",\r\n      \"timeType\": \"HOURS\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({timestamp/(1000*60*60)}, timestamp)”\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwe would want to add a new top-level element in that json with a transformFunction  like\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"schemaName\": \"events\",\r\n  \"filter\": \"Groovy({cost > 42}, cost)\",\r\n  \"dimensionFieldSpecs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"userId\",\r\n      \"dataType\": \"LONG\",\r\n      “transformFunction”: “Groovy({userID}, userID)”\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n  ],\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen we would apply a row-based filter based on that transformFunction either\r\na) On source columns - applying the rest of the transformations AFTER filtering\r\nor\r\nb) On transformed columns - applying the filtering after the rest of the transformations.\r\n\r\nIs that all right?

- thanks for the feedback! Sorry for the delayed response - got pulled into a new project at work and was really heads down for the past few days. Let me know if there's any time expectations you'd like to set here - right now I'm scoping for the next couple of weeks (I'm more or less just working off-work hours) but if y'all need this done more quickly then let me know and I'll prioritize for it or bow out and let somebody else take it.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\nI'm thinking supporting two kinds of filtering might make the most sense: preFilter and postFilter. Pre-filtering is nice because it means, if the source row doesn't fit the filter, it can remove it without having to calculate any of the derived values. Post-filtering is nice because it allows means that any logic embedded in one of the columns doesn't have to be duplicated when calculating it for the filter (like in your example, you could just put the `maxBid` logic in a preFilter and then have that be a part of the conditional logic, but you're then duplicating that work for the actual column calculation). From an interface perspective, this also makes it slightly more sensible I think.\r\n\r\nIf we made it column-specific, that makes defining filters across columns awkward. Maybe we don't want to support them? There might be a performance improvement if we have a filter on a derived column - if that column's calculation completes early and is filtered out, it could skip the execution of other derived columns - but that seems like it might be optimizing for a very specific use case. We could also add this later if we think it'll be useful in the future.\r\n\r\nFor top-level filters being a column, someone _could_ just throw everything into a single `Groovy({column1 + column2 + ... + columnN > x}, column1, column2, ..., columnN)`. For multiple different conditions one could use `&&`. There might be a bit more clarity with having it be a list of multiple conditionals, but we might take a slight performance hit when executing the additional Groovy scripts.\r\n\r\nYeah, my vote is definitely for supporting expressions with multiple columns. But, I don't know the internals of the code really at all yet - do you think just focusing on a column-based approach would make more sense from an implementation perspective?\r\n\r\nRead through the doc - very nice! :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/618646220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/618723467","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/5268#issuecomment-618723467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5268","id":618723467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODcyMzQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"kishoreg","id":850791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg","html_url":"https://github.com/kishoreg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kishoreg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-23T23:33:05Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T23:33:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great discussion so far and valid points.

For example, segment roll-up config can be very simple - instead of having type, format, granularity, only granularity will be needed. \r\n\r\nAnother huge benefit will be an easier integration with external UIs such as Superset. I believe that Pinot-Superset connector have some extra logic to convert the time column values into a format that Superset understands. Since pinot's time column format/type will be different for each table, the external system now needs to know about Pinot's table configuration & schema (or similar time conversion config need to be specified for each table on Superset) for correctly parsing the time column value.\r\n\r\nSince we make the interface change to the time column, it would be great if we can discuss about this. \r\n\r\n@kishoreg @npawar @mayankshriv @Jackie-Jiang  How do you guys think? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/618751277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/619119431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/2756#issuecomment-619119431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/2756","id":619119431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTExOTQzMQ==","user":{"login":"npawar","id":19693933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjkzOTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19693933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar","html_url":"https://github.com/npawar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/npawar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T16:36:37Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T16:36:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree this would be nice to have, and see the benefits we gain for merge/rollup and integrations.\r\nI would prefer if we first get to making dateTimeFieldSpec the default, and then focus on this.

Based on the table config definitions here: https://docs.pinot.apache.org/pinot-components/table do you think it's worth adding a new top-level `filter` field? Or would it be better to nest it somewhere? Will there be future ingestion-related configs that we could all group under an `ingestConfig` or something?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, I hadn't thought about transient fields. Is there a way that we can infer transient fields so they don't have to be handled explicitly? Probably not, because we'd lose type information... I guess the other option would be to create a `transientFieldSpecs` list in the schema definition. These also could be used for other transform functions.\r\n\r\nBut now we're blowing scope quite a bit (though good for future work! 😄). In order to keep this small and achievable, what do y'all think I should start with @npawar @kishoreg ?\r\n1) Pre-filter/post-filter/both? I have a feeling pre-filter might be more in line with how transform functions work today, so maybe start there and we can add post-filtering in the future?\r\n2) Define in table config or schema definition? If defining in table config, what top-level field name should we have it under? If defined in the schema definition, should it be column-based or top-level? I think my preference here is for table config, but would love to hear @npawar 's thoughts on that\r\n3) Only handle added fieldSpecs for now? Or also handle transient fieldSpecs?

She added a number of the functions here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5324/files so I'm focusing mostly on LocalDateTime conversions here.\r\n\r\nThe interfaces should be something like:\r\n```\r\nDateTime toDateTime(String dateTimeString, String pattern)\r\n\r\nLong fromDateTime(DateTime localDateTime)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe core complexity here is in not creating a new SimpleDateFormat for each row (as Neha already mentioned). Right now, all DateTimeFunctions are static - if we were to write similar static functions we would either need to create a new SimpleDateFormat for each row (too slow) or create a simple cache for SimpleDateFormat (the joys of cache invalidation...). So, the better approach is to refactor the FunctionRegistry to allow non-static functions to be processed so we can have some shared memory between rows.\r\n\r\nI'm exploring the best way to go about this now, using the usage of TransformFunctions as an example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/623023872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/623039504","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5326#issuecomment-623039504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5326","id":623039504,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMzAzOTUwNA==","user":{"login":"reallocf","id":9631361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MzEzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9631361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf","html_url":"https://github.com/reallocf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reallocf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-03T01:32:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-03T01:32:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Question: how would y'all test something like this locally?
