infrastructure perspective.\r\n\r\n@Chris2011 you might want to have a look at this, as this picks up an idea you planted in my head. You suggested, that the node_modules folder should be added to the \"Ingnored Files Pattern\" and thus be excluded from the IDE via the `VisibilityQuery`. The issue with that is, that that is a sharp weapon. I tried it for a time, but noticed, that I had to look more often into the `node_modules` folder, than I thought. The difference between the `VisibilityQuery` and the `IndexabilityQuery` is, that the first completely hides the file from the IDE, while the latter is focused on the indexing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/933788738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/933829387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3209#issuecomment-933829387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3209","id":933829387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M43qRsL","user":{"login":"Chris2011","id":795658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/795658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-04T20:26:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T20:45:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@matthiasblaesing oh thats great, because of that functionality, that NetBeans hides the folders from the views, I created a plugin which brings back the files/folders as nodes to have a look into the node_modules as you already mentioned (https://github.com/Chris2011/ShowIgnoredFiles).\r\n\r\nSo that means, that your changes will skip the stuff from indexing, but folder will be still visible in the views, right?

introspection build actions in Gradle, has no opportunity to set the JAVA_HOME it will always use the Java version on which the IDE runs. Well the compatibility check still have to work on.\r\nGradle plans to support Java 17 in 7.3 officially. It shall be out in early October. Beside of this change we need to increase the bundled gradle-tooling library as well, whenever 7.3 comes out.\r\nSo let's wait for 7.3.

First of all, there is a chance that mvnd will merge with maven in the next major version of maven (so i heard). Also, if mvnw takes off, it will be just a flag and everything downloads behind the scene anyway - no need to bundle anything.\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue with mvnd being MT, which will cause build failures on some projects or plugin combinations. So it can't be made default. I tested it on some dusty projects and not all of them built reliably with mvnd.\r\n\r\nthe best strategy might be to wait a bit longer while supporting a little bit of everything.

You can find some cleanup PRs here which are a year old, have been approved, were never integrated and wouldn't apply cleanly anymore.
