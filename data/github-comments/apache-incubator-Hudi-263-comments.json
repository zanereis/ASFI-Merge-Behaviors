\r\nIf I understand correctly, @fengjian428 's suggestion is to go back to a previous snapshot if the latest one is corrupt. Hudi already supports time travel. However, @melin 's suggestion is to not even publish the snapshot if it is found to be corrupt.\r\n\r\nShouldn't savepoint/restore along with a staging area be sufficient to support this feature? It's about how to control the **visibility of a snapshot**. Hudi metadata can be first written to a staging area before being published. Audit tool runs ETL and validations with the staging metadata. If all is well, then the staging metadata changes are applied to production.\r\n\r\n@melin Hudi has all the necessary abstractions to support this feature. Can you please explain your use case and functional requirements in more detail? Are you also proposing abstractions for an audit tool? I think this could be useful to other users as well and worthy of RFC. \r\ncc @prasannarajaperumal @vinothchandar @nsivabalan @xushiyan ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1210421580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1210424912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6348#issuecomment-1210424912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6348","id":1210424912,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM5IJZ5Q","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-10T09:41:47Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T09:41:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This does not look related to HoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer class in any way.

> @danny0405 Few questions.\r\n> > \r\n> > * what table services could cause this?\r\n> > * Does this impact inserts too or only upserts?\r\n> > * The fix in this PR https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4812/files#r818514246 has greatly improved the write performance. This rollback would induce degradation. Can some parts of this rolled back code can be safely restored?\r\n> \r\n> 1. In our case, it's the clean service for COW table\r\n> 2. It is upserts\r\n> 3. We have made the refresh lazy in [[HUDI-4167] Remove the timeline refresh with initializing hoodie table #5716](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5716), thus the performance gap expects to be small now.\r\n\r\nDoes the lazy refresh also apply to the TimelineService [RequestHandler](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-timeline-service/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/timeline/service/RequestHandler.java)? One of the changes in the above mentioned [PR](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4812/files#r818514246) ensures that requests handled here does not refresh the local view if it is already ahead of the remote view. In your case did the Data loss happen because this refresh DID NOT happen? If not, removing this conditional check` HoodieTimeline.compareTimestamps(localLastKnownInstant, HoodieTimeline.LESSER_THAN, lastKnownInstantFromClient)` would force a refresh for a lot of requests.
