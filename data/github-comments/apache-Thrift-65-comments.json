The current docker file changes the user it runs under to use the same user id and group id as the host system has. This way the repository wont be polluted with files a non root user cannot delete.\r\nCan you try removing the files (autom4te.cache/) manually (probably requires root).

All the tests reported as broken in this PR are broken because they are broken in `master` (or were broken when I last rebased). If I'm mistaken, please tell me which tests break because of this.\r\n\r\nWe're using a Thrift version patched with this PR in production for over a year now, since it is otherwise impossible to build Thrift-generated code in C++20 mode, [as @bsergean confirmed](https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2755#issuecomment-1495967896).\r\n\r\nI will gladly rebase the changes one more time, but only if somebody actually takes a look at them then. Just spending the time of rebasing them every couple of months with zero effect seems kind of a waste.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1986017680/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/1986119496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2755#issuecomment-1986119496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2755","id":1986119496,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAS9U852YcdI","user":{"login":"Jens-G","id":5834733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G","html_url":"https://github.com/Jens-G","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jens-G/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-08T17:32:42Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:32:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You are right.
