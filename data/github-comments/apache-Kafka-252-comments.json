a key thing that seems to be missing seems to be that if no events arrive, the system timer will never trigger. So we have again the issue that in absence of events, `punctuate` is never called. I could be missing something. Is the way around this to call `maybePunctuate` in the `runLoop` method in `StreamThread.java` right before calling `maybeCommit`? That way we can check the time after each poll. cc @mjsax @guozhangwang on this as well. This, and associated tests around system time, seem to be key things missing IMO.

From the JIRA ticket it seems you are trying to solve relatively separate two issues:\r\n\r\n1) `zookeeper.connection` actually passing its value to `zookeeper.connection.timeout`, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n2) abbreviations are allowed in all the command tools because of `new OptionParser()`.\r\n\r\nYou has fixed 1) in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2322, while for 2) I'm not sure how much of a risk to allow abbreviations, and since it may change the behavior of all command tools (say if someone is using it with abbreviations in his operational tool-suite this change will suddenly break their code), could you elaborate a bit on the actual risk and better motivate this
