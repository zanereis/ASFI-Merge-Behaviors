Hi Anu, I don't quite understand your point. First, if the new tests need be named as BatchDMLTest.java, does it mean that the old TestBatch.java is for DDL test? But I don't see there's DDL test, batch operations are all just DML(insert/upsert/update).\nSecond, the code in TestBatch.java is really hard to read and maintain, lots of hardcode, test case granularity is too big (too many columns in one single table of one single test case, hard to debug), unclear test objective, nearly no comment. The main test objective I see in that code is just different data types. But Rowsets operation essentially is transaction, data type is not really the major focus. Honestly, I rather to remove this TestBatch.java, and re-write them all.\n\nSo I will just keep the new file name just like it is BatchTest.java now, rename it won't tell any difference, and later future I will replace the old TestBatch.java with more clear test cases.\n\nAnd sure thing, the ones in phoenix can be removed, I will do that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/168580196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/168775207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/227#issuecomment-168775207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/227","id":168775207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODc3NTIwNw==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-04T19:17:04Z","updated_at":"2016-01-04T19:17:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test
