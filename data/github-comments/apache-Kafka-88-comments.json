@enothereska I have a few meta questions while reviewing this PR:\n\nIn the same class, in `onAssignment`,  `partitionToTaskIds` is computed as:\n\n```\n            Iterator<TaskId> iter = info.activeTasks.iterator();\n            for (TopicPartition partition : partitions) {\n            Set<TaskId> taskIds = partitionToTaskIds.get(partition);\n            if (taskIds == null) {\n                taskIds = new HashSet<>();\n                partitionToTaskIds.put(partition, taskIds);\n            }\n\n            if (iter.hasNext()) {\n                taskIds.add(iter.next());\n            } else {\n                TaskAssignmentException ex = new TaskAssignmentException(\n                        \"failed to find a task id for the partition=\" + partition.toString() +\n

In addition, this field is only used in `StreamThread` for assigning partitions to the tasks to be created, which seems unnecessary.\n\nGenerally speaking, we need to know that when the thread is hosting multiple tasks and assigned with multiple partitions, which subset of partitions is assigned to each one of the hosting tasks. And in `AssignmentInfo`, the `standbyTasks` is a map from tasks to partitions, while the `activeTasks` is just a set of task ids. \n\nSo could we make `activeTasks` as a map as well (with bumped version and handling older versions) and cleanup the logic to compute `partitionToTaskIds` since it is not needed anymore.\n\nIn addition, there are some redundant variables in `StreamPartitionAssignor` and `AssignmentInfo` such as `standbyTasks` and `partitionsByHostState`. Could we just let the assignor to keep the assignmentInfo as its internal variable which gets updated in `onAssignment`. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244212378/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244234296","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1804#issuecomment-244234296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1804","id":244234296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDIzNDI5Ng==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-01T22:40:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T22:40:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I went through the whole assignment logic once again and I feel the logic has now becomes a bit lossy, and I want to clean them up probably in another PR but just dump my thoughts here on the appropriate logic (also cc @enothereska @mjsax):\n\nSome background:\n1. Each `KafkaStreams` instance contains a clientId, and if not specified default value is `applicationId-1/2/etc` if there are multiple instances inside the same JVM. One instance contains multiple threads where the thread-clientId is constructed as `clientId-StreamThread-1/2/etc`, and the thread-clientId is used as the embedded consumer clientId as well as metrics tag.\n2. However, since one instance can contain multiple threads, and hence multiple consumers, and when considering partition assignment, the streams library need to take the capacity into consideration based on the granularity of instance not on threads. Therefore we create a 4byte `UUID.randomUUID()` as the `processId` and encode that in the subscription metadata bytes, and the leader then knows if multiple consumer members are actually belong to the same instance (i.e. belong to threads of that instance), so that when assigning partitions it can balance among instances. `NOTE` that in production we recommend one thread per instance, so `consumersByClient` will only have one consumer per client (i.e. instance).\n3. In addition, historically we hard-code the `partition grouper` logic, where for each task, it is assigned only with one partition of its subscribed topic. For example, if we have `topicA` with `5` partitions and `topicB` with `10` partitions, we will create 10 tasks, with the first five tasks containing one of the partitions each, while the last five tasks contain only one partition from `topicB`. And therefore the `TaskId` class contains the `groupId` of the sub-topology and the `partition`, so that `taskId(group, 1)` gets `partition1` of `topicA` and `partition1` of `topicB`. We later expose this to users to customize so that more than one partitions of the topic can be assigned to the same task, so that the `partition` field in the `TaskId` no longer indicate anything about which partitions are assigned, and we add `AssignedPartitions` to capture which partitions are assigned to which tasks.\n4. While doing the assignment, the leader is also responsible for creating these changelog / repartition topics, and the number of partitions of these topics are equal to the number of tasks that needs to write to these topics, which are wrapped in `stateChangelogTopicToTaskIds` and `internalSourceTopicToTaskIds` respectively. After such topics are created, the leader also needs to \"augment\" the received cluster metadata with these topics to 1) check for copartitioning, and 2) maintained for QueryableState's discovery function.\n\nThe current implementation is mixed with all these legacy logic and gets quite messy, and I'm thinking to make a pass over the `StreamPartitionAssignor` and cleaning up it bit. More precisely:\n1. Read and parse the subscription information to construct the `clientMetadata` map, where each metadata contains the `Set<String> consumerMemberIds`, `ClientState<TaskId> state`, and `HostInfo hostInfo`.\n2. Access the (sub-)topology to create the corresponding changelog / repartition topics and construct the `stateChangelogTopicToTaskIds` and `internalSourceTopicToTaskIds`.\n3. Call `streamThread.partitionGrouper.partitionGroups` to get the map from created tasks to their assigned partitions.\n4. Call `TaskAssignor.assign` (which now takes the whole `clientMetadata` map) to assign tasks to clients, and hence we get the assigned partitions to clients.\n5. For each client, use some round-robin manner (as we did now) to assign tasks to their hosted consumers with the `clientMetadata.consumerMemberIds` map.\n6. Check co-partitioning of assigned partitions, and maintain the `Cluster` metadata locally on the leader.\n7. Construct the assignment info, where `activeTasks` is also a map from `TaskId` to list of `TopicPartitions` since otherwise we will not know which partitions are assigned to which tasks.\n8. For non-leaders, when getting the assignment, also construct the `Cluster` metadata from the decoded assignment information; and also maintain the `AssignmentInfo` locally for constructing the tasks.\n\nAnd some minor improvements:\n1. The default thread-clientIds `applicationId-x-StreamThread-y\" may still be conflicting to each other with multiple JVMs / machines, which is bad for metrics collection / debugging across hosts. We can modify the default clientId to`applicationId-processId`where`processId`is`UUID`, hence the default thread-clientId is`applicationId-UUID-StreamThread-y`.\n2. The `TaskId.partition` field no longer indicate which partitions are actually assigned to this task, but we still need to keep its `topicGroupId` field as it indicates which sub-topology this task belongs to, hence helpful for debugging. So maybe we can rename the `partition` field to sth. like `sequence`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244234296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244247754","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1809#issuecomment-244247754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1809","id":244247754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDI0Nzc1NA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-02T00:00:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T00:00:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @junrao \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244247754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244253772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1813#issuecomment-244253772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1813","id":244253772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDI1Mzc3Mg==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-02T00:43:00Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T00:43:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This means MirrorMaker could exit while the threads are still running...

Now that i've had the chance to think about it I have one potential solution for making this transparent to uses of the Processor API.\n\nWe can add another method `boolean isCachingEnabled()` to the new interface `ForwardingStateStoreSupplier`. We also add 2 new methods to `ProcessorNode`:\n`boolean isStateStoreCachingEnabled()` and `void setStateStoreCachingEnabled()`\n\nIn `TopologyBuilder` when we are creating the `ProcessorNodeCacheFlushListener` to attach to the `ForwardingStateStoreSupplier` we can call `ProcessorNode.setStateStoreCachingEnabled(supplier.isStateStoreCachingEnabled())`\n\nWe add an extra boolean parameter to the `ProcessorRecordContextImpl` `forward` this will be set to `false` when constructed from `StreamTask` and will be set to `true` when constructed from `ProcessorNodeCacheFlushListener`. Then in `ProcessorRecordContextImpl.forward(..)` we add a guard `if (shouldForward())` where `shouldForward` is `return forward || !node.stateStoreCachingEnabled();`\n\nNow `Processor`s are free to call `context().forward(..)` whether caching is enabled or not.

I had something like this in my mind during the call, too.\n\nHowever, thinking about the root cause of this issue again, I am not sure if the (overall) design of this KIP is optimal or not. My new concern is, that with this caching strategy, we \"merge\" two concepts into one; and I am not sure, if we should to this.\n\nCurrently, message flow and state is decoupled and independent of each other. Thus, if there is a state, updates to the state are completely independent from emitting output records. With the new design, we merge state updates and record emits, limiting the overall flexibility. I guess, from a DSL point of view, this would not be problematic, because in an aggregation and changelog output, each update to the state should result in a downstream record. However, from a Processor API point of view, there are other patterns we want to be able to support, too.\n\nBasically, for each input record, there a four different patterns that could be applied by the user:\n- no state updates, no output records\n- only state update\n- only output records\n- state updates and output records\n\nRight now, we go with a design that allows to use one of the patterns within a Processor. However, all 4 pattern could be mixed within a single Processor (pre KIP design), and this mixture would not be possible any more. If we want to support all four cases, we might not want to merge both into \"a single abstraction\" as we do in the design of this PR. What if a user just wants to sent a record downstream (without any state manipulation)?\n\nGoing back to the KIP design, we move the cache from RocksDB into the processor. However, what we actually wanted to do was to de-duplicate output records. Thus, the newly introduced cache, could actually go \"after the processor\" and could be completely independent from the state. Thus, on each call to `forward()` the record is put into the cache, and if the cache is full, an actual cache eviction and record forwarding happens. This would make the de-duplication cache independent from the state.\n\nFeedback is welcome. @dguy @enothereska  @guozhangwang @hjafarpour @miguno\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244574866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244575540","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1808#issuecomment-244575540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1808","id":244575540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDU3NTU0MA==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-03T23:29:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-03T23:29:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dguy @guozhangwang Updated.\nHowever, I do not understand the link you posted...

was reported on the dev list in an email in relation to Queryable State read guarantees. It was possible that on restore of a `StateStore`, i.e, on rebalance or app startup, that QS could start reading from the `StateStore` before it had been completely restored. There were 2 reasons this was possible:\n1.  a `RocksDBStore` was marked as open in  `openDB(..)` which is called before the state has been restored. This was because we don't call `init` on `RocksDBWindowStore.Segment`\n2. In `ProcessorStateManager` the store was added to the `stores` map before the state had been restored.\n\nUnfortunately i couldn't manage to write a reliable failing test for this as it is really down to timing of the calls and multiple threads.\n\nPlease have a look @enothereska @guozhangwang   \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244744908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244762451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1824#issuecomment-244762451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1824","id":244762451,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDc2MjQ1MQ==","user":{"login":"enothereska","id":14234336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14234336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska","html_url":"https://github.com/enothereska","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enothereska/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T14:42:10Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T14:42:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244762451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/244781639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1824#issuecomment-244781639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1824","id":244781639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDc4MTYzOQ==","user":{"login":"dguy","id":54829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy","html_url":"https://github.com/dguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-05T16:25:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T16:25:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is another issue here:\n In the case of multiple partitions and the tasks are being initialized it is always possible that 1 or more StateStores will be intialized before the complete set of stores in the Streams Instance are initialized.
