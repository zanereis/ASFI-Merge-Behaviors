What's its hardware env?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24643893/105124732-b7bd2800-5b15-11eb-9a2f-1b4be0aa2e1c.png)\r\n\r\n4. What's the MySQL server's hardware env?\r\n5. Please provide the configuration file of shardingjdbc.\r\n6. Please provide the SQLs of all the test cases.\r\n7. Can you prove the test cases do used PreparedStatement in the 2nd scenario? (show codes, etc..)\r\n8. How you calculate mulit-shop tps when the switch turned 'off'? I mean if shardingjdbc route to 3 shops for 1  logic SQL, we count 1. Meanwhile, when the swith turend off, 3 actual SQLs to 3 shop count as 1 or 3?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763314967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763317167","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8942#issuecomment-763317167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/8942","id":763317167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MzMxNzE2Nw==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-20T04:11:39Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T04:11:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@danielzhou888 \r\nBeside, I don't think the 1st conclusion meet expectation.

Preparation work helps us move it forward smoothly. The target definitions of `COMDEV-385` are `SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT`. From my perspective, `SELECT` is the most difficult one. My suggestion is first to try `INSERT` or `DELETE`. \r\n\r\nAny questions, please be free to ping me or @wgy8283335  at your PR.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is that I am not sure whether `GSOC2021` allows pre-raise PRs. If not, we need to figure out how to do our preparation work.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763321773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763322620","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/9097#issuecomment-763322620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9097","id":763322620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MzMyMjYyMA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-20T04:29:49Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T04:29:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Nice check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763322620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763332998","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9043#issuecomment-763332998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9043","id":763332998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MzMzMjk5OA==","user":{"login":"tristaZero","id":27757146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzU3MTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27757146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero","html_url":"https://github.com/tristaZero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tristaZero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-20T05:00:33Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T05:00:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, \r\nWhat's the SQL running? `UNION` is unsupported presently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/763332998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
