The scheduling delay is generated by a monitoring task that is running on the cluster with 5m interval. It will compare the current timestamp against the expected scheduling timestamp(execution_date + 5m) and send the time diff in min as one data point on the metric graph, e.g. monitoring task with execution_date 2018-01-01T00:00:00 started at 2018-01-01T00:06:00 will put a 1m scheduling delay data point onto the metric graph.(I'll update the description too)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/418567335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/418600096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3602#issuecomment-418600096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3602","id":418600096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODYwMDA5Ng==","user":{"login":"jeffkpayne","id":43057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffkpayne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkpayne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T05:01:25Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T05:01:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ashb Btw, you referenced AIRFLOW-2797 in the PR, but I think that was a typo, as that has to do with using a custom Dataproc image when creating clusters...
