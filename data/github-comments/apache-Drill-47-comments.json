@amansinha100 . Thanks for your active involvement, I investigated the issue and found that:\r\n\r\nwhen option `planner.slice_target` is set to low value, then StreamAggPrule at the first match will try to create 2 phase plan, but method call.transformTo(newRel) won't be called (means that rule results are ignored), because the rule matches at the very early stage of physical planning, there aren't rels matched by new traitSet with physical convention. Currently for simple cross join query with aggregate function, physical rules are applied in order, which is wrong and results into PlanningException:\r\n\r\nPrel.ScreenPrule\r\nPrel.ScreenPrule\r\nPrel.ScanPrule\r\nPrel.ScanPrule\r\nProjectPrule\r\nProjectPrule\r\nPrel.NestedLoopJoinPrule\r\nExpandConversionRule\r\nExpandConversionRule ....\r\n\r\nThe problem may be fixed either by returning false from StreamAggPrule.create2PhasePlan(call, aggregate) for cross join queries, so then StreamAggPrule will be applied successfully at early stage. Or another option is to change NestedLoopJoinPrule left and join node's distribution trait from ANY to SINGLETON, which then results in activation of ProjectPrule -> StreamAggPrule etc. So then StreamAggPrule is activated again, but now at the right stage when it can be applied successfully.\r\n\r\n@vvysotskyi  suggests to proceed with second option, but in order to do this I need to investigate more about how changing of the distribution traits for NestedLoopJoinPrule left and join node impacts physical planning. And then, if possible, try to activate necessary rules without distribution trait change.\r\n\r\n@amansinha100 I'd appreciate if you could share your thoughts about the options.

So there could be an initial state where a physical rule did not match but subsequently after other transformations, it could match and be triggered.  I would suggest enabling Calcite tracing to get a better idea of what's going on with the distribution traits of the NestedLoopJoin that is causing the downstream StreamingAgg to not get planned with multi-phase aggregation.

First re: breaking backward compatibility.  Since the RESTful interface returns JSON KV pairs, and since all this is doing is introducing an additional key (metadata) which contains the column types, I don't think it will break anything since it isn't doing anything to the existing keys.  No real way to know unless a lot of people complain, but the tools which I use that use the RESTful interface are not affected.\r\n\r\nSecondly, regarding star queries, I did try a few on my local machine and you get a dump of all the column types. IE if your data contains 4 columns and you do a `SELECT *` you get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"metadata\": [\r\n    \"INT\",\r\n    \"VARCHAR\",\r\n    \"VARCHAR\",\r\n    \"VARCHAR\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nSince this code gets called when results are returned, I don't think schema inconsistencies matter.  IE if the query fails due to schema inconsistencies, you won't get metadata, and if it succeeds you get the results. \r\n\r\n@arina-ielchiieva Would you like to see additional arrays with precision and scale with null values if it is not needed.  IE \r\n```\r\n\"scale\": [\r\n4,\r\nnull,\r\nnull,\r\nnull\r\n]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/439064781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/439074157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1539#issuecomment-439074157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1539","id":439074157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTA3NDE1Nw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T15:13:10Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T15:13:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cgivre you mean inside of metadata?\r\n```\r\n  \"metadata\": [\r\n    type: [\r\n       \"DECIMAL\"\r\n     ],\r\n    precision: [\r\n       5\r\n    ],\r\n   scale: [\r\n     2\r\n   ]\r\n ]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/439074157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/439080815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1539#issuecomment-439080815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1539","id":439080815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTA4MDgxNQ==","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-15T15:31:33Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T15:31:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva \r\nI like that.
