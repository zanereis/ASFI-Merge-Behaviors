- Allow submitting multiple jars from the client</p>\n\n<p>    The PR is not complete yet and needs some refinements. I wanted to get some feedback first. I tried out multiple approaches -<br/>\n    1. Submitting individual jar one by one - Right now the stormjar has a hardcoded key so that both supervisor and nimbus can download/upload the jar. This becomes complicated if there is more than one jar. The keys for all the jars have to be passed from nimbus to supervisor. Then these keys have to be updated, removed, waited--upon-for-code-replication etc. <br/>\n    2. Build an app-assembly jar programmatically - It is not desired as it changes the internal structure of jar. which can result in unknown issues e.g. manifests have to be handled correctly. <br/>\n    3. Packing jars into a zip, upload it and unzip it and supervisor - This is the current approach. It seemed to me the cleanest approach. </p>\n\n<p>    I can also add an option to turn zip/unzip off for single jar topologies. </p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by
