thanks for the review. I understand your concern about changes that are not strictly necessary being part of this PR. However, as you know this is not really a standalone change but part of an originally larger diff that aims to enable SplittableDoFn. It was discussed later to submit these changes separately and I already spent a good amount of time removing all the other splittable specific pieces. I think before spending even more time extracting the as you rightly point out unused code, I would rather return to the original plan and submit an even larger PR for the entire splittable feature. @kennknowles would like to have your opinion on that as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/292283680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/292288183","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2452#issuecomment-292288183","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2452","id":292288183,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjI4ODE4Mw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T19:31:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T19:31:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/9247/<h2>Build result: FAILURE</span></h2>[...truncated 2.50 MB...]\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)Caused by: org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: Command execution failed.\tat org.codehaus.mojo.exec.ExecMojo.execute(ExecMojo.java:302)\tat org.apache.maven.plugin.DefaultBuildPluginManager.executeMojo(DefaultBuildPluginManager.java:134)\tat org.apache.maven.lifecycle.internal.MojoExecutor.execute(MojoExecutor.java:208)\t... 31 moreCaused by: org.apache.commons.exec.ExecuteException: Process exited with an error: 1 (Exit value: 1)\tat org.apache.commons.exec.DefaultExecutor.executeInternal(DefaultExecutor.java:404)\tat org.apache.commons.exec.DefaultExecutor.execute(DefaultExecutor.java:166)\tat org.codehaus.mojo.exec.ExecMojo.executeCommandLine(ExecMojo.java:764)\tat org.codehaus.mojo.exec.ExecMojo.executeCommandLine(ExecMojo.java:711)\tat org.codehaus.mojo.exec.ExecMojo.execute(ExecMojo.java:289)\t... 33 more2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] 2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] 2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] 2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command2017-04-06T19:27:10.574 [ERROR]   mvn <goals> -rf :beam-sdks-pythonchannel stoppedSetting status of 2acdb1c63cc3c344187d5df150e027a0d5989e23 to FAILURE with url https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/9247/ and message: 'Build finished.

am a bit conflicted here, because on one hand I'm very happy with progress on SDF and on removing the ugly remnants of OldDoFn, but on the other hand I'm not comfortable LGTMing code that I do not fully understand; plus there's concerns that Kenn expressed about clean rollbacks/cherrypicks, and general hygiene of file history.\r\n\r\nFor me, progress on the features in this case is sufficiently important that I also won't block on some of these concerns, but there are a few things that I think are simple enough to address, and would greatly improve the state of this PR, so I would prefer to see them addressed:\r\n\r\n- As Kenn says, some of the large chunks of code here here seem easy to remove from the PR using git add -p. That would significantly reduce the size of this PR and make it easier to review.\r\n- I'd really appreciate if you edited the PR description to explain the major changes you did here, and why. That also would make it easier to review for me (I would be able to review it much faster and with much higher quality); and I found that when I do this myself, I often find that there are things I missed, so it's good for code quality too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/292308195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/292308667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2413#issuecomment-292308667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2413","id":292308667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjMwODY2Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T20:32:14Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T20:32:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/9252/\n--none--","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/292308667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/292309181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2405#issuecomment-292309181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2405","id":292309181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjMwOTE4MQ==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T20:33:34Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T20:33:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm fine with the current phrasing, though I'd replace \"may\" with \"should\".

catch @sb2nov. It was clearly a mistake from my side not testing BEAM-778 on Windows.\r\nYour fix looks reasonable to me from the content perspective (I don't have windows machine around to test it).\r\n\r\nTwo thoughts:\r\n * Is it possible to setup Windows Jenkins Slave/Travis for testing?\r\n * Currently the tests are using `with open('filename', mode)`. This could be further simplified to `with CompressedFile(open(..),..)`. That way we would also test the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of
