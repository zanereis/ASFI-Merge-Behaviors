store's image will not contain any unexpected records, i.e.: any record that will show up in the restored lru will definitely be in the original lru, even with `delete` operations supported in the lru store. I'd omit the proof here but we can chat offline if you are interested.\r\n\r\nWith that, I think we then do not need to log the evicted records anymore from the changelog topic, and it is safe to just remove this piece of logic here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/296906036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/296906123","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2907#issuecomment-296906123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2907","id":296906123,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjkwNjEyMw==","user":{"login":"huxihx","id":11549429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ5NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11549429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx","html_url":"https://github.com/huxihx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huxihx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-25T04:54:41Z","updated_at":"2017-04-25T04:54:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@junrao Please kindly review the PR.
