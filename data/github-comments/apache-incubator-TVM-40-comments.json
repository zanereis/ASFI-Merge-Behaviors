For graph level layout planning, current DP solution is nice. For operator level tuning, we can reuse measurement/tuner infrastructure in autotvm.\r\n\r\nIt seems that we developed our custom tuner systems at a same time, and there are a lot of things to do for the merge. But keeping an unified infrastructure ensures the maintainability.\r\nI can give some guidance on porting the executor to autotvm style.\r\n\r\n## Abstractions in AutoTVM\r\n* Task: Task stores all information for tuning an operator: target, target_host, space and workload. This corresponds to one entry of your `Conv2dAVXExecutor.workload_execute` \r\n* ConfigEntity: It contains all parameters for a template, which is the \"schedule\" tuple in your code.\r\n* Workload: It is same as \"workload\" in your code. One difference is that autotvm uses vanilla tuple instead of namedtuple. By default, autotvm automatically translates all arguments of TOPI call to a tuple as workload. But for custom layouts, you have to construct the workload by yourself. You can find some examples in arm cpu https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/54a115ef14fb6dabbf6ea8eb9e6dd85846030c72/topi/python/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d.py#L15\r\n* MeasureInput, MeasureResult: It stores all information of one measurement (workload, schedule, time cost). This corresponds to `[{\"schedule\": AVXConvCommonFwd(1, 4, 2, True), \"time\": 0.04}],` in your code. AutoTVM can serialize them to json and use them as the log file (see tvm/autotvm/record.py).\r\n* DispatchContext: This corresponds to `_get_schedule_conv` in current x86 topi. In AutoTVM, `topi.nn.conv2d` and `topi.generic.schedule_conv2d` will construct a workload and use this workload to query corresponding ConfigEntity from the dispatch context.\r\n\r\nPreviously, schedule function `topi.generic.schedule_conv2d` need to reconstruct the workload from dataflow by using `_get_workload`. Now, in compute function `topi.nn.conv2d`, we can attach a tuple to the compute op https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/54a115ef14fb6dabbf6ea8eb9e6dd85846030c72/topi/python/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d.py#L148. Then in schedule function, we just fetch the workload by `op.attrs['workload']`\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n* port operator `topi/x86` into autotvm style. \r\n    * use `cfg.define_split`, `cfg.define_knob` to define your space\r\n    * For alter_op_layout, it is more complicated. you can find some examples in arm cpu https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/54a115ef14fb6dabbf6ea8eb9e6dd85846030c72/topi/python/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d.py#L476. \r\n* port graph tuner\r\n   - As you pointed out, we need a plain benchmark mode. For operators, you can use `GridSearchTuner` for exhaustive search. For layout, you can reuse https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/54a115ef14fb6dabbf6ea8eb9e6dd85846030c72/python/tvm/autotvm/measure/measure_methods.py#L179 for measurement. You can create a LayoutTuner, and feed in customized MeasureInput.\r\n  - After the above steps, all the input to DP should be in (MeasureInput, MeasureResult) pairs. Then you have all the required measurement result for DP.\r\n  - Schedule load method. Current way that uses a global index looks like a hack. You can create a custom DispatchContext for this kind of schedule(ConfigEntity) load.\r\n\r\n## Discussions\r\n* Currently autotvm stores parameters in another git repo https://github.com/uwsaml/tvm-distro. When we create target (e.g. `tvm.target.avx()`), tvm will download them.

any other format if we could have them defined.\r\n- SparsePlaceholderOp class have been created and inherited.\r\n- conflict with upstream have been fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure whether it's okay to have duplicated entries in CSR, like what have been implemented in scipy.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @yzhliu @tqchen I think most of the concerns have been covered by now.

Debugging/profiling is important and we want to get things right:) \r\n\r\n- After #1610, we should be able to directly support get_ndarray from the debugger, this might involves refactor the graph runtime a bit to directly use ndarray, this removes the need of adoc set_debug_tensor(Note that it is not safe to pass DLTensor(should use NDArray instead)) to retain ownership. cc @srkreddy1238 \r\n- Use chrono to do the timing, see https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/runtime/rpc/rpc_session.cc#L1200\r\n   - Always synchronize after each step run, to get the time measurement right(note that we need to sync to get GPUs).\r\n-  Let us remove most of the Ux objects, for now, create a simple demo to run the debugger and print out the per layer timing.\r\n   - Try to minimize API change over graph runtime.\r\n   - This seems to be the feature most people want\r\n- After reading the things, I feel we do not necessarily need to serialize the graph and ndarray and can just provide

\r\n\r\nOne situation while designing function callbacks for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe function closure is defined as ```func (args ...interface{}) (*Value, error)``` which takes golang types as variadic args and packs them as TVMValue array internally. The return value is TVMValue and AsXXX wrappers are provided to access the underlying values.\r\n\r\nI am looking at function callbacks definition as ```func (args ...interface{}) (interface{})``` which takes variadic args and returns an interface.\r\n\r\nThe signature should be same for both cases.\r\n\r\nReason behind proposing ```interface{}``` instead of ```TVMValue``` is user don't' need to explicitly embed  golang types into ```TVMValue``` with wrappers.\r\n\r\nSamples:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n    // Call function\r\n    graphrt, err := funp(jsonStr, modp, (int64)(gotvm.KDLCPU),

Please have a look again, I updated the code based on your comment.\r\n\r\n> After #1610, we should be able to directly support get_ndarray from the debugger, this might involves refactor the graph runtime a bit to directly use ndarray, this removes the need of adoc set_debug_tensor(Note that it is not safe to pass DLTensor(should use NDArray instead)) to retain ownership. cc \r\n\r\nI couldn't find any function in ndarray.cc which will make NDArray from DLTensor, so I updated ndarray.cc  to added a method for this.\r\nset_debug_tensor is completely removed and NDArray is used.\r\n\r\n> Use chrono to do the timing, see https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/runtime/rpc/rpc_session.cc#L1200\r\n\r\nUpdated with chrono for timing\r\n\r\n> Always synchronize after each step run, to get the time measurement right(note that we need to sync to get GPUs).\r\n\r\nSyncing is taken care\r\n\r\n> Let us remove most of the Ux objects, for now, create a simple demo to run the debugger and print out the per layer timing.\r\n\r\nUx objects are removed, some interfaces, its kept as argument(dbg_ux): . This debugger was written for supporting ncurses ui and tensorboard, so the ux objects were there. Now this does the dumping of nodes, and display. \r\nNow it will show some simple display about the time consumed for each layer, to visualize the relation of each node and tensor values, still we need to use curses/tensorboard.\r\nThe current output format is below.\r\n```\r\nNode Name        Ops                                Time(us)             Shape               Inputs       Outputs
