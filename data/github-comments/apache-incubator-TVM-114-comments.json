Then i check the `inputs->dom_scale`, which used by `Concatenate` op. to find the `lhs_expr->dom_scale=0`, and the `rhs_expr->dom_scale` is normal. So i go back to check all `dom_scale of quantize_op` in calibration stage. But all `act scale` >0, such as `[4], [8]`. i don't know why the `dom scale of quantize op` can be changed. hope you give some clues. Thanks.\r\n\r\nFeedback \r\nHi @eqy @vinx13 , I found that `upsampling` is ahead of `concat` op. And `upsampling` haven't defined in `annotate` and `realize`. my model can work normally  when i add `identity_rewrite` for `upsampling` in `annotate` and `realize` pass. But i don't know why my model can run on `master tvm`  in `quantize int8` mode, even though it haven't support `usampling` quantization. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512778654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512887484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3094#issuecomment-512887484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3094","id":512887484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjg4NzQ4NA==","user":{"login":"yongwww","id":10205827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjA1ODI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10205827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww","html_url":"https://github.com/yongwww","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongwww/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T16:22:24Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T16:22:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tqchen updated.

This can be in shared memory  for the Zynq FPGAs with cma_alloc(), or explicitly managed in the FPGA board DIMMs on F1.\r\n- `VTAMemFree` deallocates the buffer.\r\n- `VTAMemMoveToBuffer` handles transfers from host DRAM to the FPGA-readable/writeable buffer. On SoC devices, it's a simple memcpy preceded by a cache flush if the accelerator has non-coherent access. On PCI-E based devices, the transfer would be initiated as a DMA.\r\n- `VTAMemMoveFromBuffer` analogous to previous function, but the other way around.\r\n\r\nWe now hide the flush and invalidate API since that is specific to shared memory devices and can be handles as part of the other API calls: `VTAMemMoveToBuffer` and `VTAMemMoveFromBuffer`.\r\n\r\nRuntime was refactored slightly to reflect this change. Now instead of populating the FPGA readable instruction and micro op buffers, we perform a memory copy right before we synchronize with VTA; this comes at a very slight performance cost. On the Pynq, this amounted to about 1% performance degradation on e2e ResNet18 inference. If this becomes more significant, we can split the runtime into an SoC optimized runtime, but at this stage, keeping it unified will make maintenance more straightforward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512962504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/512966091","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/3554#issuecomment-512966091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3554","id":512966091,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjk2NjA5MQ==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T20:02:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T20:02:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen @vegaluisjose can I get a review?

The broadest reach lowest friction to potential users is at the C end of the scale.  Aside from the language subset used, other issues are availability (and size!) of the std c++ library on a platform. The memory management strategy used (at the small end, memory fragmentation kills you, hence arbitrary use of the heap is undesirable).   By way of example, last time I checked on zephyr rtos their C++ application support capability was broadly:  no use of new / delete, no rtti, no exceptions, no static global object destruction.... (not that new/delete ban has a significant impact on the std c++ library available!) Other RTOS environments are richer, others are more constrained.\r\n\r\nThere is a limited cost to the tvm community to provide a 'C' runtime rather than a C++ runtime, but doing so broadens tvm's reach.\r\n\r\nBTW....

Of course TVM is even more than just optimizing, it holds IR language for compiling/doing such and lots of cool other stuff.\r\n\r\n * I try propose here a replacement for some hardcoded winograd matrices (the classical tile_size 2 & 4 for conv2d case) but also leave room for any size up to 8. \r\n\r\n * In practice TVM's autotuning (mostly based on xgboost over collected compute statistics) will find tile size of 2, 3, 4 or rare case even 6 (conducted lots of test on opencl/mali-gpu in winograd scenario), haven't seen to pick up higher values.\r\n\r\n * I know it may sound absurd > 6 but that's the cool part of TVM it will find the proper way to do it (this is the goal to find it auto-magically).\r\n\r\n * As far i know TVM project is unique among libraries it can \"autotune\" and try find best computational approach for a specific operator over a specific hardware target, it quite does well even if combinatoric space covers millions of possibilities (folks here can tell lot more about)\r\n\r\n  Most interesting part would be targeting int8 or other quantization variants, so  i think by having the matrix generator (maybe some post \"precision tuner\") would be good allies for winograd class schedules in TVM fashion of doing it.\r\n\r\n  I would remind you all of some more exotic approach that even uses complex numbers as interpolation points [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01965).

@huajsj \r\n\r\nThanks for the contrib, here is my take on this.\r\n\r\nMulti-threading support for functional simulator will only provide simulation-performance benefit or simulation time will be short.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want to use this infrastructure to have an idea how thread-level-parallelism would work then you got it wrong. The reason is that you are still assuming that Load, Compute and Store are executing on an infinite-clock-speed (functional simulator) but in reality each block/instructions will have different timing based on many factors. Therefore, having multiple threads executing at the same time but finishing early (infinite-clock-speed) won't help much in terms of analysis.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513092238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/513094763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/3544#issuecomment-513094763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3544","id":513094763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzA5NDc2Mw==","user":{"login":"zacario-li","id":20140521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQwNTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20140521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li","html_url":"https://github.com/zacario-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacario-li/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-19T05:23:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T05:23:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I second this, maybe you can provide us insights in the docs on how to develop operators for the ONNX and other frontends?\r\n> I'm encountering difficulties with inputs, attr, the calls to _op.X and AttrCvt, etc. while trying to implement ConstantOfShape, LSTM, and Tile.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks ! @zhiics\r\n\r\nSame situation with you.

A big +1 for doing a joined up performance nightly testing on what we care about and figuring out ways of doing this.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative to visualizing performance and something I've used in the teams I've worked in on  other projects has been lnt. 2 interesting links below for performance monitoring. LNT is also interesting from the point of view that it manages to collect perf profiles, https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/profiles.html and can help visualize differences in performance from the perf profiles in terms of real assembler. I've found this pretty useful in terms of productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. http://lnt.llvm.org/ - monitoring llvm performance. \r\n2. https://lnt.opensuse.org/ - monitoring GCC performance over time.\r\n\r\nTBH, the rust web interface looks good - what would be good to check is \r\na. what are the dependencies on the target side ? \r\nb.
