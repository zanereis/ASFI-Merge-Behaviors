It uses two icons to identify, in this case, the current theme. There was also the option for the button to display the icon of the theme that would be applied upon clicking. Personally, I don't think there's any difference between the two approaches; both are used. The React website (https://react.dev/) uses the second option described, while the site of Docusaurus, for example, uses the one I implemented (https://docusaurus.io/).\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, also regarding the position.

So, about positioning, I meant to put both controls to the right of the search bar because as you noticed, things start to feel more odd when they are \"sandwiched\" together. It is a mix of UI controls and actual functionality. Notably, the \"upload trace\" which is an alternative to choosing one, is between UI controls now.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-06 at 07 33 35](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/assets/64215/9e74f0a0-269f-4a56-a39b-bed23a0f1704)\r\n\r\nI do like the icon.. you chose.\r\n\r\nFor ISO 639-1, I think let's limit it simply to shortening to keep your work down especially as I'm not likely to do a lot of PR review when on vacation. So, use the 2 letter code instead of long form. You can do that in a PR to merge before this one, then rebase this, or you can do it here. In any case, I think merging this without that done adds weight to the top bar, especially for folks like me who use low resolution due to \"old man eyes\" ;)\r\n\r\nHere, I think the main change is to move both UI controls and to the right of the vertical line. When we release this code, we can ask for feedback. As you notice, no one else is giving feedback, so we have to do our best then let community tell us if they didn't like it.\r\n\r\nOn the glitches in translations, I'm not entirely surprised. If you want to do a PR to fix some of the gaps, please do.\r\n\r\nCheers!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2040768655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/2051170521","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3755#issuecomment-2051170521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/3755","id":2051170521,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEXUMc56QmDZ","user":{"login":"giaroc","id":23033509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDMzNTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23033509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc","html_url":"https://github.com/giaroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giaroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-12T07:24:02Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T07:24:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry for writing only now.
