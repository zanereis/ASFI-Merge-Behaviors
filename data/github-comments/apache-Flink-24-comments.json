Directed won today!\n\nNext, I see why you wanted reduceOnEdges, I used it, but there's a small glitch there(in EmitOneEdgePerNode) that the test doesn't catch. I solved the problem in a not-so-elegant way for now, because I think that solving the problem should be a separate JIRA issue(it has nothing to do with Jaccard). \n\nSo my suggestion is: we merge the code with the if statement; I open a bug, fix reduceOnEdges to work for this usecase as well and then everything will look nice and clean. \nWhat do you think? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/87830769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/87840336","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/542#issuecomment-87840336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/542","id":87840336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODQwMzM2","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-30T21:41:47Z","updated_at":"2015-03-30T21:41:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I know that the PR is touching many components. I'll try to split up my work into smaller parts.\nIn this case I didn't expect in the beginning that I need to change so many things.\n\nThe PR is mainly about adding support for executing a Flink job on YARN in a \"fire and forget\" fashion.\nTherefore, I needed to make some changes to the YARN client. \nIn the previous big change to YARN, I added support for a \"detached\" yarn session. So that you can tell the Flink Yarn Client to start Flink on YARN without connecting to the AM afterwards. Users have to manage such a yarn session using other tools afterwards (for example `yarn application -kill` to stop it)\n\nThis change brings this feature even further to support single flink jobs being submitted to YARN. But since the Yarn client doesn't connect to the AM once Flink has been started, there is no way to tell the AM to stop Flink on YARN again.\nIn this change, I add a new Akka message for the ApplicationMaster `case class StopAMAfterJob(jobId:JobID)`. The message tells the AM to monitor the JM until the job has finished. Once that has happened, the AM stops Flink on YARN.\nTo get this `JobID` I needed to make some changes to the CliFrontend / Client. The Client has two ways of submitting a Job to Flink: an attached mode (default) and a detached mode.\nThe attached mode is returning the `JobExecutionResult`, the detached mode was returning nothing. I created a new type called `JobSubmissionResult` which is returned by the detached job submission. It only contains the job id. The JobExecutionResult is extending the JobSubmissionResult.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/87840336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/87879789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/546#issuecomment-87879789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/546","id":87879789,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODc5Nzg5","user":{"login":"hsaputra","id":105434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra","html_url":"https://github.com/hsaputra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hsaputra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-30T23:56:25Z","updated_at":"2015-03-30T23:56:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM\n\nOnce Travis done will merge unless more review coming in.

@tillrohrmann! Thanks for the heads up :)\nThe failing test is `DegreesWithExceptionITCase` and it seems that it fails because of not throwing the excepted exception type. We had a discussion about this in #475 and if I get it correctly, we can't be sure which exception will be reported to the client, because of the job cancelling. Thus, we removed the check of the exception type and message and only checked for failure.\nHowever, I see you added some exception checks in 36b762e. So, I'm not sure what we're supposed to do with this test now, so that it doesn't fail o.O\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/88834217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/88836418","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/545#issuecomment-88836418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/545","id":88836418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4ODM2NDE4","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-02T09:08:31Z","updated_at":"2015-04-02T09:08:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh ok, I was not aware of #475.

I think it makes it harder to review your changes. We haven't really written this down somewhere (this is actually a good reminder that we need to do this), but you should keep it in mind.\n- I only had a quick look at the hack you pointed out. I think we should _not_ merge it in the current state (in any case I would vote to postpone merging this until _after_ the upcoming milestone release). Can you provide more information about what kind of Exception is thrown?

I agree that the code in `GatherNeighbors` might be confusing. In my opinion, we could do the following to simplify it a bit:\n- get rid of the Iterator and just iterate on the Iterable using a `for (Tuple2... vertexWithEdge : neighbors) {}` construct.\n- replace the if block that compares the vertex IDs to find the neighbor with a method `getNeighborID()`, which will extract the correct ID from the Edge. I think this will make the logic of the example clearer.\n  What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90201652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90209580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/573#issuecomment-90209580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/573","id":90209580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwMjA5NTgw","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-06T19:36:34Z","updated_at":"2015-04-06T19:36:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I fixed the rebase problem to remove the unnecessary commits.

Thanks a lot for your work on this :)\n\nI only took a quick look at your changes for now, but it seems that all issues are fixed.\nThis PR introduces a lot of changes, so I would like to look into it more carefully. Also, it'd be great if one more person could review.\n\nNext, I think we should add a few tests to make sure we don't break existing functionality and that the newly introduced options work as expected.\n\nMore specifically, I would test the following:\n- if no direction is given, the iteration works as before, i.e. collecting messages from in-neighbors and sending messages to out-neighbors .\n- if direction is set to IN / OUT / ALL\n- if the degrees option is not set, the vertex cannot access the degree, i.e. no method is available or an error is produced\n- if the degrees option is set, the degrees can be accessed in all supersteps and their values are correct\n- combination of the above, e.g. set direction to ALL and degrees.\n\nI guess adding those tests will be easier after we merge #547 and make the new options part of the configuration.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90233701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/90245431","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/573#issuecomment-90245431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/573","id":90245431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwMjQ1NDMx","user":{"login":"mbalassi","id":5990983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTA5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5990983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi","html_url":"https://github.com/mbalassi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbalassi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-06T21:10:27Z","updated_at":"2015-04-06T21:10:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks,

Not sure that their availability can be changed by setting the option on the iteration. They are not computed when the degree option is not set, but you can still see the method.

Basically, you'll just have to rename what you have already implemented. The reduceOn\\* methods will only return one value per vertex, like they do currently, but internally use the reduce operator (instead of reduceGroup).\n\nFor example, if you want to compute the sum of edge values, you can use the `reduceOnEdges` method, same as you currently do. And if you want to compute the Jaccard coefficient, you need to output multiple values per vertex and for that you can use `groupReduceOnEdges`.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!
