Or, it can be another test invocation in the same module that overrides the version for the second invocation. (Other options available too.)

When the `TestPipeline` is used in the scope of a test, it checks the `beamTestPipelineOptions` to determine the pipeline options, among which is the runner class, so each runner module can set its own test settings using the `beamTestPipelineOptions`. \r\nIf `beamTestPipelineOptions` is not set, the `beamUseDummyRunner` system property is inspected, and if set, a special type of runner is set - the `CrashingRunner`, which throws an `IllegalArgumentException` exception upon an attempt to execute the pipeline. `CrashingRunner` is suitable for tests that test pipeline construction only, and do not actually run the pipeline they construct.\r\n\r\n_Do tests outside `beam-sdks-java-core` / `beam-runners-core-java` need to be decorated with `@NeedsRunner`/`@RunnableOnService`_?\r\n\r\n`DirectRunner` does NOT search for tests annotated with `@NeedsRunner` outside the `beam-sdks-java-core` and `beam-runners-core-java` modules. So even if they are annotated with `@NeedsRunner` they will NOT be executed as part of the `DirectRunner`s build cycle. \r\nHowever, modules that wish to run their tests using the `DirectRunner` can set a test scope dependency on `beam-runners-direct-java` and use it as their pipeline runner.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore seem futile to annotate tests outside the modules  `beam-sdks-java-core` and `beam-runners-core-java` with `@NeedsRunner`, however, this is not entirely the case.\r\n`TestPipeline` offers mechanisms to avoid common pitfalls when designing pipeline tests,  mechanisms that are activated by detecting a `@NeedsRunner` / `@RunnableOnService` annotation on a test. Thus it may be worthwhile adding a `@NeedsRunner` so that these mechanisms are activated and can do their job.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `@NeedsRunner` can be omitted, and these mechanisms can be activated manually by setting `testPipeline.enableAbandonedNodeEnforcement(true)` as part of the test.

for your comments.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right that this is very similar to what the example integration tests do. I spent a bunch of time trying to get it working the same way as the example ITs, but it's quite tricky. The problems are:\r\n1.  the runners have a dependency on the IOs - kafka/pubsub in particular. This means you can't have the IO module depend on the runners (and especially not the parent IO)\r\n2. Simultaneously, you have to have all the proper jars included in the classpath for dataflow & spark to be able to pick them up. \r\n3. You have to pass parameters to the integration test, but can't use beamTestPiplineOptions since if you run verify, it'll also run the unit tests, and those don't understand the pipelineoptions for the IOs.\r\n\r\nBetween all those issues, I couldn't immediately get an examples-like version of this to work. I really tried :)\r\n\r\nAs I mention in the commit message (but I'm realizing now, that isn't easily visible here), this is a temporary measure. The long term plan I'm thinking about is to have an aggregator module that depends on both the runner and the IOs, and run the tests there, but I'd like to get the Jdbc IT running so that jason can start having perfkit running and calling this IT. \r\n\r\nI'll update the comments in the file to reflect this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/282359254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/282359488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2097#issuecomment-282359488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2097","id":282359488,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjM1OTQ4OA==","user":{"login":"tibkiss","id":113485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss","html_url":"https://github.com/tibkiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tibkiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T17:59:37Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T17:59:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've noticed that the error message contains `sys.version` (which contains new lines).
