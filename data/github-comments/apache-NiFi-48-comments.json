There does not appear to be a cross-browser support for masking `textareas` (multi-line input). There exists sensitive properties that currently expect the field to support multi-line input. The `input[type=password]` only supports a single line.\r\n\r\nI think we would need to introduce a new attribute of `PropetyDescriptor` which would drive whether or not to use a masked single line input or the existing multi-line `textarea`. The existing multi-line `textareas` support sensitive by not returning/showing the value once set. We would not be able to support a `PropertyDescriptor` that requires masking and multi-line input.\r\n\r\nAdditional complications exist for sensitive properties that support expression language. We'd have to spend some time to determine if `CodeMirror` supports masking or if it's possible to introduce that sort of capability.
