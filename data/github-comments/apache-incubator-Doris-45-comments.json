There are two problems here\r\n> 1 DppUtils.getHashValue() didn't deal with date type, so no bytes is added here, so result is wrong;\r\n> 2 I create a table with Integer type and using `Spark Load` to load data, but I didn't reproduce it; The case is as below;\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> table:\r\n> CREATE TABLE `test_int_bucket` (\r\n>   `tinyint_col` tinyint(4) NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n>   `smallint_col` smallint(6) NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n>   `int_col` int(11) NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n>   `bigint_col` bigint(20) NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n>   `pv_sum` int(11) SUM NULL COMMENT \"\"\r\n> ) ENGINE=OLAP\r\n> AGGREGATE KEY(`tinyint_col`, `smallint_col`, `int_col`, `bigint_col`)\r\n> COMMENT \"OLAP\"\r\n> DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`tinyint_col`,`smallint_col`,`int_col`,`bigint_col`) BUCKETS 3\r\n> PROPERTIES (\r\n> \"replication_num\" = \"1\",\r\n> \"in_memory\" = \"false\",\r\n> \"storage_format\" = \"DEFAULT\"\r\n> ); \r\n> \r\n> data:\r\n> mysql> select * from test_int_bucket;\r\n> +-------------+--------------+---------+------------+--------+\r\n> | tinyint_col | smallint_col | int_col | bigint_col | pv_sum |\r\n> +-------------+--------------+---------+------------+--------+\r\n> |           1 |            1 |       1 |          1 |      1 |\r\n> |           4 |            4 |       4 |          4 |      4 |\r\n> |           2 |            2 |       2 |          2 |      2 |\r\n> |           3 |            3 |       3 |          3 |      3 |\r\n> +-------------+--------------+---------+------------+--------+\r\n> 4 rows in set (0.01 sec)\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> query:\r\n> mysql> select count(1) from test_int_bucket where bigint_col=1;\r\n> +----------+\r\n> | count(1) |\r\n> +----------+\r\n> |        1 |\r\n> +----------+\r\n> 1 row in set (0.02 sec)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nsorry for the wrong case. In the procedure you provided, the distributed key should be only one column like below:\r\nCREATE TABLE `test_int_bucket` (\r\n  `int_col` int(11) NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n  `pv_sum` int(11) SUM NULL COMMENT \"\"\r\n) ENGINE=OLAP\r\nAGGREGATE KEY(`int_col`)\r\nCOMMENT \"OLAP\"\r\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`int_col`) BUCKETS 10\r\nPROPERTIES (\r\n\"replication_num\" = \"1\",\r\n\"in_memory\" = \"false\",\r\n\"storage_format\" = \"DEFAULT\"\r\n); \r\nIt is recommended to increase the bucket number so that it would be easier to to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to change the query to below:\r\nselect count(1) from test_int_bucket where tinyint_col=1 and smallint_col=1 and int_col=1 and bigint_col=1;\r\nThe key is to make the query plan scan ONLY ONE BUCKET that contains the target data. The problem here is that the query goes to the wrong tablet, not that the data itself (i.e. if scanning all tablet, the result wont go wrong).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/864511062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/864511555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/6009#issuecomment-864511555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/6009","id":864511555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NDUxMTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"kchen-shanghai","id":14072407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDcyNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14072407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai","html_url":"https://github.com/kchen-shanghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchen-shanghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-20T07:23:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T07:23:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"if checking 'explain select count(1) from test_int_bucket where bigint_col=1;' on the provided case, the query plan should be a full db scan on all buckets.

@harveyyue , thanks for your PR.\r\n> one more thing, i want to keep 100 partitions with set dynamic_partition.start=-100, and want to create 20 old partitions rather than getting 100 old partitions.\r\n\r\nDepending on your needs, it is necessary to add the `dynamic_partition.history_partition_num` parameter. But there is no need to set default value for `history_partition_num`.\r\n\r\nControl the behavior of automatic history partition creation based on the three parameters,  `start`,`create_history_partition`,`history_partition_num`.\r\n\r\nHere's the suggested logic pseudocode:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nexpect_create_partition_num;\r\n\r\nif (!create_history_partition) {\r\n  start = 0;\r\n  expect_create_partition_num = end - start;\r\n} else {\r\n  if (history_partition_num != 0) {\r\n    expect_create_partition_num = end - MAX(start, -history_partition_num);\r\n  } else {\r\n    if (start == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\r\n      throw exception\r\n    }\r\n    expect_create_partition_num = end - start;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (expect_create_partition_num > max_dynamic_partition_num) {\r\n  throw exception\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can add this logic in function: https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/blob/ba84eacb8c2d0d70bff9fc43f7d13b7382384aed/fe/fe-core/src/main/java/org/apache/doris/common/util/DynamicPartitionUtil.java#L295\r\n\r\nHere is detail code: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/blob/ba84eacb8c2d0d70bff9fc43f7d13b7382384aed/fe/fe-core/src/main/java/org/apache/doris/common/util/DynamicPartitionUtil.java#L351-L359\r\n\r\nBy the way, you also need to update dynamic partition doc [https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/blob/master/docs/en/administrator-guide/dynamic-partition.md](url), for both Chinese and English.\r\n\r\nIf you
