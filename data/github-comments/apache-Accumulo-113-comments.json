The full ITs all passed so this is ready for a review from you to see what you think. I'll leave it as a draft PR for now but can switch it if you think it looks ok but I'm sure there are some things that need fixing. The next step would be to write an IT to test out adding ranges to the metadata table and reading them with the iterator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1596233097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1598880557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3384#issuecomment-1598880557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3384","id":1598880557,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5fTPst","user":{"login":"EdColeman","id":7047700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDc3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7047700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman","html_url":"https://github.com/EdColeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdColeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-20T14:14:53Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T14:14:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Superseded with #3508.

Make sure we validate file metadata on insertion/updates in MetadataConstraints. This is the work that is being done with #3504 and #3505. The validation done here could still be switched to using a more optimized version in the constructor (the change in this PR) to make it faster when we do need to validate and we need to eagerly load the TabletFile.\r\n2. Avoid validating when we don't need to.

I can imagine other scenarios where a user has done that for surgical/maintenance reasons (like maybe manually compacting some files that is inconvenient for them to compact using our built-in compactors), and may have their own naming convention for the file they place (and for which they add an entry to the metadata table).\r\n\r\nThis validation could break that situation where users have done that.... and not for any great reason.

I should have used that after the 2.1.1 release. Instead, I just manually resolved the conflicts (using vim, one file at a time, from an SSH terminal on my phone, in the waiting room while my vehicle was getting an oil change and tire rotation). That would have **really** saved me the effort!!! :face_exhaling:\r\n\r\n> One thing I thought of is if you use `git merge -s ours` does it only skip conflicting commits or will it not bring in any commits? Would it sill merge in commits from the source branch that merge cleanly?\r\n\r\nIt brings in references to any number of HEADs being merged in, but does not change anything in the destination branch. So, if there were more than one commit in the history that you're merging in this way, you should merge that forward the regular way first. I always check that the parent is merged first, before merging anything with `-sours`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git remote update upstream\r\n$ git checkout main && git merge upstream/main --ff-only # make sure working branch is up-to-date\r\n$ git merge upstream/2.1~1 # clean merge of 2.1's HEAD's parent commit with changes, adds one merge commit to main branch\r\n$ git merge upstream/2.1 -sours # include 2.1's HEAD without changes, adds second merge commit to main branch\r\n$ doSomeEditing # reimplement 2.1's HEAD in main branch\r\n$ git commit -a # adds a third commit to main branch for the reimplementation\r\n$ git push upstream main\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1601669775/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
