good to me in principle, but I have a few comments and a few questions.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things I wish we could do. Would you be willing to consider making some of those changes as well? Also, I am wondering what others think about these suggestions:\r\n\r\n- I see no reason why we would want to build 3 SQL jars, one for HDP, CDH and Apache distros. Can we try to combine them into a single jar? I talked about this to @prashanth-vasudev before and he also couldn't think of a reason why we need different jars.\r\n- Should we combine the core/sql, core/sql/lib_mgmt and possibly also core/common jars into one? We got so many different Maven projects.\r\n- This one is more long-term: Some day we could replace the org.trafodion in our class names with org.apache.trafodion, but that will require someone with a lot of spare time and patience...\r\n\r\nComments/questions related to the code:\r\n\r\n- Can you explain how this makes maintaining the code easier?\r\n- Can you explain the naming scheme? How would a person new to the project find these source files?\r\n- You also need to change the \"eclipse\" and \"sql/.project\" targets in core/Makefile.\r\n\r\nAgain, I see nothing wrong in principle with your change, just wanted to bring up some possible alternatives and considerations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/391541821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/391606976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1575#issuecomment-391606976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1575","id":391606976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTYwNjk3Ng==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T06:45:12Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T06:45:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New
