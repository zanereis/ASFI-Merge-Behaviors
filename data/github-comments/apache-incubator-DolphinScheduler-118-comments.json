Hi, you'd better format the log, it's hard to find the reason now. Does this exception occur in the master or worker module? Or how can this problem be reproduced?\r\nI think the possible reason is that you only start one node, and before the node receives the `NODE_REMOVED` event to send alert, it has closed the datasource. There are currently two places that will handle the `NODE_REMOVE` event.
