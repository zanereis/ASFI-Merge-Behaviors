Thanks so much for taking so much time to review this patch! I thought the patch is ready but clearly there was space for improvement. I have updated the patch to address all comments. I have gone over the patch carefully with the hope that I don't miss anything this time.\r\n\r\nBesides minor changes such as the method comment and removal of unused import, here are the bigger changes that were made:\r\n\r\n- Simplified the way we handle KafkaStorageException such that we no longer need to invoke `maybeAddLogFailureEvent()` if `KafkaStorageException` is caught.\r\n- Added a final static variable `ReplicaManager.OfflinePartition` and use it to make sure that KafkaStorageException is consistently returned when client attempts to access an offline replica. This is verified with the updated test code.\r\n- Replaced all usage of `kafka.common.KafkaStorageException` with `org.apache.kafka.common.errors.KafkaStorageException` so that we can remove `kafka.common.KafkaStorageException` going forward.\r\n- Added metric `OfflineReplicaCount` which counts the number of offline local replicas on a broker.\r\n- Added LogDirFailureChannel to Log and LogSegment and invoke `maybeAddLogFailureEvent()` right after the IOException is caught.\r\n- Renamed the new exception to UnknownErrorCodeException","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315308226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315320776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929#issuecomment-315320776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2929","id":315320776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTMyMDc3Ng==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T09:55:19Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T09:55:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-pr-jdk8-scala2.12/6053/\nTest FAILed (JDK 8 and Scala 2.12).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315320776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315323239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3526#issuecomment-315323239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3526","id":315323239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTMyMzIzOQ==","user":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T10:06:46Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T10:06:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma @junrao Can you review, please? Thank you...\r\n\r\nIn a busy cluster with lots of leader changes, produce requests may take a long time, causing channels to be muted for a long time, resulting in channel expiry even when there are staged receives. At the moment, a staged receive can be completed and the channel removed from the selector through expiry, resulting in `NullPointerException` in the broker. This can cause requests received from other clients in the poll to be dropped, causing correlation id mismatch in these clients (requiring a restart).\r\n\r\nThis PR performs `maybeCloseOldestConnection` before `addToCompletedReceives`, so that channel expiry is handled in the same way as other `close()`. It also removes `addToCompletedReceives` within `close()` to ensure that only one receive is completed for each channel per poll. I have added unit tests to check both these scenarios.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315323239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315324002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3526#issuecomment-315324002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3526","id":315324002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTMyNDAwMg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T10:10:39Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T10:10:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great find Rajini!

I improved the comments in a few places, removed unnecessary imports and reverted a few changes that have become unnecessary now. I sincerely think that I should have fixed these before your previous review.. \r\n\r\nFor ease of review, I have squashed the commits before your previous review into one commit ([link](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929/commits/c34eef1d09a120a9ec104279a04824f80f3b1c04)). The second commit ([link](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929/commits/2ab2b89d230995efc488fb7e42f7a13946f5c5ff)) includes the change that were made to address your previous comments from the previous review. The summary of this change can be found in the earlier comment I posted yesterday. The 3rd commit ([link](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929/commits/811353e51a4b73dcb316073e55f15979bf005395)\r\n) improved comment and reverted unnecessary changes.\r\n\r\nSome major changes where made based on that previous two rounds of review from you, e.g. introduction of the LogDirFailureChannel and the consistency of KafkaStorageException in response. I am 95% confident now that the patch won't need similar major change anymore in its current state. I will give this patch another two rounds of end-to-end review, make sure that there is indeed no further improvement I can figure out by myself, before giving it to you for further review.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315517505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/315519845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2929#issuecomment-315519845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2929","id":315519845,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTUxOTg0NQ==","user":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-15T08:40:00Z","updated_at":"2017-07-15T08:40:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer
