One of the streamparse original creators here. This is looking really interesting so far! I added a comment on #574 about recent happenings in pystorm & streamparse. But I agree with the approach you've taken of building your own pyheron interop layer and then just matching the duck-typed API that streamparse's Topology DSL and that pystorm components implement.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/237164876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/237283270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1203#issuecomment-237283270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1203","id":237283270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzI4MzI3MA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-03T16:05:13Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T16:05:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@daxwang - thanks for the use case, definitely interesting.
