Otherwise, return its parent’s effective storage policy.\r\nThe PR applied to the second rule。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/734683314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/734684079","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1481#issuecomment-734684079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1481","id":734684079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDY4NDA3OQ==","user":{"login":"zzcclp","id":9430290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzAyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9430290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp","html_url":"https://github.com/zzcclp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-27T07:14:14Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T07:14:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/734684079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/735366703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1490#issuecomment-735366703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1490","id":735366703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTM2NjcwMw==","user":{"login":"zzcclp","id":9430290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzAyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9430290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp","html_url":"https://github.com/zzcclp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzcclp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-29T09:34:19Z","updated_at":"2020-11-29T09:34:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ran test cases locally successfully.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/735366703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/comments/735369474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1490#issuecomment-735369474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1490","id":735369474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTM2OTQ3NA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-29T10:03:15Z","updated_at":"2020-11-29T10:03:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/kylin/pull/1490?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`kylin-on-parquet-v2@51ff5ec`).
