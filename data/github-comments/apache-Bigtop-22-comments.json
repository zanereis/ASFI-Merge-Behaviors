Why do we still need this in Bigtop??\r\n\r\nHi @iwasakims, \r\nYes, Ambari-2.8 would take Bigtop Mpack as the default stack, but there are still much work in Ambari-2.8 development and it hasn't been released yet. \r\nThere also maybe some work to support Ambari-2.8 in Bigtop and we would remove Mpack after Ambari-2.8 is released.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Bigtop offers the support for Ambari-2.7.5 (the latest stable version),  and its Mpack including more components and visual metrics (Ambari metrics service) are the main features of the comming 3.2 release which would provide the whole Bigdata management platform and software stack to make management of Hadoop easier and simpler for the developers and administrators.  \r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the ZK connection issues: Expected response imok, Actual response ruok is not executed because it is not in the whitelist.

I appreciate your effort for  moving the next Bigtop release forward. @guyuqi \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1330133159/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1330333308","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1056#issuecomment-1330333308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1056","id":1330333308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5PS0Z8","user":{"login":"guyuqi","id":20575685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTc1Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20575685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi","html_url":"https://github.com/guyuqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-29T09:27:39Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T09:27:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Confirmed that all tests/build processes were passed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1330333308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1330350682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1059#issuecomment-1330350682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1059","id":1330350682,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5PS4pa","user":{"login":"guyuqi","id":20575685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTc1Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20575685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi","html_url":"https://github.com/guyuqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guyuqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-29T09:41:58Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T09:41:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This PR is to align every version in MPack. \r\nI confirmed that all tests/builds were passed and it would not affect other Bigtop components.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1330350682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/comments/1330431820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/bigtop/pull/1054#issuecomment-1330431820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/bigtop/issues/1054","id":1330431820,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACDj7M5PTMdM","user":{"login":"iwasakims","id":1856607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTY2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1856607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims","html_url":"https://github.com/iwasakims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iwasakims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-29T10:44:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T10:44:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guyuqi I reverted this.
