Do we keep the output the same or update it? Obviously you are in favor of keeping things simple and not changing the output. @EdColeman was the one who initially suggested the format changes and from his recent comment he still is in favor of it for the reasons provided. We could make any format changes a follow on Issue if we wanted to do that to keep the scope of this PR smaller but as part of those changes I had to add extra logic and tracking and a new API to return the extra information to be displayed. `getEstimatedDiskUsage()` was added and returns the new object I created `TableDiskUsageResult` which supports the new format. If we don't intend to change the output then I can certainly just drop the new api/object and re-use the old API as suggested. I could go either way, mostly I would say the output should be whatever is most useful to the people who would be using the command. So really just need to make sure we are on the same page and then I can update this to do whatever.\r\n2. As noted, old implementation is server side vs client side for the Metadata scan currently. If we just want to keep it simple and just drop the HDFS implementation for getting file sizes and go with Metadata and not change command output then what should we do about the existing Thrift server call that wouldn't be needed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1248615630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1248800663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2792#issuecomment-1248800663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2792","id":1248800663,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Kby-X","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-16T01:03:43Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T01:03:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > So, I'm not convinced this is the right approach.\r\n> \r\n> What's the implication of this statement?

Either way, we should target deletion of the shell FateCommand in 3.0, so as long as FateCommand is deprecated, and Admin's \"fate\" command is fully functional, it should be enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1248814904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1248842652","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2898#issuecomment-1248842652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2898","id":1248842652,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Kb9Oc","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-16T02:29:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T02:29:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think the value of having the commas outweighs any parsing inconvenience for this log message at the trace level.

The less the GC trust that the persisted data it reads is correct and the more it tries to verify what it can about that data the more robust GC will be.   The GC already does a good bit of checks on the metadata table as it reads it.  Checking the metadata table against ZK will strengthen those existing verifications.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the check outlined in #1377, another check was added in #2293 for the case where table ids were seen in metadata table and none were seen in ZK.   This situation can legitimately happen when the total number of tables goes to/from zero concurrently with a GC cycle.  This situation could also happen when ZK read is silently failing and returning no data.  There is no way to distinguish between the two causes, so it can have false positives.  If the system is actually working correctly, then the legitimate case would be transient.   We could defer this second check and open an issue to do it another PR where we try to figure out how to avoid the false positive or make the check less noisy (like always skip GC cycle but log info at first and warn/error on subsequent cycles if seen again).  Or we could leave the check as-is in the PR with the knowledge that it can always be modified/removed in a bug fix release.  I lean towards leaving it and dealing with it if its problematic in a bug fix release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1249134891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1249205260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2898#issuecomment-1249205260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2898","id":1249205260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5KdVwM","user":{"login":"cfkoehler","id":83408002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDA4MDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83408002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler","html_url":"https://github.com/cfkoehler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cfkoehler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-16T10:34:07Z","updated_at":"2022-09-16T10:34:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry for the delay in responding.

I was thinking that having a known checked Exception in the SPI methods makes sense so that errors specific to crypto can be handled.\r\n\r\nFor most situations, I don't think there will be much we can do if we catch a CryptoException (coming from a TabletServer, for example) other than restart the server. Since these interfaces are in the SPI, the \"client\" who handles the exception will usually be server code. And with the way the CryptoService runs within the tserver, there is a good chance a restart will have to happen to reload the service. Eventually, once the Crypto is properly tested we could drop the experimental tag and be able to determine a better way of handling the errors. Or if we create a designated Server running just for Crypto, there may be better ways to handle the errors. The RFile API may be a good place to throw a checked exception for example, allowing the client to handle encryption errors.\r\n\r\nI do think there is room for improving the overall error handling though.
