I still have some doubts about the building. Which is the correct (best-practice?) to build druid with a given extension? So far I build in the following way:\n\n```\nmvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true\ncp -f services/target/druid-services-0.8.2-SNAPSHOT-selfcontained.jar /usr/local/druid/lib\njava \"-Ddruid.extensions.coordinates=[\\\"io.druid.extensions:druid-kafka-eight:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\\\",\\\"io.druid.extensions:mysql-metadata-storage:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\\\",\\\"io.druid.extensions:druid-cloudfiles-extensions:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\\\"]\" -Ddruid.extensions.localRepository=/usr/local/druid/repository \"-Ddruid.extensions.remoteRepositories=[\\\"file:///root/.m2/repository/\\\",\\\"http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/\\\",\\\"https://metamx.artifactoryonline.com/metamx/pub-libs-releases-local\\\"]\" -cp /usr/local/druid/lib/* io.druid.cli.Main tools pull-deps\ncd extensions/cloudfiles-extensions/\nmvn dependency:copy-dependencies \"-DoutputDirectory=/usr/local/druid/jclouds\"\ncd ../..\n```\n\nand then I run the nodes with the followings:\n\n```\njava -Xmx512m -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp config/_common:config/coordinator:/usr/local/druid/lib/*:/usr/local/druid/jclouds/* io.druid.cli.Main server coordinator\njava -Xmx512m -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp config/_common:config/historical:/usr/local/druid/lib/*:/usr/local/druid/jclouds/* io.druid.cli.Main server historical\njava -Xmx512m -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp config/_common:config/broker:/usr/local/druid/lib/*:/usr/local/druid/jclouds/* io.druid.cli.Main server broker\njava -Xmx512m -Duser.timezone=UTC -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Ddruid.realtime.specFile=config/realtime/kafka_realtime.spec -cp config/_common:config/realtime:/usr/local/druid/lib/*:/usr/local/druid/jclouds/* io.druid.cli.Main server realtime\n```\n\nwhere the properties regarding the extensions in `common.runtime.properties` are:\n\n```\ndruid.extensions.remoteRepositories=[]\ndruid.extensions.localRepository=/usr/local/druid/repository\ndruid.extensions.coordinates=[\"io.druid.extensions:druid-kafka-eight:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\",\"io.druid.extensions:mysql-metadata-storage:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\",\"io.druid.extensions:druid-cloudfiles-extensions:0.8.2-SNAPSHOT\"]\n```\n\nIn this way everythings works fine. But what are the expected steps that are supposed to be performed in order to build druid? I also tried to skip the part where I copy the dependencies of `cloudfiles-extensions`, but all the nodes seems to work fine except for the realtime one which complains about missing providers for jclouds. That's why I add the jclouds dependencies in the runtime classpath. Is there something missing from my side?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/141112483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/141113643","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1741#issuecomment-141113643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1741","id":141113643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTExMzY0Mw==","user":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-17T14:58:36Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T14:58:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/141113643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/141123816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1719#issuecomment-141123816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1719","id":141123816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTEyMzgxNg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-17T15:33:11Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T15:33:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good question.

concern:\n\nAn injective extraction function only need be injective for the domain of the dimension of interest in the query of interest. Injective is a query time property because the extraction function may not be injective for an arbitrary domain. As such, any particular extraction function's injective-ness across the set of all possible Strings is not currently a property of a lookup extraction's underlying data map. (it could be added but would require more data about lookups to be propagated around)\n\nWithout this change (or other rule enforcement) it is not possible to simply do a full scan of the range of the lookup transformation and guarantee that only the values of interest will return from the function, but since any values outside the dimension should be eventually ignored, this may not be a problem.\n\nTo do a full table scan of the dimension values, apply the lookup transformation, and filter on the values is what the dimension extraction filter currently does. The problem is that it cannot be applied in an optimized way (ex: at the broker) because the broker does not know what the potential dimension values are, it only can get the entire domain of the lookup.\n\nAdditionally, the lookup fn has the capacity to either retain or replace missing values, including the capacity to treat missing values as null. Such behavior would have to be preserved when doing an unApply.\n\nFrom prior conversations I'm assuming the point here is trying to make QTL have the capacity to avoid the full dimension-value scan for pattern matching. Doing so should be possible, but it may have to have very specific constraints on when it can be done.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/141497194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/141499319","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1719#issuecomment-141499319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1719","id":141499319,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTQ5OTMxOQ==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-18T16:29:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-18T16:29:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@se7entyse7en Hmmm, that's a problem.

task.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/142053041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/142055952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1754#issuecomment-142055952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1754","id":142055952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjA1NTk1Mg==","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T17:43:41Z","updated_at":"2015-09-21T17:43:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@drcrallen

For this kind of join, we actually need more functionality and I think it makes a lot of sense to enforce that in the interface in order to unify functionality.

The most simple case.\n\nThe current implementation permits the following functionality:\n\n```\n{\n  \"dim1Key1\":\"value1\",\n  \"dim1Key2\":\"value2\",\n  \"dim2Key1\":\"value1\",\n  \"dim2Key2\":\"value2\"\n}\n```\n\nFor a particular query you may only have dimension values `{\"dim1Key1\",\"dim1Key2\"}` or `{\"dim2Key1\",\"dim2Key2\"}` depending on which dimension you are extracting. As such, the individual ExtractionFn which uses the QTL-map can still be injective, since the domain of the dataSource dimension is a subset of the QTL key set. But the total key set for a QTL map (or set of all strings) may not be injective (because there are multiple instances of `value#` in it.\n\nSo, if you were to do a simple broker-level rewrite, you could do something like selecting `value1` to mean `dim1Key1 OR dim2Key1`. Which I think would end up being OK because one of the other might never be present.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/142061157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/142061343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/1754#issuecomment-142061343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1754","id":142061343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjA2MTM0Mw==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-21T17:58:09Z","updated_at":"2015-09-21T17:59:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cheddar do you have specific use cases that are not covered well by the simple QTL implementation that currently exists?
