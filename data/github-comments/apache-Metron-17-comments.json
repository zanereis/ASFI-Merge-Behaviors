I personally use Fedora for most of my development and testing of Metron.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I found that without using docker-machine, the kafkazk service did not start up properly due to the use of sed on the DOCKER_HOST variable in the Dockerfile to set the advertised.listeners parameter in kafka server.properties. I was using the docker-engine on the localhost and thought I would avoid the hassle of docker-machine. It was easy enough to solve by manually manipulating the server.properties file in the container, but I was wondering if this could be avoided somehow?\r\n\r\nI assume that had I installed docker-machine and used the provided script it would have worked as expected even on Fedora (I'm planning to test that case as well), but was curious why the use of the virtualbox driver?

I updated the documentation to include Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows.  One of the primary requirements for the way I use this is that containers must be accessible from my local environment where my IDE is running so services that broadcast their host address are tricky.  The Kafka advertised listener thing was the single most challenging issue I faced so not surprised you hit it too.  The Kafka Dockerfile is wired to pull the DOCKER_HOST from an input argument and the compose file is wired to pass the local DOCKER_HOST environment variable as the DOCKER_HOST input argument to the Kafka Dockerfile.  So you should be able to set your local DOCKER_HOST environment variable as such:\r\n\r\n$ export DOCKER_HOST=\"tcp://<your docker host>:2376\"\r\n\r\nWhen you run \"eval $(docker-machine env metron-machine)\" that's pretty much what Docker Machine is doing, setting local environment variables to match the desired host.  Then after you build the environment, the advertised.listener property should be set to <your docker host> without you having to manually change it.  \r\n\r\nI only used the virtualbox drive because that's what came out of the box.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/268084862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/268240765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/399#issuecomment-268240765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/399","id":268240765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODI0MDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-20T13:18:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T13:18:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the contribution!\r\n\r\nTested with jekyll serve and safari.

It is definitely worthwhile to refactor a CuratorZkConfigManager class out of ConfiguredBolt.  In fact, when we do, we really should propose the Storm team adopt it; it would be tremendously valuable for lots of Storm applications.  HOWEVER, this is a significant task in its own right and more than a couple days' work.  I believe there is a much simpler solution for the short term, that either avoids or mostly avoids the split implementation problem (depending on a Storm detail that I wasn't able to determine), so I don't recommend we make Nick do it as part of this task.\r\n\r\n2. I agree with @merrimanr and @cestella that we should not lose the established functionality of ConfiguredBolt for managing ProfilerConfigurations, nor create a new config management and caching mechanism, even with good intentions about putting it all back together in the future.\r\n\r\n3. After analyzing what goes into the class hierarchies, I see that:\r\na) The way BaseWindowedBolt manages its windowConfiguration is qualitatively different from the Curated Zk based management used by ConfiguredBolt.  It would be hard to merge them, and that's what is causing the current problem.\r\nb) But it isn't necessary, because the config management built into BaseWindowedBolt is just a distraction.\r\n\r\nWhat's necessary to use Storm Windowing is that:\r\n- the Bolt implements IWindowedBolt interface, \r\n- a certain set of 7 parameters (defined by example in BaseWindowedBolt) is presented to Storm when it queries the Bolt's getComponentConfiguration() method,\r\n- and the Storm topology correctly identifies the Bolt as being a Windowed Bolt.\r\n\r\nThe only question in my mind is the last bullet.  Does Storm identify the Bolt as Windowed just because it presents the windowing parameters in getComponentConfiguration() ?  Or does it do class reflection on the Bolt?  If it uses reflection, is it looking for IWindowedBolt or for BaseWindowedBolt ?\r\n\r\nIt is likely that one of the first two is sufficient to identify the Bolt as Windowed.  If so, there's a very easy solution to all this.  Define:\r\n```\r\npublic abstract class ConfiguredWindowedBolt<CONFIG_T extends Configurations> \r\n\textends ConfiguredBolt<CONFIG_T> implements IWindowedBolt\r\n\t\t{with only a few lines of content needed}\r\nand\r\npublic abstract class ConfiguredProfilerBolt \r\n\textends ConfiguredWindowedBolt<ProfilerConfigurations> \r\n```\r\nThis compiles on the master codeline; I can share my straw man if desired.\r\nThen change `getComponentConfiguration()` in ProfileBuilderBolt, to return the 7 windowing-related config parameters instead of TOPOLOGY_TICK_TUPLE_FREQ_SECS.  Other than changes to add the windowing params to the ProfilerConfigurations on a per-bolt basis, the current config management code in ConfiguredProfilerBolt and ConfiguredBolt can be used just as is.\r\n\r\nIf Storm actually requires the Bolt to be of type BaseWindowedBolt, then it is a little uglier, but still doable:  Copy the methods of ConfiguredBolt into a new class that extends BaseWindowedBolt, simply overriding any conflicting methods already in BaseWindowedBolt.  We have to duplicate the code, but it can be copied verbatim, thereby giving much higher reliability than new code.\r\nAgain, there's no need to try to use the configuration management code built into BaseWindowedBolt; only what gets returned in `getComponentConfiguration()` is important.\r\n\r\nI don't expect either of these solutions to give great joy, but it is workable and can be done reliably.  We don't need to refactor ConfiguredBolt, and its curated config management can be used whole.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/268510670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/268532377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/395#issuecomment-268532377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/395","id":268532377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODUzMjM3Nw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T14:14:22Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T14:14:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mattf-horton @mmiklavc  First off, thanks for the perspective, both of you.  While I think we should investigate your suggestion, @mattf-horton , it appears on the face of it quite dependent upon implementation decisions and details inside of Storm.  That immediately gives me pause.  That being said, I'll repeat that I think we should consider it strongly.\r\n\r\nI do agree with @mattf-horton that pulling out the `ZkConfigurationManager` here would be substantially more work if you consider the impact to our tests and the increased amount of testing that we would have to add to this PR.  I think, as @mmiklavc suggested, it's a separate PR.

You can implement windows yourself by \r\nreturning a HashMap from getComponentConfiguration in your custom bolt (as long as they also \r\nimplement the IWindowedBolt interface).\r\n```\r\nWorth noting, though, that if the Bolt implements BOTH IBolt and IWindowedBolt (as I contemplated), then you might have to cast it to (IWindowedBolt) in the call to setBolt().\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/268618409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/268619934","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/395#issuecomment-268619934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/395","id":268619934,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODYxOTkzNA==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T19:41:49Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T19:41:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"No problem @nickwallen, I agree you shouldn't have to tackle all of this on your own.

I ran a quick perf test on this function as it stands.  On my macbook from 4 years ago, I ran the `STATS_BIN` function a million times with random values and it took ~5.5s.  Even at a throughput of 1M messages per second, if we assume that the messages are spread across the cluster, I think this keeps up.\r\n\r\nNow, *EVEN GIVEN THIS*, normally I would go through the effort here of adding a caching layer to save us the computation of the percentile, but it's actually quite difficult to figure out when two `StatisticsProvider` objects are equivalent without resorting to actually calling percentiles.  I could do things like use non-computed attributes (number of data points, sum of data points, average and sum of data points), but the former Math grad student in me was uncomfortable in that.  It's just very hard to not be absolutely sure that you couldn't have all of those attributes the same and be different distributions.\r\n\r\nI think given these things together that I'm going to recommend to cross the caching bridge when we come to it.

The sampling portion is happening in the profiler as you construct the statistical distribution.  This is just querying the already constructed distribution.  This is intended to be an input into a model and to give a sense of where a value falls in the distribution of values that have preceded it, so if you want a message to be used by your model, then it'll need to be computed and passed.\r\n\r\nI'll give you an example that may help clarify.  Let's say I'm building a really, really naive model over DNS requests to determine if a DNS request is being made for a synthetic domain created by a botnet.  One of the features I might be interested in may be the length of the domain.  However, I may also want to get a sense of if this domain's length is outside of the norm or not.  To do that, I'd create a profile that captures the statistical distribution of the length of the domains that have been requested in the past and when I'm calling the model (which is deployed via Model as a Service), I can pass the statistical bin that the length falls into (e.g. between the min-25th percentile, 25 - 50th percentile, 50th - 75th percentile or 75th - 95th percentile, 95th - max) by using this function.

I didn't see one in that thread, but I could have just missed it.  Are we sure commons validator wouldn't have the same issue?  I'm fine with validating them and then parsing if we're stuck dealing with Java implementation quirks.\r\n\r\nSpecifically on the square brackets issue, it sounds like (and this is way out of my wheelhouse, so forgive my potential ignorance) that these characters (and others) qualify as unwise (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt) and should be escaped, which is why Java is strict about them.\r\n\r\nCould we appropriately escape the offending characters and end up with a correct URI? If commons has something to validate a URL, is there something to do that escaping for us?  If that works, do we potentially want to be doing operations on URIs instead of URLs, e.g. `URI_TO_PATH`, `URI_TO_HOST`?  Obviously, this raises the question of what we do the URL* functions and coexistence.\r\n\r\nIn terms of test cases, I'd want to see something with the unwise character issue (but I don't have an example of that myself).  I can help you try to dig one up if you want.

The last one will definitely require some work and should be a separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270185796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270187031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/393#issuecomment-270187031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/393","id":270187031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDE4NzAzMQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T18:32:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T18:32:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Maybe we can create jiras for these, and someone else might help?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270187031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270188629","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/393#issuecomment-270188629","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/393","id":270188629,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDE4ODYyOQ==","user":{"login":"kylerichardson","id":10392029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkyMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10392029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson","html_url":"https://github.com/kylerichardson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-03T18:39:16Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T20:32:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've created METRON-646 for the elasticsearch image customizations.

Under what scenarios do you think this additional information would help?\r\n\r\nThe script was primarily made to capture 'static' bits of platform information that might prevent a successful build or deployment of Metron.\r\n\r\nThe changes you have made have added some 'dynamic' bits; aka CPU, memory.  For these changes to help, the script would have to be run exactly when there are high CPU/memory conditions.  I don't know if this is possible.  \r\n\r\nWhat I have seen happen is that the guest OS maxes out memory and starts harvesting/killing processes.  This effectively kills some service needed by Metron and prevents Metron from working.  But once the processes are killed, the memory use drops.  So if I am having problems with Metron and run the script it is just as likely to report no memory problems, even though it was actually the lack of memory that caused the problem.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am thinking about the use case wrong here.  Please correct me if you disagree.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270428440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270431635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/411#issuecomment-270431635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/411","id":270431635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQzMTYzNQ==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T17:28:44Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T03:47:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickwallen Right.

Destroy the vagrant instance (see `/usr/local/metron/*/metron-deployment/vagrant/full-dev-platform`)\r\n1. `./setup.sh -fvst full`\r\n    * You should get the issue.\r\n        * Adding `-t` prevents `setup.sh` from adding `scp_if_ssh` to `ansible.cfg`, and you will see the error.  For the most pristine testing, I reinstalled the OS or reverted to an early snapshot for each run of `setup.sh`.  Finally:\r\n1. Kill the vagrant instance again\r\n1. `./setup.sh -fvst -p 411 full`\r\n    * This runs the setup process without adding scp_if_ssh, but it merges in this PR before building Metron and starting vagrant.  You should not see the issue.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* `full` can be substituted with `quick`, `fastcapa`, or `codelab` for testing the different vagrant deploy methods.  As you're aware, for a good fastcapa build, this currently requires `-p 410`, but that's mostly not relevant here.\r\n* Obviously it's probably worth reviewing `setup.sh` to see exactly what's happening, but the `-v` provides some amount of feedback.\r\n* There is a `-d` flag which adds `ansible.verbose = \"vvvv\"` to the Vagrantfile prior to doing `vagrant up` and then removes it after completion for additional troubleshooting.\r\n* All the script really does is setup up all the dependencies.  From time to time, running `setup.sh` will fail because something upstream is being sync'd or performing maintenance/having issues, and a rerun usually fixes the issue.\r\n* The script is currently super inefficient and doesn't check to see if something's already installed before attempting to install it.\r\n\r\nHappy to help provide any additional detail as would be helpful.  I wasn't able to pin this down exactly, but I have seen 3 others independently report this issue and the fix worked for them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270431635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/270433761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/400#issuecomment-270433761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/400","id":270433761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDQzMzc2MQ==","user":{"login":"anandsubbu","id":20395490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzk1NDkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20395490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/anandsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anandsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T17:36:49Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T17:36:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @nickwallen , thank you for the review. \r\n\r\nAt the outset, getting the system CPU and Memory info would help troubleshooting, especially for single node deployments which are attempted on environments with scarce resources (This [thread](https://community.hortonworks.com/questions/51666/apache-metron-single-node-installation-problems.html) for example).\r\n\r\nMy intention is in fact to capture the 'static' system information.

I think there should be `metron-rest` and `metron-rest-client`. The idea would be to move the models into the client module. Specifically the models returned by the endpoints and are used when making requests. I personally like to to do this because it allows a user to use the client without having to bring a ton of dependencies onto their classpath. This is assuming there will eventually be a client module. Does this make sense? Think it is worth doing now?\r\n\r\n**Response Behavior:**\r\n\r\nI think we should also decide how Metron's APIs handle errors. In the past I have defined an error response type that was used by all endpoints. It could potentially look something like:\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"responseCode\" : 404, \r\n  \"message\" : \"Could not find parser config.\", \r\n  'fullMessage\" : \"Could not find parser config with the name: [some name]\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nAlso, I personally do not like to throw exceptions of type `Exception`. I think we could do a couple things. We could create a MetronRestException that gets mapped to an error response. We could also have the service layer use an `Either` type which would either return the response entity or a set of error responses. Do you all think this is worth talking about now? I think this is always one of those things that's tough to decide, but should be standard across the API.\r\n\r\n**API Documentation:**\r\n\r\nI think it is worth documenting all the different response types for each endpoint. For example, the endpoint `/api/v1/sensorParserConfigHistory` only describes the response for a 200 code, but there is also a 404.
