We have traditionally tried to be as permissive as possible about errors that are associated with missing data.  I think you can make an argument for malformed URLs to be a proper error, but it has historically not been mostly because it was considered a semantic error.  The original concern was you might want to transform fields which were inconsistently populated or populated with default values some of the time.  In that case, if the field is malformed then the URL that it produced should be `null`.  You still have the original field and can make decisions downstream in enrichment or threat triage.\n\nContrasting that would be syntactic or systemic errors, like passing in a number when you intended a string.  These would indicate a high likelihood of misconfiguration, so should be errors.  This was the original thinking behind when stellar functions error and when they tolerate variable input.\n\nI think it is high time to provide an `EXCEPTION` function so you can choose to throw an exception under certain circumstances if you want a more conservative interpretation of error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/257412096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/257413784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/333#issuecomment-257413784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/333","id":257413784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzQxMzc4NA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T20:39:05Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T20:39:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I wanted to add, I'm just giving historical context on why decisions were made because recent discussions have been around what to do around error states in stellar functions.

We definitely need to exclude the SLF4J bindings that we don't use.  The most common one is the Log4J2 binding that Storm brings along (\"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl\").  \n\nIt could be argued that we don't need to exclude the binding we are using (\"org.slf4j:slf4j-api\") and control the version through dependency management as you suggest.  The downside I see there though is that if we ever did want to change the logging implementation we would have to go through all the poms and exclude that binding (what's already been done here).
