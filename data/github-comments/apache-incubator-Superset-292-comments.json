The problem is multifold.\r\n\r\n1. `shouldComponentUpdate` is probably too strict. I [changed it](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9333/commits/7589b46bf127979b2dc24e518d94ecc5d4e52a6d#diff-b8d51b9ed2063863add2f7509be1b719R91) to only return false when `chartStatus` is updated from `success` to `rendered`.\r\n2. Because `SuperChart` uses [memoized async loaders](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/26ed9e31c6fd8950b01f8170836695cc9823192a/packages/superset-ui-chart/src/components/SuperChartCore.tsx#L93-L135) to load chart component, sometimes it confuses `react-hot-loader` when the module should be reloaded. The hack is to [add a unique key](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9333/commits/7589b46bf127979b2dc24e518d94ecc5d4e52a6d#diff-b8d51b9ed2063863add2f7509be1b719R233) to `SuperChart` component in `ChartRenderer` so it will always be rerendered.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, sometimes hot reload still doesn't work for charts in the dashboards. Considering the Explore page is normally where developers test + develop the charts, and they can always do a \"cold\" refresh, I'll stop digging and leave it as is. I did, however, [rewrite](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9333/commits/d5c8fd1caf482ea7ebd6f53bc00152cddb83fd99) `dashboard/App.jsx` and `dashboard/index.jsx` to avoid the same \"<Provider> does not support change store on the fly\" error as seen  [in the Explore page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9326#discussion_r394777930).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/602134435/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/602176951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9346#issuecomment-602176951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9346","id":602176951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjE3Njk1MQ==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-22T10:27:50Z","updated_at":"2020-03-22T10:27:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9346?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#9346](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9346?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/ccf21f6f1b51dd7eaa3f7d23861ba7d1820ab99d&el=desc) will **not change** coverage by `%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9346/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=KsB0fHcx6l)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9346?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #9346   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   58.96%   58.96%           \n=======================================\n  Files         374      374           \n  Lines       12137    12137           \n  Branches     2992     2992           \n=======================================\n  Hits         7156     7156           \n  Misses       4802     4802           \n  Partials      179      179           \n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9346?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9346?src=pr&el=footer).

Thoughts?\r\n\r\nI suspect there will be a proliferation of these little preference switches as we go through and implement the SIP-34 redesign. I think rather than having them scattered all over, it might make sense to have a \"preferences\" pane, either on the Profile view, or on a new view alongside it. There, preferences could be organized by section or theme, and organized hierarchically if needed. I'm happy to take a stab at a design pattern for that.\r\n\r\nAll that said, a new view seems outside the scope of this ticket. If there's a way to make this a user preference rather than an env setting in the shorter term without adding too much complexity here, that seems like a reasonable compromise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/602272074/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/602303093","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8366#issuecomment-602303093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8366","id":602303093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjMwMzA5Mw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-23T00:10:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-23T00:10:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

guess this is related to some modifications of UI files (Images, JS, etc.).\r\nI also find it very inconvenient to  modify look and feel to ones individual needs - especially addressing the OpenSource community.\r\n\r\nAs I'm using docker I ended up creating a complete dedicated dockerfile for my own customizations as the old one was kind of ... suboptimal. In the latest release I recognized a lot of work around the docker images, which is great and cleaned up a lot.\r\n\r\nBut still: Can someone elaborate which is the GOTO solution to change a UI asset in a docker production scenario?  \r\n\r\n- fork, add files, build from scratch\r\n- use e.g. docker, add npm (to prod!?), add the files to  image (hack dockerfile?), npm compile  \r\n- use e.g. docker, add npm (to prod!?), add the files using volumes\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have something like a modification folder that's picked up and merged (overwrites only the added files).  This would allow in most cases to stick with release images - which you can't in the other cases (or I simply found not the right way of doing it out of the box).
