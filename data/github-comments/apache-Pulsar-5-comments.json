: we have admin-client change in this [commit](https://github.com/rdhabalia/pulsar/commit/f7cb87341843377d82f2d0e4e64a790745efc760) which does uri encoding. But now, as broker supports both encoding ([TestCase](https://github.com/yahoo/pulsar/blob/48154fc50aa24e6c1e01db612744aa9e0e3733b3/pulsar-broker/src/test/java/com/yahoo/pulsar/broker/admin/AdminApiTest.java#L1499)) so, we haven't merged the change int this PR.

If client misses to ack one of the message then it creates an ack-hole and it prevents markDeletePosition to move forward from that position.\r\n> Always in the same ledgerId and partitionIndex\r\n\r\nIt seems a client is failing to process that exact message due to unexpected exception. And therefore, it creates ack-hole which always keeps ```markDeletePosition``` on that message-id and broker-restarts starts dispatching message from that message-position.\r\n\r\nYou can verify this behavior before restarting the broker.\r\n1. How to verify markDeletePosition and missing ack-message?\r\nYou can verify it using [pulsar-admin-stats](https://github.com/yahoo/pulsar/blob/master/docs/AdminTools.md#get-detailed-stats).\r\nFor example: partitioned topic : stats for partition-1\r\n```pulsar-admin persistent stats-internal persistent://test-property/cl1/ns1/tp1-partition-1```\r\nunder your subscriber name : we can see two specific fields:\r\n```\r\n\"cursors\": {\r\n        \"my-subscription\": {\r\n            \"markDeletePosition\": \"324711539:3133\",\r\n            \"individuallyDeletedMessages\": \"[(324711539:3134‥324711539:3136], (324711539:3137‥324711539:3140], ]\",    \r\n             :\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n```markDeletePosition```: MessageId position which will be persisted and in case of broker-restart:  broker will start dispatching message from that position.\r\n```individuallyDeletedMessages```:[list of range](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/RangesExplained#building-ranges) of ack-messages. In above example: consumer has not acked ```324711539:3134 and 324711539:3137```. So, it can help you to debug why client has not acked that specific message.\r\n\r\nYou can also use [REST-API](https://github.com/yahoo/pulsar/blob/master/docs/AdminTools.md#get-detailed-stats) to get the same stats:\r\n```\r\nGET /admin/persistent/{property}/{cluster}/{namespace}/{destination}/internalStats\r\n```\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/admin/persistent/test-property/cl1/ns1/tp1-partition-1/internalStats\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/268416078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/268473482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/150#issuecomment-268473482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/150","id":268473482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODQ3MzQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T09:13:36Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T09:13:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@estebangarcia The other thing is that the frequency at which the `markDelete` position is persisted is configurable in the [`broker.conf`](https://github.com/yahoo/pulsar/blob/master/conf/broker.conf#L178) file: \r\n\r\n```properties\r\n# Rate limit the amount of writes generated by consumer acking the messages\r\nmanagedLedgerDefaultMarkDeleteRateLimit=0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat means, the default (per broker) is to save it every 10secs.

this is another area where we need to add more documentation. \r\n\r\nWe use the BookKeeper rack-aware placement policy. The \"rack\" concept can be anything, (rack/region/availability zone). The base idea is: when forming the ensemble for a new ledger, pick bookies from different racks, to reduce the chances of data unavailability. \r\n\r\nIf bookies from different racks are not available, the policy falls back to chose randomly across available bookies.\r\n\r\nThe `ZkBookieRackAffinityMapping` is a way to feed the rack information into the rack-aware policy. The JSON z-node content you've attached looks correct. The first level is the group-name, and can be used to provide bookie isolation (strictly picking from a subset of bookies).\r\n\r\nYou only need to update the `/bookies` z-node when you add new bookies. There is no need to update it when processes are up or down, that is controlled by the list in `/ledgers/available`.\r\n\r\nIf the `/bookies` z-node is not there, the BK client will choose randomly. Same thing if all bookies are in the same \"rack\" (whatever that means).\r\n\r\nSo, in AWS, you'd probably want to create instances in different AZs and update the `/bookies` z-node to reflect that. \r\n\r\n> My main question here is, are we doing it right ? 😛\r\n\r\nYes, just make sure you have bookies from different \"racks\" in the configuration.\r\n\r\n> And how can we check if it's working?\r\n\r\nYou should be able to verify that all ledgers should have the ensemble containing bookies from different AZs :\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/bookkeeper shell ledgermetadata -ledgerid $MY_LEDGER_ID\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Should we tell pulsar to use this class ?\r\n\r\nIt's automatically used when `bookkeeperClientRackawarePolicyEnabled=true` is set on

You have the values from the config file + the values in ZK. There should be a clear way to understand what is the actual configuration that is:\r\n * Supposed to be applied to all brokers\r\n * It's *actually* being applied in a given broker... \r\n\r\nOther problem is how to clearly identify which values are dynamically tunable (eg: zk servers string will not be dynamic...)

I haven't checked the code there but maybe there's a way to prevent both tasks from running st the same time.\r\n\r\nI think we can remove ```splitTaskConfiguration(loadBalancerNamespaceBundleSplitIntervalMinutes)``` instead keep its value as ```loadBalancerReportUpdateMaxIntervalMinutes + 5```  because we have to make sure that [splitBundle](https://github.com/yahoo/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/com/yahoo/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/SimpleLoadManagerImpl.java#L1352) should run only after [loadReport](https://github.com/yahoo/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/com/yahoo/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/SimpleLoadManagerImpl.java#L1200) gets updated, otherwise there could be a possibility to read stale loadReport value.\r\nAny thought?
