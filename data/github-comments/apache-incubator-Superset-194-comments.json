doing some more thinking on this and would like to extend the feature to be more dynamic, so that we can actually turn features on and off based on user attributes or perhaps other context. It'd be powerful to be able to use a hook here to do progressive releases (1%, 5%, 10%, ...), or based on roles (say an 'early_adopter' role).\r\n\r\nAs a static-per-environment feature (like it is now) it doesn't offer much more than the `app.config` offers already. Let's think of ways to make it more dynamic.\r\n\r\nAt first I was thinking about exposing a function in config `GET_FEATURE_FLAGS()`, and by its nature it'd have access to the `user` and `request` objects that are provided by Flask/FAB. Since we want the framework to work both on the backend AND frontend, I think it has to be a function that returns the whole dict of flags so that it can be computed on the backend and sent to the frontend (as opposed to a `GET_SINGLE_FEATURE_FLAG(flag)` function).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459848093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459849305","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6803#issuecomment-459849305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6803","id":459849305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTg0OTMwNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T20:00:10Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T20:00:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh interesting, sorting on `.items()` makes no sense, now I'm wondering how this was passing unit tests.\r\n\r\nLGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459849305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459851837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6801#issuecomment-459851837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6801","id":459851837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTg1MTgzNw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-01T20:08:48Z","updated_at":"2019-02-01T20:08:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6801?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#6801](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6801?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/commit/5669a823508b317648ccbca4de62fbd4e8420a98?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6801/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=KsB0fHcx6l&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6801?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #6801   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   56.07%   56.07%           \n=======================================\n  Files         526      526           \n  Lines       23253    23253           \n  Branches     2783     2783           \n=======================================\n  Hits        13038    13038           \n  Misses       9806     9806           \n  Partials      409      409\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6801?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** -

A query like this will give some PQL NullPointerException:\r\n\r\nSELECT a as A, \r\n       DATETIMECONVERT(t, \"1:SECONDS:EPOCH\", \"1:SECONDS:EPOCH\", \"1:DAYS\") as __timestamp,\r\n       count(1) as count\r\nFROM XXX\r\nWHERE t >= 1546382757\r\n  AND t <= 1549061157\r\n  AND state = 'FAILED'\r\n  AND eventType = 'complete'\r\nGROUP BY a,\r\n         DATETIMECONVERT(t, \"1:SECONDS:EPOCH\", \"1:SECONDS:EPOCH\", \"1:DAYS\")\r\nTOP 10. \r\n\r\nIt is okay with the \"select a as A\" part but not by the time function in the select clause. ie, I have to rewrite this query like this:\r\n\r\nSELECT a as A,\r\n       count(1) as count\r\nFROM XXX\r\nWHERE t >= 1546382757\r\n  AND t <= 1549061157\r\n  AND state = 'FAILED'\r\n  AND eventType = 'complete'\r\nGROUP BY a,\r\n         DATETIMECONVERT(t, \"1:SECONDS:EPOCH\", \"1:SECONDS:EPOCH\", \"1:DAYS\")\r\nTOP 10. \r\n\r\nBut note that we want the timestamp field to show up as a special column name __timestamp in the visualization, and the group-by cannot take a column alias (ie I cannot do \"group by a, blah as foo\"). \r\n\r\nWhich means that I somehow need to tell the visualization code which column is __timestamp and stamp that in so.\r\n\r\nI could hack this in another way by keeping track of the __timestamp column only and stamping that in, but no matter what I do, I need some way to \"rename\" something in the returned dataframe. \r\n\r\nThe real way to fix this would be to fix this in Pinot itself. Were it not for this parse error, we can have the \"select X as Y\" in the query and then use the moz-sql-parser to get the aliases and stamp them back. But as it stands now, this is not this is not doable :(. (I can work on that on the pinot side that would take a while to get pushed through and I think that some pinot support rather than none is better until then)\r\n\r\nI decided against creating a PQL string that I then reparse and change under the covers before giving it to Pinot: I would like the generated query to be something that the user can take it and directly do a REST query to Pinot and it should work. It shouldn't be a Pinot-QL dialect that is private to Superset. \r\n\r\nThe labels_expected aspect is local to the visualization logic: it expects the dataframe to have the __timestamp column to identify the time dimension. Alternatively, we can enforce that the time column is always the first column or such but that would be a bigger change everywhere. \r\n\r\nNow, as for the Explore to SQL-Lab exporting is concerned: All that will happen here is that the column names in the SQL-lab will show up as different from what the visualization wants them to be. I think that is okay ? The user can always choose not to expose the Pinot database in the SQL-Lab if he finds that annoying. We can say in the docs that the pinot support is experimental and clearly state the issues with the SQL-lab column naming issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review and let me know if you have a suggestion out of this conundrum.\r\n\r\nI removed the hack for the num_metrics_expr and instead am fixing it in the pinot-dbapi in this PR: https://github.com/betodealmeida/pinot-dbapi/pull/5","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459944452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/459968772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5392#issuecomment-459968772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5392","id":459968772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1OTk2ODc3Mg==","user":{"login":"ofajardo","id":17498727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDk4NzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17498727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo","html_url":"https://github.com/ofajardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofajardo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-02T14:19:48Z","updated_at":"2019-02-02T14:19:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just a comment from a confused user: I was trying queries with ORDER BY and they either were failing (Order by is not allowed in sub-queries message) or just getting things out of order.

If the query takes more than that, say 5-15 minutes, it's pretty clear that it's either too big of a workload, or simply the wrong database engine to power data exploration or dashboarding use cases. For the Hive use-case, it'd be reasonable perhaps use Hive in a data pipeline to prepare/summarize the data further and load it in a more interactive database, or use Presto. The timeout setup, from an administrative standpoint, prevents users from shooting themselves in the foot.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to make sure any proxy or load balancer in front of Superset (if any) has longer timeouts setup than Superset itself.

it looks like some the issues are around lingering locks. So either you find the locking processes and kill them, or another option is to schedule downtime, stop all the web servers, and restart the database process prior to running the migration.\r\n\r\nThere are different ways to hack around alembic (the migration toolkit we use). You can tweak the migration code to skip steps and apply them manually with the proper ALTER command. You can also skip migrations by setting the `alembic_version` table to a particular version. Say if the command that is getting stuck is removing a now-unused column, you could just decide that this doesn't matter and move past it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/460857159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/460862375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6618#issuecomment-460862375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6618","id":460862375,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDg2MjM3NQ==","user":{"login":"jaylindquist","id":222699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjY5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist","html_url":"https://github.com/jaylindquist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaylindquist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-06T00:46:30Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T00:46:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@graceguo-supercat

I decided against creating a PQL string that I then reparse and change under the covers before giving it to Pinot: ***I would like the generated query to be something that the user can take it and directly do a REST query to Pinot and it should work***. It shouldn't be a Pinot-QL dialect that is private to Superset. (emphasis mine)\r\n\r\nI see. I think this is a valid design decision. Essentially we need to make a choice:\r\n\r\n1. Do we want to show a query that is being sent to the DB API driver and can run in SQL Lab giving the exact same results; or\r\n2. Do we want to show a query that can be sent to the DB directly without using Superset?\r\n\r\nFor the Google Spreadsheets connector I went with (1), mainly because the user will never send the SQL to Google Spreadsheets since it only support very basic queries and everything else is done through pre and post processors, so it was an easy decision. For Druid (1) and (2) are identical, so no choice needs to be done.\r\n\r\nIdeally the changes should be pushed upstream to Pinot. When I presented the first draft of the Python DB driver they seemed excited and open to improving the SQL parser, so that might be our best option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/460864553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/460874218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6815#issuecomment-460874218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6815","id":460874218,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MDg3NDIxOA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-06T01:52:05Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T23:24:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
