We could use a SynchronousQueue (with fairness) if we want to block for a thread -- probably what we should do. FYI that queue is the default for Executors.newCachedThreadPool(). The \"caller runs\" behavior I meant could be done via an ExecutorService delegate that catches RejectedException and simply runs the Runnable.\r\n\r\n@dsmiley instead of using a rejected tasks execution handler, I went with @noblepaul 's suggestion of having a reasonably large queue for the threadpool (number of threads * 1000). Beyond this, if tasks are submitted, it is okay to reject them.

When you say be another module, do you mean move it to `solr/modules` that needs to be enabled?

Some other ideas that come to mind are `SampleSecurityJson`, `SecurityJsonTestUtils`, `SecurityJsonUtils`, `SecurityJsonConstants`, `SecurityConstants`, `SecurityTestConstants` and so on.  Some of those would mean a longer name for the actual string constant containing the json, for example, if we go with `SecurityConstants` as the class name, we'd need something like `SecurityConstants.SIMPLE_SECURITY_JSON`\r\n\r\nI figured that SecurityJson.SIMPLE was the most concise and someone could further understand the intent by seeing \"util\" in the package name and seeing that it's in the \"test-framework\" tree. If I had to pick one of the other options, I think I'd pick `SecurityJsonConstants`. Let me know if you have a preference or any other suggestions.

Tangentially, I'd like to also support additional query parameters on top of the query string, i.e. the `df` default field param, but I haven't gotten to that yet (you'll notice that `SimpleQueryParser::getParams` method is empty for now). ...\r\n> \r\n> Maybe I'm making a tangential comment here too but I'm wondering about scoping of the integration and if/how perhaps it could be split into phases e.g. an initial integration scope in this pull request and more advanced aspects somewhat considered in the approach here but deferred to later phases otherwise. E.g. additional query parameters and parallelism and aliasing and write-to-doc-list (or not-write-to-doc-list) sound like potentially more-advanced aspects?\r\n\r\nI support whatever will make this more mergeable. Some of these features were added to make the solution more adoptable by current users of lucene-monitor so I was striving for feature parity.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the aliasing feature specifically is fairly important and I'd probably want to make that the default/recommended approach. By aliasing the fields the presearcher creates you guarantee schema compatibility plus you get other benefits like compatibility with multi-pass presearcher.\r\n\r\nHaving said \"having said that\" I'll defer to what you think is best because getting anything merged is a selling point for the viability of this approach. From the feedback I've gotten so far from the other solr committee members it sounds like they want some real users before the maintainability-threshold is reached. On the other hand I've talked to some potential users who were skeptical about using an experimental solr plugin. With a chicken and egg scenario like that, even just talking about merging is great marketing 🙂","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2101745053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2103005840","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2445#issuecomment-2103005840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2445","id":2103005840,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM59WVKQ","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-09T16:30:41Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T16:30:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i think I am coming around to the name...

Loading it once rather than 40 times was pretty important. At a later date I think they converted this to the blob version to upgrade, but I was elsewhere by that time. (Edit: Memory foggy been years...

Separately, I wonder if we make it too easy to loop the state of every collection. I'm looking at `Cluster` added by @murblanc which contains not only an `Iterator<SolrCollection> iterator();` method, but also `Iterable<SolrCollection> collections();` to make it that much easier. Instead, let's just have a method to list collection names. Then if the caller is hell bent on looping everything in the cluster, it's going to be that much more obvious to that code that it's looking up collection info for each and every one.\r\n\r\n`org.apache.solr.cluster.Cluster` is made to present the internal cluster abstraction to plugin writers in order to decouple plugins from the internal implementation (so we can change the abstractions without breaking plugins).\r\n\r\nThe existing internal cluster abstraction does allow listing all collections, as does the Collection API BTW. Instead of shooting the messenger (`org.apache.solr.cluster.Cluster`) we could reconsider if listing all collections in general makes sense. Obviously listing all collections does not scale, but most SolrCloud deployments do not have such scaling issues.\r\n\r\nIf we do think that listing all collections is useful (which you seem to agree to given the proposal to return all names), I'd rather have the API we offer to plugin writers be easy to use. Returning names and forcing the caller to go fetch the collection one by one is not convenient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2117113044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
