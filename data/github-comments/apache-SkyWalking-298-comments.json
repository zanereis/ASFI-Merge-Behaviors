In your case, maybe `ServiceDispatcher.class` and `ServiceDispatcher_1.class` are a better choice. After all, this is not a runtime name.\r\n\r\nIn my case, in the file content, the class name is `ServiceMeshServiceDispatcher`, but the file name is `ServiceDispatcher.class`. I have used `metricsClass.getSimpleName() `to replace the original argument `className` to fix the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1360695522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1361114232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/10189#issuecomment-1361114232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/10189","id":1361114232,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85RIPR4","user":{"login":"naah69","id":25682169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjgyMTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25682169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69","html_url":"https://github.com/naah69","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naah69/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-21T10:09:30Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T10:09:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"i had used filter to deal it.\r\nbut i think it is so ugly.\r\nis there any better way to reslove it ?\r\n<img width=\"746\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25682169/208879417-1727a81d-6025-45db-8ab8-46a0216b5fbf.png\">\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1361114232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/1361116267","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/10189#issuecomment-1361116267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/10189","id":1361116267,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls85RIPxr","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-21T10:11:16Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T10:11:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let's see @BFergerson has any suggestions.\r\n\r\n@naah69 For a community, there is nothing urgent.

I think besides the basic grammar, we could choose these four APIs as MVP\r\n1. Metadata Query API, https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.37/querying/api/#querying-metadata. Metadata has a specific meaning for us. We could expose our metadata metric names(e.g. service_traffic).\r\n   - listMetrics could be considered a kind of metadata if possible(TBD)\r\n2. Metrics value Query API,  https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.37/querying/api/#expression-queries. Metrics as time-series values could be queried and returned in the expected format.\r\n   - When the `range` is missed, we could pick the latest 30 mins\r\n   - We need to recognize and pick dimensions automatically, to avoid `too many data points` error and overload\r\n   - There should be a complete label set to define our scope in order to get metrics correctly. I didn't read Grafana+PromQL Datasource carefully yet, but I hope we have a chance to provide topology, at least topology line metrics.\r\n3. Alerts API, https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.37/querying/api/#alerts. This could directly query our alarms with some pre-defined labels(e.g. rule_name)\r\n4. Build Info, https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/2.37/querying/api/#build-information. This is our version service.\r\n\r\nWith all the implementation, we need to define our details, mostly about specific labels. Complete docs should be added under `APIs/Query APIs/PromQL`\r\n<img width=\"247\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/209427655-76b5969a-27c9-4f3c-ba4f-8f082c5879c3.png\">\r\n \r\n**Notice, we should explicitly declare at the top of the new PromQL API doc. The APIs are built on top of GraphQL APIs, and only provide a feature subset of GraphQL APIs**.\r\n\r\n@wankai123 Please add anything you found on your side.
