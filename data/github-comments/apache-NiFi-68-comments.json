instinct about Compilable is spot-on, it's exactly when I stopped working this branch :P For ExecuteScript, I'd thought such a processor would be for quick onTrigger() implementations, and due to multithread issues with [NIFI-1822](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-1822) (concurrent tasks) with various scripting engines, things might get dicey for Compilable engines.  However this would be an excellent enhancement for InvokeScriptedProcessor (ISP), with the caveat that the engine is also Invocable. I haven't run thru the list of engines thus far (to include Kotlin) to see what that would look like, but I have investigated it and for the sake of generality I left it out of the current code.

I replied separately on data formatting. As for EL, see my comments below.\r\n\r\nI wanted to move towards generating CSV files that can be easily parsed by using the CSV Record Reader. So I exposed the CSVUtils Properties and put them on to this processor.  I was having problems with comma's in my input file before, but after these changes that isn't an issue anymore. I also wanted the code to be easier to maintain, so I tried to move as much of the CSV code to the existing code in the record serializers module. That code, `CSVUtils.createCSVFormat`, does not use EL, which makes sense since it's all being defined on a Controller Service.\r\n\r\nI tried making an Excel Spreadsheet Record Reader, and I did make one, but it did not use streaming. It loaded the whole spreadsheet into memory. I couldn't find a way using the Apache POI project to do stream reading one row at a time (instead of all rows at once).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/335377319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/335377879","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2203#issuecomment-335377879","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2203","id":335377879,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTM3Nzg3OQ==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T06:51:29Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T06:51:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1,

For example, when RouteText is used with a \"Matching Strategy\" of \"Satisfies Expression\", the variables \"line\" and \"lineNo\" are also available in EL to make routing decisions. I think it would be nice for this to be better reflected here as well, such as :\r\n\r\n```\r\n.expressionLanguageSupported(ExpressionLanguageScope.FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES)\r\n.expressionLanguageVariable(\"line\", \"The line of text to evaluate\")\r\n.expressionLanguageVariable(\"lineNo\", \"The 1-based number that represents which line in the incoming FlowFile this line is\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Mock Framework currently will throw an Exception if a Property indicates that EL is supported but does not evaluate the Expression Language (or vice versa). It probably makes sense to update that to also ensure that the proper scope was used (if VARIABLE_REGISTRY is specified but FlowFile attributes are evaluated, that should fail). This could potentially be done as a separate JIRA, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/338658580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/338686210","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2205#issuecomment-338686210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2205","id":338686210,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODY4NjIxMA==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-23T14:55:35Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T14:55:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback @markap14! I'll have a look for variables at processor level (never noticed it to be honest). Regarding the mock framework, I added some changes [here](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2205/files#diff-870890bcfd73493b10d56ae9f7e1d3b1R192).
