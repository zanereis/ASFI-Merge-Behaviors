But it is fine to keep the logic in `RemoteInputChannel` if you make sure, that a recycler puts these buffers right (back) into the buffer queue (I guess, that's in one of the follow-up PRs). This way, we avoid an additional intermediate component (and the need to interact with it). To conclude, on a second thought, it is fine as it is.\r\n\r\nThe thing with `ResultPartitionType` is that without an (intermediate) way to set `isCreditBased` to `true`, we are not really able to test this code path on higher levels such as the `NetworkEnvironment` (or maybe I'll see that in the follow-up PRs as well).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of tests...I understand that with the switch to credit-based flow control, some parts will be covered by existing tests, but we also change the behaviour at some points and the current tests are already a bit sparse. Can you also add tests for\r\n- the `NetworkEnvironment` changes (into `NetworkEnvironmentTest`),\r\n- `NetworkBufferPool#requestMemorySegments`, `NetworkBufferPool#recycleMemorySegments` (into `NetworkBufferPoolTest` which currently is a bit sparse though)\r\n- the changes in `SingleInputGate` (into `SingleInputGateTest`)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/325308474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/325338108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4355#issuecomment-325338108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4355","id":325338108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTMzODEwOA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-28T12:19:34Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T12:19:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @wuchong, \r\n\r\nI think we don't need to call `open()` and `close()` in `AggregateAggFunction`. `GeneratedAggregations` is an internal class which is not exposed to users.
