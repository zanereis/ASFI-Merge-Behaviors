It provides a proxy service (using Flask, a Python web microframework) that implements the required `/init` and `/run` routes to interact with the OpenWhisk invoker service. The implementation of these routes is encapsulated in a class named `ActionRunner` which provides a basic framework for receiving code from an invoker, preparing it for execution, and then running the code when required.\r\n\r\nAn implementation of the runner for Python actions is available [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-python/blob/master/core/pythonAction/pythonrunner.py). \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass PythonRunner(ActionRunner):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n

It's just defined in the OpenWhisk invoker image - see here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/core/invoker/Dockerfile#L8.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, if somebody should use the Docker container factory in an invoker that is not running in a container based on that image, we cannot warrant the variable is defined.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a more robust solution, I suggest to consider using this command to determine the `docker` cli client version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# docker version --format '{{.Client.Version}}'\r\n17.10.0-ce\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis requires more code changes but should be much safer. The version info is required when creating a new Docker container, i.e. in `DockerContainer.create()`. Said method receives a `DockerApiWithFileAccess` instance as implicit parameter so that we can extend the `DockerApi` trait and its implementation to determine the `docker` cli command version. It would be good to make version determination a singleton such that the command only needs to be run once. Otherwise, container creation would get slower.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/452724465/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/452818460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4211#issuecomment-452818460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4211","id":452818460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjgxODQ2MA==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-09T19:07:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T19:07:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I wonder if instead of modifying the Action type, we can add an alias to `FullyQualifiedName`.

The issue here is that sequences aren't allowed parameters (for historical reasons that are no longer applicable). There is a long discussion about sequence parameters - should they be local (visible only to the first action in the sequence) or global (scoped to all actions in the sequence). If we make them local at least we can allow the sequence to protect the parameters of the first action.\r\n\r\nIn short, yes we should fix this. Are you interested in sending a contribution/patch?

In that case, you update the replication control doc instead of creating it.\r\n\r\nWhile it fixes the observed error, it still hides the problem that the replication already exists.\r\n\r\nLet's have a look at the failing test: https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tests/src/test/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/database/test/ReplicatorTests.scala#L350. It performs a cleanup at the end (https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/tests/src/test/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/database/test/ReplicatorTests.scala#L376) - including removal of the replication control doc. Apparently, this cleanup failed in a previous test run such that the replication control doc already exists when the test runs again.\r\n\r\nThe test creates a source DB and a replicator that will create a target DB on the fly and replicate from source to target DB. The test creates a test document in the source DB and checks whether it gets replicated.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what happens when we \"re-use\" an existing replication control doc instead of creating a new one. Will it automatically create the target DB? Probably the test would even pass - but without actually performing a replication...\r\n\r\nI suggest to improve the test's robustness by cleaning up at the test start as well.
