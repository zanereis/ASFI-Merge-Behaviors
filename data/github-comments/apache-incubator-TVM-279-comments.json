Probably Wuwei just reused the part of code, so it's my fault ü§ê:sweat:.\r\n\r\nFrom my POV, the interface was designed like this mainly because `CacheRead` and `CacheWrite` specify the target buffer by a block and a index. Therefore I inherited the interface in `CacheRead` and `CacheWrite`. \r\n\r\nAt that time I thought that \"specifying a buffer directly on the allocation side is impossible\", but after a second thought today... Of course we can do that.\r\n\r\nSo ATM I think specifying the target buffer from the allocation side by `alloc_buffer_index` is much more convenient.

@manupa-arm, thanks for the nice PR!\r\n\r\nAs a main thing I am a little bit worried about, I would love to discuss specifically on the IR-related change, because in the worse case, adding/changing/removing an IR node would result in malfunctioning of many passes. Therefore, we tend to keep the IR stable if possible, and scrutinize any changes to the IR. For example, when @masahi was adding the while node (really awesome work https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7425), we discussed very carefully on the implication, and actually updated many passes that are affected by that particular change.\r\n\r\nAs we are adopting the new RFC process, I would love to propose that if the RFC implies any IR modification, the modification should be written explicitly in a section (e.g. which fields are added), and be discussed really carefully on potential alternatives without IR change, and everything that could happen if the IR is changed (e.g. which passes won't work). CC: @jroesch @vinx13 @areusch @comaniac \r\n\r\nOn this particular case, we are seeing a set of IR changes, including this PR, the [`PrimFunc` PR](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8452), the [`allocate_const` PR](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8472).

In this PR, I only made a safe/harmless change by casting lower-bit `uint` constant value to higher-bit `int`. \r\n\r\nHowever, when we have, say `int32` and `uint32`, the question is that how should we perform casting? i.e., what is the logic of `op(int32(lhs), uint32(rhs))`? In TVM, we will cast all types to a signed integer with maximum bits (regarding the operands). i.e., `op(int32(lhs), int32(uint32(rhs)))`. But here, `int32(uint32(rhs))` is not `IntImm` but `CastNode`... Then your question would be: shall we directly evaluate the `CastNode` during casting (which requires changing the value of `IntImm`).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38074777/129131777-4b4c88db-4c85-4eaa-a4aa-e34fd5995373.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/897311045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/897318076","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7301#issuecomment-897318076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7301","id":897318076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41e_y8","user":{"login":"huajsj","id":2281489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODE0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2281489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj","html_url":"https://github.com/huajsj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huajsj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-12T03:23:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T03:23:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@codgeek , thanks for report this issue, please check if this PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8731 fixed the said issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/897318076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/897326613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8706#issuecomment-897326613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8706","id":897326613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41fB4V","user":{"login":"YuchenJin","id":15164320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0MzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin","html_url":"https://github.com/YuchenJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuchenJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-12T03:47:52Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T03:47:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ganler Thanks for going through the detail!

I agree splitting the `testdata` folder into `kws` and `mnist` makes sense, so I did it. For the project types, `example_project` and `host_driven` are the two types of projects we can instantiate. The `template_project` directory is different, and only exists to hold `microtvm_api_server.py` and its tests. I added a comment about that to `_copy_project_files`, but I'd be open to renaming `template_project` to make that clearer.\r\n\r\nYour comments should be addressed by

Thanks for elaborating on the issue and implementing the fix!\r\n> \r\n> One question is that whether we want to also make `assert tir.const(1, \"uint2\") == tir.const(1, \"int2\")` work? I think since `lhs` and `rhs` have the same bits, `SimpleCast` will be applied to both sides, but the same error throws.\r\n\r\n@YuchenJin For the scenario that unsigned and signed integer have the same width, I think we should consistent with C standard (e.g., \"int32 + uint32\" -> \"uint32(int32) + uint32\") instead of current logic \"int32 + uint32\" -> \"int32 + int32(uint32)\", please have a look of my PR #8733, we implement a new AI chip backend of TVM, now we meet this issue, we need make a pass to change the implicit conversion consistent with C standard. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/898280034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/898282339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8733#issuecomment-898282339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8733","id":898282339,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41irNj","user":{"login":"Johnson9009","id":19802523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODAyNTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19802523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009","html_url":"https://github.com/Johnson9009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Johnson9009/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-13T08:27:34Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T08:27:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR can fix the issue reported at https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/tir-const-1-tir-const-true-throws-valueerror/10667, it do the thing that PR #8706 did passingly.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @YuchenJin @junrushao1994 @ganler Please help to review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/898282339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/898288585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8605#issuecomment-898288585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8605","id":898288585,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM41isvJ","user":{"login":"XHPlus","id":13585124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTg1MTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13585124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus","html_url":"https://github.com/XHPlus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XHPlus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-13T08:39:00Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T15:46:39Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, the CI semes to fail due to the network problem.
