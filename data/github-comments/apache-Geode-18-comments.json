meant to put this in the commit message, but it must've gotten lost when I rebased:\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n* Those getters that return a `List` have been renamed to indicate a plural.\r\n* Much of the \"massaging\" has been documented in the `bindings.xjb` file.  Comments document what other adjustments have been made, at time of writing.\r\n* A more-restrictive xsd has been included in `configurationService.xsd` that removes deprecated items that should not be supported by this new feature.\r\n* Configuration classes have been generated as `Serializable`, as this will be required when the creation commands et al pass configuration objects to instantiate the services they support.\r\n\r\nI have included the `xjc` tasks I used to generate these objects in their respective `gradle` files, as well as the bindings file each task would produce.  These could have future value if this process is repeated, but I could also see the value in keeping our build files from becoming cluttered.\r\n\r\nThis PR does _not_ update or adjust any of the configuration objects in `geode-connectors` or `geode-lucene`.  Those can be addressed in another ticket.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/383755690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/383998916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1839#issuecomment-383998916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1839","id":383998916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Mzk5ODkxNg==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-24T16:37:32Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T16:37:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jhuynh1 this PR was a follow-up to these two commits in https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/1828:\r\n* GEODE-1279: Rename HARegionQueueSizeRegressionTest\r\n* GEODE-5020: Move HARegionQueue system properties to SystemPropertyHelper\r\n\r\nFeel free to make any changes including category changes!
