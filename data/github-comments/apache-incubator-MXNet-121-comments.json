I'll add that.  I like wall-clock for comparing different hyper-parameter settings though because what you really care about is how long it actually takes to get an answer.  It would be awesome to have a GUI checkbox that toggles, but that's actually fairly complicated due to a limitation in bokeh that doesn't let you dynamically swap axis ranges at runtime.\n\n@mli Yes the constructor is too complicated right now.  I'm going to make the LiveLearningCurve instantiate a PandasLogger by default if you don't specify one.  This makes the common case simpler.  If you want multiple live charts, you'll be able to do that more efficiently by sharing a pandaslogger.  I'll push the new proposed interface soon and would love
