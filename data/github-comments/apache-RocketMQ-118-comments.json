RocketMQ uses an eventual-consistency strategy when managing resources to achieve better performance. Specific and detailed operation steps are necessary for a reliable analysis.\r\n\r\n1. Pause all java applications (nodes involving mq operations)\r\n2. Pause all mq nodes (including namserver), console\r\n3. Delete the rocketmq store directory, rocketmqlogs directory, and data directory (specified by the storePathRootDir property)\r\n4. Delete all rocketmq directories in the consumer\r\n5. Restart the rocketmq node and start the console\r\n6. Log in to the console, rely on the add/update button in the topic menu item, and manually create a topic, as shown in the following figure:\r\n![1660120530293](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2167809/183856345-cd4ffb0f-602b-4abe-9ba7-2c10624d68fe.jpg)\r\n\r\n7. After creating all topics in turn, start all applications.\r\n8. Manually test a small amount of data to send and consume offsets are normal. A few days after the business is put into use normally, when the production and consumption of a topic increases to 5-6 times the daily amount, one or more broker consumption queues will have negative offset values.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1210351790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1210387770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4806#issuecomment-1210387770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4806","id":1210387770,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85IJQ06","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-10T09:10:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T02:07:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fujian-zfj Good catch!

If the IP changes, there will be problems. So we hope to have a uuid property that can identify the broker and does not require user configuration. It will also be initialized (if not)  when the broker starts and be persisted to the store directory. After that, the identity of the broker will be changed from IP to persistent uuid.\r\n\r\nHowever, after your reminder, we have come up with another solution. If we persist the controllerBrokerId allocated by the controller according to the IP to the local storage of the broker when the first apply, and bring the controllerBrokerId with each request later, it seems that we can also solve the issue of IP change. For the current implementation, such changes will be slightly larger.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we prefer the second solution.
