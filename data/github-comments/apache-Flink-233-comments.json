for checking this out!\r\n\r\nConcerning the removed `flink-clients` dependency - that was done on purpose. Here is my motivation for that:\r\n  - For the 'provided' API dependency, it should actually not be there.\r\n  - It mainly matters to the in-Eclipse execution, which needs a 'provided' runtime.\r\n  - I would prefer to remove it now, because the dependencies probably change anyways in the future.\r\n\r\nThe proposal I want to make for the next Flink version is to have something like `flink-all` (or `flink-base`) which exactly refers to what is in the `flink-dist` jar (and `flink-dist` draws its jar from there). We set that as a provided dependency anywhere (connector, library, quickstart), we have exactly everything provided that will available through Flink's runtime, and nothing that will not be there. Easiest way to keep these things in sync.\r\n\r\nNow I am unsure if `flink-dist` can currently take a `flink-all` like role, because it declares a lot of additional provided dependencies, for the sake of putting them into `opt` or `examples`. Now, according to the maven dependency management, a transitive provided dependency of a provided dependency is not propagated (in which case it would be okay to use flink-dist), but I am not sure we want to rely that across maven command line, IntelliJ and Eclipse, etc.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence incidentally just made me realize that I should probably change the `flink-dist` dependency in the IDEA profile to `flink-streaming-java` / `flink-clients` for exactly that reason... \r\n**(UPDATE: Adjusted the profiles)**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/368122883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/368221212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5327#issuecomment-368221212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5327","id":368221212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODIyMTIxMg==","user":{"login":"hequn8128","id":4971479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128","html_url":"https://github.com/hequn8128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-24T11:16:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-24T11:16:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi,

We should not add more `public` methods to `ClusterClient`. Implementing `getAccumulators()` in `RestClusterClient` is enough. \r\n\r\nRegarding the `JobAccumulatorsHandler`, what would speak against adding a new field to `UserTaskAccumulator` which stores the `SerializedValue`? The JSON representation would always carry an additional base64 encoded `byte` array but I think performance isn't important at this point.\r\n\r\ncc: @tillrohrmann @aljoscha ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/368506627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/368511857","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5580#issuecomment-368511857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5580","id":368511857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODUxMTg1Nw==","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-26T13:58:54Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T13:58:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"R: @aljoscha ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/368511857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/368525597","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5573#issuecomment-368525597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5573","id":368525597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODUyNTU5Nw==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-26T14:44:53Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T14:44:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@GJL , the before discussion between I and @aljoscha treat the accumulators as a whole (maybe only me?).
