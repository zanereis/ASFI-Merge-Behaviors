However, this was always a transient increase, and by the time couch started throwing 500 errors they were both back at zero. I never saw `couch_server` increase at all. FWIW, I will post the `_system` node response after couch crashes at the bottom of this response.\r\n\r\nNext, I ran with the `update_lru_on_read = false` option set in my `local.ini`. This seemed to trigger the error more quickly. Before adding the option, couchDB would take about 24-26 iterations of my parallel replication script before crashing; after, it only took 4. This was consistent across multiple trials.\r\n\r\n### `_system` node response with `update_lru_on_read` not set\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"uptime\": 228,\r\n  \"memory\": {\r\n    \"other\":

version of CouchDB, is it 2.0.0, 2.1.1 or other\r\n\r\n * What is the size distribution of your documents (average, what are the largest ones)\r\n\r\n * What are the attachment sizes, what is their distribution (average, largest)\r\n\r\n* Are the databases which failed to replicate enough the ones with attachments? Do you have any that don't have attachments and those replicated fast enough?\r\n\r\n* If you can attach the contents of these config sections (but sanitize them to not contain database paths, username and other such things): `couchdb`, `replicator`, `chttpd` and `cluster`. It's easy to get those via the node local port (5986 one) and the _config section:\r\n\r\nHere is an example of my config from the `replicator` section (jq part is the json pretty printer)\r\n```\r\ncurl -s http://<adminuser>:<adminpas>@localhost:15986/_config/replicator | jq '.'\r\n{\r\n  \"startup_jitter\": \"5000\",\r\n  \"connection_timeout\": \"30000\",\r\n  \"max_churn\": \"20\",\r\n  \"interval\": \"60000\",\r\n  \"retries_per_request\": \"5\",\r\n  \"max_jobs\": \"500\",\r\n  \"verify_ssl_certificates\": \"false\",\r\n  \"http_connections\": \"20\",\r\n  \"ssl_certificate_max_depth\": \"3\",\r\n  \"socket_options\": \"[{keepalive, true}, {nodelay, false}]\",\r\n  \"worker_processes\": \"4\",\r\n  \"worker_batch_size\": \"500\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/360167959/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/360202163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/901#issuecomment-360202163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/901","id":360202163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDIwMjE2Mw==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-24T17:01:28Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T17:01:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The issue is open, so it has not been resolved, that is correct.

that is unfortunate. Perhaps disk latency is playing a role in all of this.

In 2.x replicator doesn't use hearbeats, instead it uses timeouts\r\n\r\nI didn't know heartbeats were removed. It shouldn't really matter for my case though. The only reason I'm specifying a heartbeat in my tests is to make the result more visual (so you don't have to wait ten seconds using 1.6 to see if something is happening). \r\n\r\nI have adjusted my test.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# We create our test database\r\ncurl -X PUT localhost:5984/replication-source\r\n\r\n# We insert a design doc with a filter function that is guaranteed to take long\r\n# The reason is so we can simulate a database with a lot of documents which are\r\n# not going to pass in the filtering process.\r\ncurl -X PUT localhost:5984/replication-source/_design/test -d '{\"filters\":{\"test\":\"function(){var future = Date.now() + 2000; while(Date.now() < future){}; return false}\"}}'\r\n\r\n# We insert a bunch of documents so that filtering them will take time. Note\r\n# that I increased the number from 20 to 100, because I have more CPU cores\r\n# this time around (I didn't consider that before).\r\nfor i in {1..100}; do curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:5984/replication-source -d '{\"foo\":\"bar\"}'; done\r\n```\r\n```sh\r\n# I send a request for changes to the database. This request resembles the request\r\n# a replication client might send very closely.\r\ncurl 'localhost:5984/replication-source/_changes?feed=normal&style=all_docs&since=0&filter=test%2Ftest&timeout=10000'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm getting better results now. I do indeed see the `{\"results\":[`-line printed after about ten seconds, followed by a periodic newline, until finally the last sequence number. Unfortunately, this is not what's happening on the production environment, but these results are a huge step forward! Thank you.\r\n\r\n> To double check, is the replication itself running on a 2.x cluster? What are the versions of the targets and source? Are they all 2.x as well?\r\n\r\nThere is one \"central server\" to which, and from which, a large number of clients push and pull subsets of information. The server runs a 2.x cluster, and the clients are single-node CouchDB instances ranging between version 1.6 on Windows XP and 2.x on Windows 10.\r\n\r\n> Are there any proxies or load balancers involved and do you think they could affect the connections?\r\n\r\nThe central server sits behind an nginx reverse proxy, which is now my prime suspect. Thank you for pointing this out to me.\r\n\r\n> How many replication jobs are running?\r\n\r\nThere are a few replication jobs running within the central server itself, but they do not cause problems. At any given time, some fifty clients running their own replication jobs will be polling the server for changes.\r\n\r\n> In case of filtered replications, with large source db and a restrictive filter, like you have, replications won't checkpoint unless they receive a document update via the filter. However if it takes too long and the job is swapped out by the scheduler, it might not have chance to checkpoint, it will be stopped. Next time starts will use 0 for the changes feed start 0, and it will wait again, not get a document, will be stopped, etc.\r\n\r\nThis sounds a lot like what I thought was happening, but every node only runs two replication jobs. One for upstream replication, and one for downstream. Neither are continuous.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI will be investigating whether nginx might be buffering the response before sending it along, causing connections to drop.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/360500296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/360502226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1126#issuecomment-360502226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1126","id":360502226,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDUwMjIyNg==","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T15:33:35Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T15:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good.
