the idea is to add operations as we need and make it easier to do so. \n- Currently, there is a PythonOp that allows you to directly write operator in python(i.e. all numpy).\n- More optimized operator can be added from c++ side, using mshadow, with no knowledge of GPU programming.\n\nSo either you can quickly hack up what you need using numpy, or add important ops in c++ as we need to add them(open up issues on what we want and we can discuss how it can be added)\n\nWe are also continuing to enhance the interface to make adding new operations easier than the current way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/154771579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/154772588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/512#issuecomment-154772588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/512","id":154772588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDc3MjU4OA==","user":{"login":"zcyang","id":5890073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTAwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5890073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang","html_url":"https://github.com/zcyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zcyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-08T03:11:25Z","updated_at":"2015-11-08T03:11:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"May
