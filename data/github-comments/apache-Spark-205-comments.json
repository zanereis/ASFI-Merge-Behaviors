correct me if I am wrong. \n\nThe problem here is that the broadcastedConf is in per task HadoopRDD, synchronized on the method or on the broadcastedConf itself is good within this task. while when you call braodcastedConf.value.value, you actually return the value saved in the memory store,( when memory is enough and with deserialize approaching) this conf object should be the same one per Executor? say when getconf across task, you don't prevent to get the same conf object. and pass this conf object to JobConf(conf) lead to this problem.\n\nIf I am right, then, broadcastedConf.value.value.synchronized might solve this problem? \n\nI am not 100% sure those reference across task staffs did work as I described above. What do you think about it? I will try to modify the code and see if it works, If this is true, I can do a quick pull request

Just checked Matlab’s svd and svds. I don’t remember I have used options.{tol, maxit} before. I wonder whether this is useful to expose to users. I did use RCOND before because I needed to compute very accurate solution. But that work was purely academic. In MLlib’s implementation, we take the A^T A approach, which couldn’t give us very accurate small singular values if the matrix is ill-conditioned. So this is not useful either. My suggestion for the type signature is simply:\n\n```\ndef computeSVD(k: Int, computeU: Boolean)\n```\n\nLet’s estimate the complexity of the dense approach and the iterative approach and decide which to use internally. We can open advanced options later, e.g. rcond, iter, method: {\"dense\", \"arpack\"}, etc. What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47681084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47683286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1110#issuecomment-47683286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1110","id":47683286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NjgzMjg2","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-01T17:08:48Z","updated_at":"2014-07-01T17:11:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We benchmarked treeReduce in our random forest implementation, and since the trees generated from each partition are fairly large (more than 100MB), we found that treeReduce can significantly reduce the shuffle time from 6mins to 2mins.

change seems reasonable because on large clusters, we occasionally see a single disk on a single machine is failed, and this may cause the entire application to crash because the executor will keep getting restarted until the Master kills the application.\n\nIt also allows a more uniform configuration for a heterogeneous cluster with different numbers of disks.\n\nThe downside of this behavioral change is that a misconfiguration like mistyping one of your local dirs may go unnoticed for a while, but this will hopefully become apparent after a `df` or a look at any of the executor logs. The fail-fast approach is generally better, but current Spark does not do a good job communicating the reason for executors that crash immediately upon startup.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47690237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/47694608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1277#issuecomment-47694608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1277","id":47694608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Njk0NjA4","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-01T18:45:43Z","updated_at":"2014-07-01T18:45:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"

Keeping API simple might be more important than flexibility. I think tol can be set to a default value (e.g. 1e-10, which is the default in matlab). But maxit is related to k, 300 would be enough for most cases, or max(300, k*2) if k is large. For the naming, how about computeTruncatedSVD? (I saw this term used in many papers, also in my thesis). or computeSVDs (like svds in matlab)?\n\nI think separating svd and svds in two functions is better than deciding dense/sparse impl internally for the user. It's hard to enumerate all use cases and decide an impl logic.
