someone still interested in this change? Again it has been more then 3 weeks since opening this pull request and I fixed all comments that were given. Since I touch a lot of files it will get harder to rebase this again the longer it takes. \nIf this change is not interesting for you I can close it, just tell me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/97328336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/97351925","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/636#issuecomment-97351925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/636","id":97351925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3MzUxOTI1","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T08:32:35Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T08:32:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for reviewing @chiwanpark.

At the moment this happens sequentially, meaning that for each `IntermediateResultPartition` a message is sent to the TM and then the response is awaited. Only after receiving the response of this TM, the next `IntermediateResultPartition` is processed. This can considerably slow down the scheduling if the degree of parallelism is high. I think we should make use of Akka's future composition to do that concurrently.\n\nFurthermore, we could think about doing the backtracking in parallel.

like the interfaces, they are quite precise. To sum up (and see if I get this right), with `Checkpointed` we simply guarantee that an operator will not get invoked while state is persisted unless it implements `CheckpointedAsynchronously`. In that case the operator should instead send a copy of its state.\n\nRegarding reconfiguration with arbitrary partitioning, a scheme that comes into my mind right now is to let functions to lazily request state on demand (without priorly injecting it) when they need to access it since we can't possible preallocate it. The first time they will try to access specific keys for example, only the associated state with these keys will be retrieved from the persistent recovery checkpoint. This way we let the reconfigured partitioners to decide on how state will be eventually allocated to instances.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/98757999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/98760015","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/643#issuecomment-98760015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/643","id":98760015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4NzYwMDE1","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-04T15:45:12Z","updated_at":"2015-05-04T15:45:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Concerning synchronous/asynchronous checkpointing, you are right.

If that's the case however, it's not quite clear to me how this will play along with the configuration option setting.\n\nBack to my previous comment on only accessing the degrees inside the update/messaging functions instead of adding public methods to the Vertex class, a simple way to do this would be the following:\nAdd set/get vertexDegree methods in `VertexUpdateFunction` and `MessagingFunction`. These would be the methods that the user will call to access the vertex degrees, in a way similar to `getDirection()`, `getBroadcastSet()` etc.\nInside `createResultVerticesWithDegrees`, you're already creating the \"augmented\" vertex dataset with the degrees and pass this as the solution set of the delta iteration. Then, in the corresponding coGroup method of the Messaging/VertexUpdate UDFs, you iterate over this dataset (state) and call the user-defined functions for each vertex. This is where you can set the degrees inside the update/messaging functions, instead of how you currently set them on the vertex object.\n\nWhat do you think of this solution?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/99070508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/99073001","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/643#issuecomment-99073001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/643","id":99073001,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MDczMDAx","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T13:05:15Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T13:05:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, my bad, I confused the layers.\n\nThese interfaces do not sufficiently describe things for incremental checkpointing.
