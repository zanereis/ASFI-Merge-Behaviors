Then created a site2site VPN between them. Both VMs can now reach each other over their internal ip addresses (source code link mentioned above). This was done on both KVM and XenServer. \n\nNote: if you test on KVM, please build agent rpm packages from this brancha nd install them prior to adding the KVM hypervisor. Hint: `cd packaging` and then `./package.sh -d {dist}`\n\nWhile Travis and Apache Jenkins do another build, we'll run some extra Marvin tests.\n\nPinging @wilderrodrigues @borisroman to do their final reviews.

Below the tests I executed manually and via Marvin. It all looks fine!\n\nHowever, there is still 1 thing that nobody noticed - because they don't test - which concerns the Redundant VPC routers: we cannot ssh into VM in a rVPC, unfortunately!\n\n@isoutham wrote a nice test for that (component/test_vpc_redundnat.py) which was working really fine. Unfortunately I tried it now and also some manual tests, but the rVPC no longer works.\n\nI will create an issue for that and try to get it fixed.\n\nI would like to suggest that for any router related changes the following tests are _always_ executed:\n- component/test_vpc_redundant.py  - hardware=true\n  - Feature currently broken - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-8915\n- component/test_routers_iptables_default_policy.py  - hardware=true\n- component/test_vpc_router_nics.py - hardware=true\n- smoke/test_network_acl.py - hardware=true\n- component/test_vpc_offerings.py - hardware=false\n- component/test_vpc_routers.py - hardware=false\n- smoke/test_routers.py - hardware=false\n- smoke/test_privategw_acl.py - hardware=false\n- smoke/test_reset_vm_on_reboot.py - hardware=false\n- smoke/test_vm_life_cycle.py - hardware=false\n- smoke/test_vpc_vpn.py - hardware=false\n- smoke/test_service_offerings.py - hardware=false\n\nThe PR 887 LATM - Look AWESOME to Me! :100:  :+1: \n\nCheers,\nWilder \n\nP.S.: I already executed all tests below, but I will continue for a bit more and will edit the PR comment later.

If not running then error is thrown. Based on the present implementation of the VR rules, we should skip the STOPPED/STOPPING VR's as the rules get applied to them after they get restarted. \n\nTo check rules are applied(VPN in this case), ssh to the NOW running VR and look into the /usr/share/ppp/chap-secrets file.
