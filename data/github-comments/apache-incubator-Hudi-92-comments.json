I find that when reading a hudi table which has updated twice more using spark sql, the query result is incorrect with many duplicate records. \r\nAfter debugging, I found out that the reason is that it miss some table properties and serde property in the hive table with `HiveSyncTool`. Spark sql just treat the table as a hive table, but not a hudi datasource table.And finally, spark sql read the hudi table as a normal parquet table, which lead to the duplicate records in query result.\r\n I fix this issue by add the missing table properites and serde properties to the hive table.The missing table properties are here:\r\n`spark.sql.sources.provider= 'hudi'\r\nspark.sql.sources.schema.numParts = 'xx'\r\nspark.sql.sources.schema.part.{num} ='xx'\r\nspark.sql.sources.schema.numPartCols = 'xx'\r\nspark.sql.sources.schema.partCol.{num} = 'xx'`\r\nand the missing serde properties is: `'path'='/path/to/hudi'`\r\nWith this fix, the spark sql can read the hudi table in hive meta correctly Now.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/739497762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/739499488","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2297#issuecomment-739499488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2297","id":739499488,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTQ5OTQ4OA==","user":{"login":"pengzhiwei2018","id":42458891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDU4ODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42458891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018","html_url":"https://github.com/pengzhiwei2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pengzhiwei2018/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-06T13:00:28Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T13:04:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @bithw1 , are you query the data with hive sql or spark sql.

By this way, callers of combineAndGetUpdateValue don't need to pass around the properties. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/741600626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/741602312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2250#issuecomment-741602312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2250","id":741602312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTYwMjMxMg==","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T07:58:42Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T07:58:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Made https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2312 to include changes in Exporter too.
