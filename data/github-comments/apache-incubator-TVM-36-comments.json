Please suggest if i need to update further. \r\n\r\n> As for the tensor storage format, one way we might be able to do is to provide a base64 serialization format of the tensor, so that can be embedded into json, would that be helpful?\r\n\r\nif we add the storage in tensor along with the graph dump, the file will become so big for big networks. When i checked tensorflow/mxboard they are also creating separate files for tensors. Another thing is graph wont change. but tensors can keep changing based on input data. So if user run graph again and again with different inputs, we need to update the complete graph dump file. numpy dumping format is easy and wont consume much memory. tensorboard, curses can directly load the numpy format without any

I understand that the OpenCL specs are similar between the two vendors, and that there exist analogous code pragmas between the two specs which can be generated depending on the target we're in.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is to merge common infrastructure as much as possible early on rather than later.

For example, Intel OpenCL uses global variables to represent FIFOs between modules and a module is generated from a kernel function with `__kernel` OpenCL identifier. On the other hand, Xilinx HLS C uses their built-in data structure to explicitly specify FIFOs. As a result, even both code generators use the same lowered IR, the implementation of each generator may still be very different.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409008800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409013363","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1474#issuecomment-409013363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1474","id":409013363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTAxMzM2Mw==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-30T21:16:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-30T21:16:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@comaniac that's a good point regarding hardware constructs such as FIFOs. \r\n\r\nAs a result the conclusion of this discussion is to re-use IR passes for schedule lowering purposes between the different vendors, and have specialized code generators for each vendor to convert lowered TVM IR into OpenCL code.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you agree with this approach.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409013363/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409083543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1487#issuecomment-409083543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1487","id":409083543,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTA4MzU0Mw==","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-31T03:34:38Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T03:34:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the review.

Please take another review to see whether current PR is suitable for a merge.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, as suggested by @tqchen , we would port current implementation to real neural networks. I've create [a experimental repo](https://github.com/liangfu/mxnet-sparse-mlp) and trained a sparse mlp. The dense operator proposed in this PR can be used to perform inference in the sparse mlp.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409498785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409576410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1519#issuecomment-409576410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1519","id":409576410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTU3NjQxMA==","user":{"login":"qingyuanxingsi","id":1770516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1770516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi","html_url":"https://github.com/qingyuanxingsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qingyuanxingsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T13:34:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T13:37:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen I have added a question [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/how-to-make-module-so-static-link-glibc/124/3), but nobody answers after 8 days~~TVM provides an elegant alternative for deploying deep models, but the docs are not quite user friendly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409576410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/409591646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1487#issuecomment-409591646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1487","id":409591646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTU5MTY0Ng==","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T14:19:41Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T14:19:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am doing some refactor.
