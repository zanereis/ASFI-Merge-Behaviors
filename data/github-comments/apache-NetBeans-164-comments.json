where do you see this performance issue? in NB 18rc or in 12.1?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there are two bugs in play here.  I believe the application being built is based on 12.1, so why the infinite loop happens, and was fixed in 4130.  But even building the example against the current platform leads to multiple queues being created that are never cleared up.\r\n\r\nSetting `javac.fork=true` in the project properties of the individual module seems to stop most of the additional queues being created in the JVM of the IDE, except for the parsing one.  I think this is caused by use of a weak file listener in the annotation processor, along with some classloading tricks going on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1531638105/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1531942917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5909#issuecomment-1531942917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5909","id":1531942917,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5bT5gF","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-02T18:22:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-02T18:22:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"For a medium sized project the avg mem consumption went from 500-800MB down to 350 on my machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1531942917/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1532000744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5909#issuecomment-1532000744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5909","id":1532000744,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5bUHno","user":{"login":"MartinBalin","id":26064232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDY0MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26064232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin","html_url":"https://github.com/MartinBalin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartinBalin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-02T19:04:05Z","updated_at":"2023-05-02T19:04:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Perfect, this can help in VSCode use case when VSNetBeans is one of LangServers running in background on user machine.
