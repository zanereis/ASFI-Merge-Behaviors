Essentially what we want this PR to achieve is to minimize the server shift when picking servers from the candidate servers. \r\n\r\n+1. The intention was to indeed keep them separate and only solve the specific problem in this PR. The assumption of an entire replica group fitting into a pool will be violated in FD aware instance assignment but let's deal with it as part of the latter implementation (in-progress).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, let's also not worry about adding / removing pool in this PR and add that as a TODO ?\r\n\r\nLastly, regarding making this stateful v/s stateless -- I had the same question earlier in this PR https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8441#discussion_r839050322 primarily because of Znode size but in offline discussion with @jackjlli  I got convinced otherwise that it is not possible and wasn't aware pool selection is

But IMO storing RG -> pool mapping is still not enough, take the following case as an example of a different assignment strategy not requiring 1:N pool to replica mapping:\r\n> > 24 instances in 5 pools, with [5,5,5,4,5] servers in each pool, ie [s0-s4, s5-s9, s10-s14, s15-18, s19-s23] we want to assign this 21 instances to 3 RGs, a instance selection strategy gives: RG0: [s0-s7] RG1: [s8-s15] RG2: [s16-s23]\r\n> > this yields a RG->pool mapping of: RG0 -> pool0, pool1 RG2 -> pool1, pool2, pool3 RG3 -> pool3, pool4\r\n> > taking out 1 instances s6(poo1), s11(pool2), and s21(pool4), it will be [5,4,4,4,4] severs in each pool and [7, 7, 7] servers in each RG. Then for InstanceTagPoolSelector/PartitionSelector it would be very hard to figure out (1) to which pool the lost instances belong to (2) where the vacant seats in the each pool\r\n> \r\n> I assume this is for the fault domain assignment which is not yet supported. Handling this scenario with the constrain of fault domain (no server cross replicas in the same fault domain) can be quite hard, and the current implementation won't cover that as well.\r\n> \r\n> I wouldn't mix the problem this PR is trying to solve with the fault domain support. Essentially what we want this PR to achieve is to minimize the server shift when picking servers from the candidate servers. That should be handled within the server selection step. Even with fault domain assignment introduced, when the fault domain pool selection algorithm is deterministic, the simple algorithm should give good enough result (when one server is replaced, worst case we need to shift segments from one existing server to another if it is assigned to a different replica group), instead of the worst case of shifting all segments from all servers currently.\r\n> \r\n> In general, we should not try to solve the server selection problem in the pool selection step because that will introduce dependency among different steps, and cause them not to work with other algorithms.\r\n\r\n+1 implementing rebalance in `InstanceReplicaGroupPartitionConfig` for FD awareness rebalance/uplift design. The rebalance code should be aware of the logic of initial instance assignment. I'm okay with separating this function into the FD awareness rebalance PR, we can discuss the details in that one later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1089072738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1089073481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8462#issuecomment-1089073481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8462","id":1089073481,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5A6fFJ","user":{"login":"noon-stripe","id":89272166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjcyMTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89272166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/noon-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noon-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-05T17:18:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T17:18:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@snleee Great comment! I agree that we should work towards depreciating the existing feature and move all codepaths to use the new version of the feature. \r\n\r\nI'm going to comment on the issue to add the depreciation as \"future work,\" but I like that the previous behavior is exactly the same as before for now. One important difference is that the DataType is preserved in the prior version. There are use cases where this might be important and I'd like to think more about how to best address this. \r\n\r\nLet me know if this all sounds good to you.

In your example, since we already know the data type of the sub-field, we should extract it as a separate field to get better performance and be able to configure all indexes. We may add some helper config to make the sub-field extraction more smooth (#7863), but IMO we don't need to support all index types within the `JSON_MATCH`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1090818377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1090935526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8481#issuecomment-1090935526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/8481","id":1090935526,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5BBlrm","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-06T23:52:39Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T01:27:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8481?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#8481](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/pull/8481?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (3a9ad83) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/2d22c6d12ceab2e50de0db72510de47fb2c6ae48?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (2d22c6d) will **increase** coverage by `0.46%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff              @@\n##             master    #8481      +/-   ##\n============================================\n+ Coverage     63.56%   64.03%   +0.46%     \n- Complexity     4198     4309     +111     \n============================================\n  Files          1652     1644       -8     \n  Lines         86988    86520     -468     \n  Branches      13189    13183       -6     \n============================================\n+ Hits          55298    55402     +104     \n+ Misses        27645    27100     -545     \n+ Partials       4045     4018      -27     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| integration1 | `?` | |\n| integration2 | `?` | |\n| unittests1 | `67.05% <ø> (+<0.01%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| unittests2 | `14.12% <ø> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
