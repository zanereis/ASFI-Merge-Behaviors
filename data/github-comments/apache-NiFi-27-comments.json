Here is a sequence of commands that might work:\n\ngit checkout -b add_escape_utils\ngit fetch upstream master\ngit reset --hard upstream/master\ngit cherry-pick 2a4f1bd68a17d3fc765a9d6c8a4e48ef21c77bfe\ngit cherry-pick 37651b83bca350dd3c50da16e6b4eee0f2768a7f\ngit cherry-pick b3fbe7540ffa47905bbbfa172ca08da40387cc58\ngit cherry-pick 4e6a0d57958a3575b1bfd7647538aaf61b28c712\ngit cherry-pick fd63fe95eaadb31209bf245e393e60d0030dbb88\n\nIf you want to push this new branch, you'd need a new PR (this PR is against your master branch). Otherwise (for now) you could update your own master branch to look like this new one:\n\ngit checkout master\ngit reset --hard add_escape_utils\ngit push -f origin master\n\nThat would update this PR. For future contributions you may want to create a new branch off upstream/master and do your development there, it makes rebasing a lot easier. For example, in your local master, every time you do a \"git pull upstream master\" you will get a merge commit (like you see in this branch/PR).\n\nIf something gets messed up and (god forbid) you don't have your commits after any of this, I took the liberty of doing the above and pushing to my fork: https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi/tree/add_escape_utils\n\nLooking forward to having this contribution in NiFi, thanks again!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/239009886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/239011766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/777#issuecomment-239011766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/777","id":239011766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTAxMTc2Ng==","user":{"login":"devin-fisher","id":578233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODIzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher","html_url":"https://github.com/devin-fisher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devin-fisher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-10T21:34:02Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T21:34:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, I'll try that.

Also you may want to check out this documentation on how to re-write history in Git[1]. If you get too messed up you can always use \"reflog\" to rewind. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nAlso I didn't realize I needed to explicitly create a dashboard, I thought it would at least show a notification that I connected (especially when using HTTP).

This just means that you start differing from what origin/master has X commits ago and there are Y more commits beyond that point in origin/master.\n\nSo you will do \"git reset HEAD~X\" where X is the number of commits you are ahead. This will bring you back to a common point with origin/master but leave the changes that were made as unstaged/uncommitted changes.\n\nAfter performing the steps you should be at a point where it says (when running \"git status\") \"you are 1 commit ahead of master\". This 1 commit should have all the changes you made for the Datadog implementation (and only those changes).\n\nThe \"reflog\" is a history of all the git commands you do.

solely on the fact their absence will cause issues to the clients sending emails/flows via this interface. \n\nAs the processor currently lacks the ability to provide the appropriate SMTP reply codes back to the connecting clients, both ListenSMTP and connecting MTAs will waste resource every time a a connection times out (I am not 100% sure how the size issue will unfold). \n\nPostfix

Thank you a lot for detailed explanation. But unfortunately i still face problems while doing that, so i'll describe what i'm doing step-by-step.\n\n1) I'm on master. Do `git fetch --all`. Then `git status` says \n\n> Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\n> nothing to commit, working directory clean\n\n2) I do `git checkout -b ramizjon_datadog`. Switched to new branch.\n3) When i do `git show HEAD~8` i see \"added datadog bundle\" commit message. Well, this is my first commit.\n4) Do `git reset --soft HEAD~8`. `git status` shows me hundreds of files.\n5) I do `git reset` to unstage all the files. \n6) I add all my files(that i've ever created or modified) via `git add <filename>`.\n7) I do `git commit -m \"squashing commits\"`.\n8) As you've recommended i do `git reset HEAD --hard` to get rid of changes i don't want to commit. I see \n\n> HEAD is now at da9ceac squashing commits\n\n9) I do `git rebase origin/master`. And see \n\n> error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:\n> ....\n\n10) Ok, i add all files to index.\n11) I do `git rebase origin/master` again. I see some messages with content like this.\n\n> CONFLICT (rename/delete): nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ambari-bundle/nifi-ambari-reporting-task/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/reporting/ambari/api/MetricBuilder.java deleted in squashing commits and renamed in HEAD. Version HEAD of nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-ambari-bundle/nifi-ambari-reporting-task/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/reporting/ambari/api/MetricBuilder.java left in tree.\n> error: Failed to merge in the changes.\n> Patch failed at 0001 squashing commits\n\nAt this step i realize that something went wrong.

We could just tell them to only pay attention to its Properties interface but then they lose the static key name references and the convenience method calls.\n\nThe transitive dependency weight becomes even more problematic when we have additional providers beyond bouncycastle.\n\nPerhaps we should consider ditching the static getInstance mechanism is NiFiProperties and instead have that class constructed at specific and appropriate entry points in the project.  The constructed instance would have populated plain text values for all properties sensitive or otherwise.  It could offer either an object model for properties which accounts for their key, value, and whether they're sensitive or not - OR - it could simply provide a method allowing the caller to ask if a given property was sensitive or not.  That said, I'm not sure why or if we'd want to expose whether a property was sensitive or not.  I could see it being useful we want to have callers know they better not store the value in a log file or exception message.\n\nThe ProcessContext (processors), Reporting Context (reporting tasks), and ConfigurtaionContext (controller services) each make sense for adding a 'getApplicationProperties()' method which returns the NiFiProperties.  This properties object would externalize any crypto libraries so that this dependency (nifi-properties) remains pure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/239726792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/239794470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/843#issuecomment-239794470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/843","id":239794470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTc5NDQ3MA==","user":{"login":"YolandaMDavis","id":1371858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzE4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1371858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis","html_url":"https://github.com/YolandaMDavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T12:53:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T12:53:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende thanks for the updates and comments on working directory.
