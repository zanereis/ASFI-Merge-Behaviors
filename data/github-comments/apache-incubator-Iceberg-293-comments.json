The relevant code is here: https://github.com/apache/avro/blob/main/lang/java/avro/src/main/java/org/apache/avro/io/BinaryDecoder.java#L398-L424\r\n\r\nIt will speed up the reading tremendously when we don't need to read in the `map[int, bytes]` that we use to store statistics. This way you can jump right over them without having to skip each key-value individually.\r\n\r\n> Question. Aren't we using DataFileWriter from Avro in our AvroFileAppender? If so, how is this PR affecting it? Won't we still use direct encoders there?\r\n\r\nThis is a good question.

So, the problem is shortly described in the linked issue: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/9025 \r\nI am not directly creating `SerializableTable` instance in my code, this is what Spark does (and most likely some other query engines) when reading an Iceberg table. Let me explain the problem in a detailed way.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n1. Let's assume that there is a new implementation of a custom location provider `CustomLocationProvider` packaged into a custom-provider.jar package.\r\n1. There is a Spark job that creates a new Iceberg table `iceberg_table_with_custom_location_provider` with custom location provider by setting `write.location-provider.impl` property on that table. The job provides an implementation of this provider (by using `--jars custom-provider.jar` option) and successfully writes new records into that table.\r\n2. Now a data analyst wants to query this table. She starts `spark-sql` and tries to execute a query `SELECT * FROM iceberg_table_with_custom_location_provider LIMIT 10`. She does not provide the implementation of location provider that was set and used for this table. She is unable to get query results because of the error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to find a constructor for implementation org.iceberg.custom.LocationProviders$DefaultLocationProvider of interface org.apache.iceberg.io.LocationProvider. Make sure the implementation is in classpath, and that it either has a public no-arg constructor or a two-arg constructor taking in the string base table location and its property string map.\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.LocationProviders.locationsFor(LocationProviders.java:52)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.BaseMetastoreTableOperations.locationProvider(BaseMetastoreTableOperations.java:243)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.BaseTable.locationProvider(BaseTable.java:245)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.SerializableTable.<init>(SerializableTable.java:84)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.spark.source.SerializableTableWithSize.<init>(SerializableTableWithSize.java:36)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.spark.source.SerializableTableWithSize.copyOf(SerializableTableWithSize.java:48)\r\n        at org.apache.iceberg.spark.source.SparkBatch.planInputPartitions(SparkBatch.java:77)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputPartitions$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:63)\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that Spark needs to create a `SerializableTable` object for getting input partitions in order to read data and it cannot create it without a location provider implementation provided. It is because location provider field is eagerly populated, but it's not necessary to make `SerializableTable` usable for reading data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1814274741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1814306949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8872#issuecomment-1814306949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8872","id":1814306949,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85sJCCF","user":{"login":"zinking","id":118241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODI0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking","html_url":"https://github.com/zinking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zinking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-16T11:59:42Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T11:59:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thank you, @zinking!

I've seen this happen in a few different instances, \r\n\r\n1. (Most Common in General) The Spark Session was already created at the time that \"getOrCreate\" was called and the extensions are ignored. \r\n2. (Most Common in Notebooks) The Spark Session is improperly cloned between threads used by the kernel. I've seen this most commonly with kernels using functional libraries (like cats) or something to managing execution. I'm not sure how this happens (but i've seen in sporadically) but I see that sometimes certain cells will be using SparkSession.getActiveSession to execute their SQL and when they do so they end up picking up a session which somehow was cloned without the config set. When directly queried the config will appear set, but when you access the \"active session\" during some executions it will vanish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1814755871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1814809415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8970#issuecomment-1814809415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8970","id":1814809415,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85sK8tH","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-16T16:33:14Z","updated_at":"2023-11-16T16:33:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank

In certain cases, when there's branches the DELETE in Spark gets executed via the `DeleteFromTableExec` execution path. This goes through Iceberg's `DeleteFiles` API and expectedly fails the validation (since we cannot delete a file where some records may not match the condition). If I understand right the purpose of this physical execution node is to do a \"metadata\" only delete. But that cannot be done in this case so we fail.\r\n\r\n2.) In other cases (deleting from main table state or even some cases in branches)  goes through `ReplaceDataExec` which will go through Iceberg's `Overwrite` API which is writing out entirely new files and thus succeeds.\r\n\r\nI'm working on determining on codifying what exactly the difference is that leads to this different physical execution on the spark side. Ultimately seems like we should not be attempting a metadata delete in this case, so I'm digging through that logic.\r\n\r\nIt seems like a possible workaround in the interim to unblock deletions on branches could be to go through `MERGE INTO` path and self join on the deletion criteria because that seems to always go through the `ReplaceDataExec` path, but still need to validate
