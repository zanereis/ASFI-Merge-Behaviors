Proxy and web servers have timeouts for a reason. With 5 minutes timeouts we potentially enable users to hammer the database(s) pretty heavily and allow for a not-so-interactive experience in the dashboard and explore view. The timeout forces users to summarize their data upfront which arguably is a good thing. Also if the web server has timed out, the user should be informed of it, and I think that (from what I know) without a client timeout there's no way to know in some cases.\r\n\r\nIf pushing the logic of long timeout to the extreme, you end up having to provision a lot of web workers to support hung-up database queries. When all web worker slots are taken by a poorly designed dashboard (or a database that is brought to its knees), you can't even serve the basic assets and pages anymore. I'm speaking from experience here where we experience flat out 504 on all pages when Presto comes to a crawl for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking that it would be best to leverage the Celery worker infrastructure for all database interactions (when available), as opposed to increasing the timeouts and number of web worker slots.\r\n\r\nI agree Superset shouldn't force you to define a specific timeout though. If you want to make it 10 minutes timeouts and however how many web workers you need to support that you should be able to.
