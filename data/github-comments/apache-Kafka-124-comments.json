it would be useful to have an idea of what the overall plan is. It looks like `InternalTopologyBuilder` is basically what `TopologyBuilder` is currently. Then the new `TopologyBuilder` just delegates and only provides an api that is sensible to the PAPI. So far so good.\r\nI'm not entirely sure what value `InternalKStreamBuilder` is going to provide? Why not just have `KStreamBuilder` depend on `InternalTopologyBuilder`? I think eventually we need all of the information on the topology in one place, i.e., `InternalTopologyBuilder`, such that it can be used by `StreamThread` to build the `ProcessorTopology`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/270359174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/270359986","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1579#issuecomment-270359986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1579","id":270359986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM1OTk4Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-04T12:28:10Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T12:28:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

For `WindowedSerde`, inner serde is required, so if it is not passed in constructor, which is possible, we need to construct it in `configure` function, which will be auto-triggered when the instance is created by reflection.

clear separation of `TopologyBuilder` and the DSL -- if we achieve this, we can also remove `InternalKStreamBuilder` and put its helper methods as private into `KStreamBuilder` -- right now, the abstractions are still leaky in this PR with this regard.\r\n\r\nI agree, that in final refactoring, runtime should be have any idea if a topology was build via `TopologyBuilder` or `KStreamBuilder`
