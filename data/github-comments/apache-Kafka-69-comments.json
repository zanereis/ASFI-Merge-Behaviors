Also I do not know how you directly addressed it in your patch.\n\nAbout the first item, I agree that for some simple topology (i.e. a record takes very few cycles to process) recording the latency for each record could be an overhead, and we could possibly approximate it by recording the total time for a batch and divided by the batch size as \"average latency for processing a record\". But I am a bit unclear for your use case as you mention it is \"a complex streams job\", which I assume means on average processing a record would take long time, then in this case, it is abnormal to see this metric recording taking 50% CPU to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/222851913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/222853046","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1448#issuecomment-222853046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1448","id":222853046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjg1MzA0Ng==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T23:39:14Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T23:39:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @gfodor , LGTM overall.

Our job runs against about 18 topics, most of which have 16 partitions and two which have 128. In the profiling I did, a vast majority of the CPU time was spent in the Sensor.record() call, both for the metrics of the run loop around poll + process time, and the latency measuring when reading/writing from the state stores.

for reducing the sensor call for recording `poll` latency, usually `consumer.poll` should only be called infrequently when there are not enough data in the buffer, so I would be surprised if `sensors.pollTimeSensor.record(endPoll - startPoll);` is called very frequently, could you verify if that is the case? If yes, maybe you can consider tuning buffer size and consumer max poll records to reduce the polling frequency.\n\nAs for recording \"process\" latency, a few optimizations that I can think of if we want to maintain its semantics (i.e. processing latency per record):\n1. Only call \"task.process()\" if the buffer size is not zero, meaning that `process` will take effect.\n2. Accumulate process time (maybe also \"poll\") inside the run loop as well as the number of times they are called, and take the average per every X `runLoop` to call `record`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223029914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223031553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1410#issuecomment-223031553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1410","id":223031553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzAzMTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T15:33:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T15:33:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbejeck

Overall looks good. Here is one general comment:\n\nWe should not require serdes in `KStream.map()` as it is supposed to be non-stateful operators and hence users are not expected to have any materialization JUST FOR this operator. Plus, some other operators like `selectKey` would also need similar handing if we do this direction.\n\nAs about join operations, since the join operators already requires the serdes which would be just reused for the repartition topic, we do not need to require it before hand in `map`, `selectKeys`, etc. Similar situation for `reduce`, which already requires the serdes for original key and value.\n\nHence the only problem is for `aggregate`, where the original value serde is not provided. After thinking about it for a bit more, I'm now more towards doing KAFKA-3576 for aggregations as well, i.e. introduce a `KGroupedStream` which can be generated from `KStream.groupBy` (which can then require serdes). In addition, `KStream.groupBy` may also take a `Windows` spec (we can overload the function with and without this parameter) so that later aggregations do not need to specify it anymore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223089394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223091719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1363#issuecomment-223091719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1363","id":223091719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzA5MTcxOQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T18:59:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T18:59:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vahidhashemian This mostly looks good, but left a few minor comments. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223091719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223121974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1453#issuecomment-223121974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1453","id":223121974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzEyMTk3NA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T20:56:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T20:56:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A few more suggestions:\n1. As in `KGroupedTable KTable.groupBy(..)`, the repartitioning does not happen at the `groupBy` operator, but we carry the serde information as well as the select-key mapper along with the `KGroupedTable`, which can only call aggregations; then the repartitioning is done when `aggregate / reduce / etc` is really called. We can do the same for `KStream`.\n2. A few differences of the `KGroupedStream` though, is that besides the serde and key-select mapper information, we can also allow users to specify the Windows spec so that the `KGroupedStream` conceptually captures a stream grouped by key and as well as windows (this is from user interfacing point of view only, no correctness issues at all), then its aggregation function do not need to provide any Windowing specs any more.\n3. Also for `KGroupedStream.reduce`, we do not need to require users provide any more serdes, as they should already be provided in the previous `groupBy`.\n4. As for joins, we are going to still let users do the pattern of `stream1.selectKey().join(stream2, serdes..)` or `stream1.map().join(stream2, serdes..)`, but auto-creating the repartition topic inside the `join` operator; note that again since the serdes are passed in the later join operator, we do not need to enforce users to provide them in previous `selectKey` or `map` operator.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223121974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223129239","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1363#issuecomment-223129239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1363","id":223129239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzEyOTIzOQ==","user":{"login":"vahidhashemian","id":13593506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13593506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian","html_url":"https://github.com/vahidhashemian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vahidhashemian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T21:23:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T21:23:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Thank you for the recent feedback.

meaning.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223190042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223190110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1325#issuecomment-223190110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1325","id":223190110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzE5MDExMA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T04:02:43Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T04:02:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223190110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/223194529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1390#issuecomment-223194529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1390","id":223194529,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzE5NDUyOQ==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T04:47:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T04:47:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM,

Normally the way stuff like this is handled is to ensure the new option is made available in one release without changing defaults so that scripts don't break but you can warn users that there will be a change, then change the default in a subsequent release.
