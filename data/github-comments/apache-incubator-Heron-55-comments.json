We would essentially have to put all the user defined environment properties on the java command line that starts the heron instance in a format:  -Denv.variable=foo .  If the user has many environment properties, this could cause the java command line to start the heron instance to be very large.  I don't know if that is a good idea. Doing a System.setProperty in the start of the heron instance seems like a more eloquent approach","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/336211402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/336236413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/2416#issuecomment-336236413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/2416","id":336236413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjIzNjQxMw==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-12T19:09:28Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T19:09:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jerrypeng sounds fair enough.
