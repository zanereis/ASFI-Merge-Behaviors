During the power sync, CloudStack tried to invoke the target \"ClusteredVirtualMachineManagerImpl.HandlePowerStateReport\" and failed as HandlePowerStateReport was not implemented in ClusteredVirtualMachineManagerImpl and was private in VirtualMachineManagerImpl. Changed HandlePowerStateReport() in VirtualMachineManagerImpl to protected so that CloudStack can get to the target.
