Do you have plan to run flink cluster in k8s in future ?\r\n\r\nHi @zjffdu , thanks for reviewing this pr. you are right, this pr only aims to run flink interpreter on k8s, and execution modes of flink job are still `local|remote|yarn`.\r\n\r\nIndeed it would be more reasonable to run flink job in [flink-kubernetes-session](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/ops/deployment/native_kubernetes.html#flink-kubernetes-session) mode when flink interpreter is running on k8s. I will find out how to add this new execution mode to flink interpreter in next pr.\r\n\r\nbtw, is there any problem with the change in `common.sh` and `interpreter.sh`? I am not sure whether it is a good way to solve jar conflict of log4j.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/676882177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/677670595","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3885#issuecomment-677670595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3885","id":677670595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzY3MDU5NQ==","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T13:39:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T13:39:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think downgrading to CentOS 6 is not an option.
