Basically, instead of having a shared instance of the TestRunner for all the test suite, I initialize one each time (to be sure there is no conflict between the tests and to avoid issues in cases tests are not executed in the same order each time). Regarding your comment about the validation failing, it's because we're providing a default value \"_id\". Because of that the property will always return true to isSet(). Since we're adding a new property and the user needs to use one of the two, I suggest removing the default value: it does not break anything, and it \"forces\" the user to understand the choice the user is doing. Does that make sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/374590974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/374615439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2560#issuecomment-374615439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2560","id":374615439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDYxNTQzOQ==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T14:21:51Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T16:30:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I agree that another PR/JIRA can be issued for the more elaborate indication of processor-specific variables in the EL. The only issue that I have with this as-is, is that if we have processor that still indicates `.expressionLanguageSupported(true)`, in the UI all that it says is \"Expression Language Scope: NONE\" and that believes me to believe that Expression Language is not supported. I think if the processor still indicates `true` instead of the Scope, that we still show in the UI: \"Expression Language Supported: true\" or whatever it is that we show currently.\r\n\r\nThe only other note, which is very minor, is that in the UI I would avoid showing the Scope as NONE, VARIABLE_REGISTRY, FLOWFILE_ATTRIBUTES and instead use human-friendly syntax: \"Not Supported\", \"Variable Registry Only\" and \"Variable Registry and FlowFile Attributes\" - perhaps just update ExpressionLanguageScope enum to contain a \"description\" or something and then populate the DTO with that?
