I like version B most. You don't have to duplicate code, because you don't need `MemoryImpl`, you can return `WritableMemoryImpl` from static factory methods which return `Memory` (read-only) as well. And read-only flag also won't be needed in this case, because Java compiler will ensure there are no illegal accesses, if we follow two simple rules: don't explicitly cast any `Memory` instance to `WritableMemory`, and don't use `Memory` as generic parameter.\r\n\r\nI believe it's important to keep read-only and writable interfaces separate, I explained above why:

There are only writable implementations. The only thing that e. g. map() does is delegation to mapWritable(), and return the read-only interface. It is safe on the type-system level with very little precautions. Your approach with runtime separation provides extra safety, if you want to keep this safety - yes, you either still have x2 classes, or e. g. have a boolean flag \"writable\" and check it guarded by assertion, e. g. in checkOffset() method, along with the offset check.\r\n\r\nNow that I read it again carefully and in the context of your latest comments, I understand what happened.  I interpreted \"implementations\" as \"classes that have been implemented\", assuming the looser interpretation of \"implementations\". What you meant by \"implementations\" is \"concrete classes\" as opposed to an \"abstract classes\".  And since in the same paragraph, you suggested having a boolean flag, the looser interpretation of \"implementations\" directly leads to Version C! \r\n\r\nI will go back to Version B, but with ONE concrete WritableMemory class and no Memory concrete class :)\r\n\r\nIn your statement: \r\n\r\n> if we ... don't explicitly cast any `Memory` instance to `WritableMemory`...\r\n\r\nWho are \"we\"?  You and I certainly won't do that.  But what is there to prevent a user from doing that?  :)  \r\n\r\nAnd to make sure I understand what you mean, could you give me a code example of what you mean by:\r\n\r\n> and don't use `Memory` as generic parameter.\r\n\r\nThank you for your clarification on the need for the stateless root. I may as well keep the root stateless.\r\n\r\nI have completed some initial characterization tests on the performance of this new hierarchy based Version C. (I don't expect the different versions to vary much since they should all collapse down to a single object after compilation and JIT).  It is a little better than the current Memory implementation based on an `interface`, but still not as good as pure static calls, which will still be possible if a `WritableMemory` object is passed and the user goes to the trouble.\r\n\r\n**Current Memory Performance**\r\n\r\n![rwmemoryheapdirect_21feb17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12941506/23196105/62236946-f86c-11e6-85d5-3bdc01ef895e.png)\r\n\r\n**Version C Memory Performance**\r\n\r\n![rwmemorycheapdirect_21feb17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12941506/23196119/7b7ec836-f86c-11e6-8982-343351b57aef.png)\r\n\r\n**Memory Performance using Static Methods Wrapping Unsafe**\r\n\r\n![rwmemoryheapdirectviastaticunsafe_21feb17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12941506/23196138/a9dfe016-f86c-11e6-9af3-b6733abc2e04.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/281560874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/281569951","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3939#issuecomment-281569951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3939","id":281569951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU2OTk1MQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T05:01:06Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T05:01:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jihoonson and about `poll` vs `take()` - before you explained, that timeout 0 means \"no wait\", but `take()` is blocking.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/281569951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/281574498","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3892#issuecomment-281574498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3892","id":281574498,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU3NDQ5OA==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T05:36:57Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T05:36:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Who are \"we\"?

Instead, `canStop()` throws an exception now, if it sees that `exitStart()` is not yet called. It shouldn't cause transient failures, because `start()` and `stop()` of any lifecycled object are expected to be called from a single thread, or at least being synchronized externally, like in the `Lifecycle` class. If this is not the case, i. e. `start()` and `stop()` are called truly concurrently from different threads, it also looks like a bug.
