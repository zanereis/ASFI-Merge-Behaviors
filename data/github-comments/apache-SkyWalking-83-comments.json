Transfer zipkin span to SkyWalking segment has too many limits. That is why I submit the `no-analysis` mode. \r\n\r\nIn my mind, I prefer to build new analysis codes based on `no-analysis` mode, meaning, still saving span directly, and build the trace only in query stage. Becaust at that moment, no need to worry about client/server side spans, just build trace segment and segment ref. And only require client/server matching to do analysis, in your case, only try to identify these two spans(`component C (app A) -> http GET -> component A (app B)`), then metrics are generated by these two.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in SkyWalking native format and agent, we don't need to process this, we will merge component A->C(if they are all RPC client library instrumentations) automatically.
