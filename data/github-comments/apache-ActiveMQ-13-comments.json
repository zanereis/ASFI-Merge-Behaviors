I'm pretty sure a standard plugin could support this without needing to modify broker internals or the current scheduler code.\r\n\r\n@mattrpav we are streaming messages and scheduling some of them for a delayed delivery. We sometimes need to cancel or replace scheduled messages with their latest versions. Currently the only way to interact with the scheduled messages is via a job id. The problem is that the job id is not available until the message is inside the scheduler. The only way to get the job id is to keep polling the broker for its scheduled jobs. Not only this is very inefficient and resource intensive when there are many scheduled messages, but also there is no way to react in event driven fashion to a message that was just scheduled until it was actually dispatched. By sending activity advisory messages with the job Id and group id I can have a pub-sub system that is always in sync with the scheduler and allows me to remove the scheduled jobs by mapping some attributes, like a group id to its job id, and ultimately cancel the job associated with the specific message. I am open to any other means of achieving the same. This feature seems rather harmless, as it is fully backward compatible and does not get turned on unless explicitly configured.

As far as multiple activity trackers are concerned, it is rather straightforward to implement a  class that wraps many trackers into one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1374072705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1374092035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/949#issuecomment-1374092035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/949","id":1374092035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85R5vsD","user":{"login":"maxfortun","id":10181876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTgxODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10181876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun","html_url":"https://github.com/maxfortun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxfortun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T20:23:45Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:23:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Something like this:\r\n```xml\r\n        <jobSchedulerActivityListener>\r\n            <bean xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\" id=\"jobSchedulerMultipleActivityListeners\"\r\n                class=\"org.apache.activemq.broker.scheduler.JobSchedulerMultipleActivityListeners\">\r\n                <property name=\"listeners\">\r\n                    <list>\r\n                        <bean xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\"\r\n                            id=\"jobSchedulerForwardingActivityListener\"\r\n                            class=\"org.apache.activemq.broker.scheduler.JobSchedulerForwardingActivityListener\" />\r\n                    </list>\r\n                </property>\r\n            </bean>\r\n        </jobSchedulerActivityListener>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1374092035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1374104344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/949#issuecomment-1374104344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/949","id":1374104344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85R5ysY","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T20:36:42Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:38:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, I just can't get there with the current approach.

- I reworked this a bit and have a commit here as a follow on to yours that I think makes a bit more sense: https://github.com/cshannon/activemq/commit/bf30a92809d49c7857843af7fdcbc95a114640cd\r\n\r\nIt simplifies things and drops the flag as I think it's just a bug that should be fixed. The more I think about it the more it just seems completely wrong to not have an audit per DLQ destination. I didn't do much with the tests so that would need to be looked at. I also wonder if 10k is too high and maybe we should lower the default because of memory usage. \r\n\r\nThe last thing is I don't really like the LRU cache we have, it's super outdated. It would be much better to use something like Caffeine where we don't need to synchronize. That being said, that's probably a bigger task as we'd need to pull in that dependency and I would think we'd just want to replace it everywhere, not just here. Also, (in theory) the DLQ stuff shouldn't be hit all the time so hopefully performance wouldn't be a big deal as I wouldn't normally expect a ton of attempts to acquire the lock at the same time but I guess it's possible if things are going really bad.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1422497968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1422848814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/965#issuecomment-1422848814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/965","id":1422848814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85UzvMu","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T15:57:49Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T15:57:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cshannon sounds good.

It uses the original destination and not the DLQ destination the message is going to which means that in some cases (like if destinationPerDurableSubscriber flag is true) a copy of the message for each destination still wouldn't be DLQ'd as more than one destination still shares a message audit.

A follow in issue/PR can be created to improve it further if desired to handle the more complex cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1423292639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1430337307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/969#issuecomment-1430337307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/969","id":1430337307,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85VQTcb","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T20:31:41Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T20:38:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattrpav  - So looking at this and thinking about it more I am seeing several problems including the fact that I realized this doesn't actually solve the problem for Spring boot compatibility.\r\n\r\n1. This doesn't really make sense to introduce a new module like this into 5.17.x for a point/bug fix release as 5.17.x has already been out a while. Furthermore this only copies JMS 1.1 classes so is completely broken for most of the methods. This should be targeted for a future version.\r\n\r\n2. In main/5.18.x there has been more JMS 2.0 work done so we should be using that as the baseline for this because it handles things properly like working between vendors. But there's still more work to be done because not everything is implemented. Any of the API methods that can be implemented now probably should be. I think most things besides shared subs can probably be done.\r\n\r\n3. Anyone that uses the Jakarta API could reasonably assume that calling any method should work. Since there is no previous Jakarta messaging version before 3.0 any code that is Jakarta compatible could assume the spec should work so we would need to finish the implementation or at least be very clear in the documentation what won't work.\r\n\r\n4. This doesn't actually fix the issue for Spring Boot 3 Spring Boot won't be able to add back in support because Spring boot is going to pull in the server itself to allow running the 5.x broker and the broker doesn't use the new Jakarta API. A new Jakarta client would only work if using just the client in the JVM and not the broker itself. We would need a new broker version that didn't require the JMS jar as well. For Spring 6.x I'm not sure, it may be good enough if it's just client support but if Spring 6 is calling off to any new methods that are not implemented in their messaging module (which they reasonably can do as I pointed out in number 3) then this breaks and won't work.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1430337307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1431265035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/969#issuecomment-1431265035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/969","id":1431265035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85VT18L","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-15T12:05:26Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T12:05:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just noticed https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/968 so maybe this PR just gets closed and we go with that one instead if not using this for 5.17.x anymore","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1431265035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1432182784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/979#issuecomment-1432182784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/979","id":1432182784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85VXWAA","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-15T22:51:26Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T22:51:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is ready for review now, I updated the getBody() method to copy into a new object.

- going forward instead of always force pushing it's probably better to just push new commits. The issue is any comments/history get blown away every time you force push so I can't see what you changed from the last time. This is ok for small stuff but is annoying for larger commits.\r\n\r\nThe best workflow I have found is what is used on Apache Accumulo:\r\n\r\n1. Push new commits as you make changes, **don't force push**\r\n2. If you want to get the latest changes from the original branch (ie main) don't rebase off main as then you'd have to force push. Instead just merge main into this branch periodically and push up the commit. ie \"**git merge main**\"\r\n3. When it comes time to do the final merge, pick the \"**Squash and merge**\" option. This will squash everything into 1 commit and add it to the end so we essentially get the same effect as if you had force pushed and re-based but the history doesn't always get blown away. When you pick this option it allows you to modify the commit message so you can change it before the final merge.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1465875597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1467218127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/931#issuecomment-1467218127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/931","id":1467218127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85Xc_jP","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-14T01:47:31Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T01:47:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Replaced
