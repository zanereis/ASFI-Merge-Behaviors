As long as the object you're serializing has a no-args constructor and you register it Kryo should be able to figure it out. Here's an example topology that serializes a JSONObject with Kryo <a href=\"https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/demo-jsonobj-serialization/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/ExclamationTopology.java\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/srdo/storm/blob/demo-jsonobj-serialization/examples/storm-starter/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/starter/ExclamationTopology.java</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've used json-simple here, but Gson or Jackson setups are going to look very similar. Note that you need to register the JSONObject class with Kryo in order for Kryo to serialize it. I also included a bit of code demonstrating how to do custom serialization in case your classes can't be serialized with Kryo (in this case using a to String serialization).

It should be virtual. So 1 Topology should not be equal to 1 worker process.</p>\n\n<p>We should have an option to say N Topologies in 1 Worker process. If one choose 1 topology in 1 worker process which is the current design this should address it.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond this all the features of a topology should be exactly the same within the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With regard to the fail fast option this too should be optional depending on where the error occurred.</p>\n\n<p>A topology can fail due to the following constructs<br/>\n1. Technology (Storm itself)<br/>\n2. Topology</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Configuration inside Topology</li>\n\t<li>Data inside (Tuples) Topology</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Technology<br/>\nWhile the Technology failures are beyond the control and when the worker process dies due to out of memory, node restart etc. In this case the N Topologies are in 1 worker process, all topologies die, which is the case even if we kept it in multiple worker process it would have died when node is restarted. The out of memory is similar instead of 1 topology, N topologies die. This occurrence is rare.</p>\n\n<p>Topology<br/>\nThe topology can fail due to <br/>\nConfiguration<br/>\nThis is accepted that as soon as some configuration on any topology fails, that particular topology should fail so all topologies would fail in the combined option. This occurrence is development time and is not wildly found at run time.</p>\n\n<p>Data Inside (Tuples)<br/>\nWhile failing the entire topology could be an option, this is not feasible in most data processing. The variation in data being processed is so much a schema bound approach is not always possible. So there is always those data that the bolts code don't understand and either can choose to ignore the message and log an error or error out die.</p>\n\n<p>Since a topology dying has it own consequence of not able to know which bolt processed last to replay, one should have an option not to die. Incase of a data issue even dying and coming back alive does not solve the problem as the same data would be replayed leading to the death of the topology again and again. So a data issue that stops processing unless corrected or waits till correction could be an approach that was taken. The other which is ignore the error and continue is also the option which could also be given a choice. In this case the bolt do not die but do a try catch and never allow the exception to go outside itself and acknowledge the incorrect data so that the next message can be processed.</p>\n\n\n<p>So in practice it could be have an analogy to an API Server.<br/>\nIf 1 API Server  Process hosts 1 API this is 1 Topology to 1 Worker Process<br/>\nIf 1 API Server Process hosts  N APIs this is N Topologies in 1 Worker Process<br/>\nSo all aspects of failure of API  to serve a request applies to the Worker Process and should be independent of the other APIs hosted in the API Server.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613046489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613046496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6605#issuecomment-2613046496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6605","id":2613046496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwNDY0OTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-20T03:14:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:28:55Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kabhwan\">kabhwan</a>:</i>\n<p>I'm afraid that the origin usage of Storm is in fact opposite, as you can see \"Why use Storm?\" in the index page: Apache Storm is a free and open source \"distributed\" realtime computation system.

about 200 to 300 microseconds slower 9.6 ms vs 9.9 ms.  The bigger issue in my mind is the CPU time as it went up from about 79 seconds (max 30 second period) every 30 seconds to 92 seconds (min 30 second period after stabilizing). That was at least a 16% increase in CPU usage.\r\n\r\nAt 75,000 sentences per second metrics v2 was just able to keep up with that throughput while 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT could handle it easily. I will not compare the latency because metrics v2 didn't stabilize enough for me to feel good reporting the numbers, but the CPU time went up from 118 seconds every 30 seconds to 130 seconds.  That was an increase of at least 9%.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to do 100,000 sentences per second neither of the two could keep up, but 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT hit a maximum of 97k while metrics V2 hit a maximum of 78k or 20% less maximum throughput.  Only here did we see the CPU usage be lower for metrics V2 with 134 seconds vs 141 for 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT, but if we take into account the actual throughput and look at CPU seconds needed to process 1k sentences per second it is 1.7 for metrics v2 vs 1.5 for 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nIf you need me to run the numbers again on different hardware I can, but it may take me some more time to get access to bare metal as I find VMs produce less reliable numbers than my laptop does.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that these changes are a blocker for the code going in, but I really want to understand what is happening here\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/346073151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/346075601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2203#issuecomment-346075601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2203","id":346075601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjA3NTYwMQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-21T16:09:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T16:09:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also looking at the numbers from @HeartSaVioR.

So this is a huge step in the right direction. \r\n\r\nI really would love to see an overhead of < 1%, but I could probably live with these numbers.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to try an experiment where we also do random sub-sampling with these metrics?  I know it is a giant confusion for people to not have an exact number for metrics, but I would be curious to see what difference if any it would make so we know what the issue is.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/347228169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/347242856","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2430#issuecomment-347242856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2430","id":347242856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzI0Mjg1Ng==","user":{"login":"Ethanlm","id":14900612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14900612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm","html_url":"https://github.com/Ethanlm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ethanlm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T16:44:46Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T16:45:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I filed a separate jira for ` ConfigValidation.validateFields` related issue because it looks like there are many places using wrong function.
