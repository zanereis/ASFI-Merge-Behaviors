You haven't gotten my point. If spans could be duplicate, then both plugins work, then the only possibility a trace breaks, because the context doesn't propagate(across threads mostly), you just need a snapshot to propagate a context. Right now, you are creating another span, which makes you facing the duplicate span issue. We have plugins for Spring scope and out of Spring scope, they should not influence each other.\r\n> \r\n> The plugin system is complex, we should never make users to determine how to choose in or out Spring use case, they will be confused about the difference.\r\n\r\nwell, it looks like I misunderstand *optional* plugins.😅 does that mean we need to focus on rabbitmq itself, rather than spring rabbit? And what do you mean by **a snapshot to propagate a context**?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886004145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886004155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/7367#issuecomment-886004155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7367","id":886004155,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls840z1m7","user":{"login":"Ax1an","id":28091237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDkxMjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28091237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an","html_url":"https://github.com/Ax1an","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-24T05:45:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-24T05:45:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wu-sheng Yes, our Grafana UI already has these.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/886004155/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
