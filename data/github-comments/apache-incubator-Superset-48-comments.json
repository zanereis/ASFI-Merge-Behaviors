I think when there is no need to separate client-side from server-side (meaning you can use Jinja templates to pass variables to javascript), then your solution is far more robust.\r\n\r\n@xrmx, I'd prefer a solution like @joharohl described where the `SCRIPT_NAME` is entirely controlled by the proxy server. This allows for really cool setups where the `SCRIPT_NAME` doubles as the authentication mechanism on intranets. E.g.:\r\n`http://example.intranet/user1/superset/welcome` logs in user1  and shows the dashboards they're authorised for through the `REMOTE_USER` authentication method. Then user2 can simply go to `http://example.intranet/user2/superset/welcome` for their dashboards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/268279777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/268469938","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1872#issuecomment-268469938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1872","id":268469938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODQ2OTkzOA==","user":{"login":"xrmx","id":12932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx","html_url":"https://github.com/xrmx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xrmx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T08:54:59Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T08:54:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Are you using 0.15.0 or master?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/268469938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/268476610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/1866#issuecomment-268476610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1866","id":268476610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODQ3NjYxMA==","user":{"login":"joharohl","id":1255775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTU3NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1255775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl","html_url":"https://github.com/joharohl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joharohl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T09:29:25Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T09:29:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We also need a dynamic prefix/subdir for our usecase.
