I have some quick question:\r\n1. Have you tested various models arm cpu? (like A53, A72, A55, A75 and so on). According to fb qnnpack blog, it is not always could get best performance using `umul` / `uadalp ` compared with `smlal` instruction (used by now). (https://engineering.fb.com/ml-applications/qnnpack/). So just change legalization and give it up `smlal` instruction in aarch64 maybe doesn't make sense to me. One proof:  our coming feature `Ansor` (auto scheduler) doesn't support tensorize (at least till now), however, it could get nice performance using `smlal` instruction and beyond TFLite 1.2X on mobilenet v2 quantized model (cortex-a53) (https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/tflite-and-tvm-comparison-for-quantized-models/6577/4). I mean here:\r\n```python\r\n@qnn_conv2d_legalize.register('arm_cpu')\r\ndef _qnn_conv2d_legalize_arm_cpu(attrs, inputs, types):\r\n    # ARM prefers the dtypes to be same.\r\n    if is_aarch64_arm():\r\n        return helper_change_dtypes_to_be_same(attrs, inputs, types, relay.qnn.op.conv2d)\r\n    return helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization(attrs, inputs, types, relay.qnn.op.conv2d)\r\n```\r\nIt disables us using `SMLAL` instruction.\r\n\r\n2. I suggest we keep two schedules (tensorize and default spatial pack). Not just check `aarch64` and only use tensorize template. I mean here:\r\n```python\r\nis_aarch64 = \"aarch64\" in str(isa.target)\r\nif is_aarch64 and data.dtype in [\"int8\", \"uint8\"]:\r\n    strategy.add_implementation(\r\n        wrap_compute_conv2d(topi.arm_cpu.compute_conv2d_NHWC_quantized),\r\n        wrap_topi_schedule(topi.arm_cpu.schedule_conv2d_NHWC_quantized),\r\n        name=\"compute_conv2d_NHWC_quantized.arm_cpu\")\r\nelse:\r\n    strategy.add_implementation(\r\n        wrap_compute_conv2d(topi.arm_cpu.conv2d_nhwc_spatial_pack),\r\n        wrap_topi_schedule(topi.arm_cpu.schedule_conv2d_nhwc_spatial_pack),\r\n        name=\"conv2d_nhwc_spatial_pack.arm_cpu\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is our design purpose of strategy. I suspect there is some workload our spatial pack could perform better. This situation is the same as Winograd, we could perform winograd and default template and choose better.

I will address general replies here, and code comments in a separate reply.\r\n\r\n* I indeed read your discuss [post](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/tflite-and-tvm-comparison-for-quantized-models/6577/4), but I thought the work was orthogonal to this one. My main goal here is to have a fast general convolution algorithm for Armv8-A. Your post talks about mobilenet v2, and raspi 3. \r\n* In mobilenet v2 there are no deep convolutional layers, mostly depthwise convolutions and 1x1 convolutions. With shallow convolutions the problem becomes memory bound, and the differences among the algorithms  become less evident. That is also why I picked inception_v3, where there are 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 1x7, 7x1 convolutions. \r\n* Raspi 3 comes with a 32bit operative system, which means using Armv7-A. The problem with Armv7-A is that instead of having 32 registers (as in Armv8-A) you have only 16, so the optimization space is reduced. Also, I think (but I am not 100% sure) that the guys in TFlite do not extremely optimize for Armv7-A. Indeed, on Armv7-A @anijain2305 shows (in the same post you mention) a 0.80 ratio for tflite/tvm (while I see a 0.60/0.30 ratio for multi/single thread scenarios, respectively ). \r\n* The Qnnpack post you mention explicitly says that: \"the microkernel that leverages the dual issue capability proves to be 15 percent to 20 percent faster for a sufficiently large channel count (K > 64)\"\r\n* The way they do convolution (and gemm) in Qnnpack for Armv8-A is by using a combination of `smlal` and `smlal2` (plus a combination of `usubl` and `usubl2`) while `conv2d_nhwc_spatial_pack` only uses `smal`. It is true that in Armv7-A they only use `vsmal` (and `vusubl`). So, I wonder if the autoscheduler (which I am not familiar with) is able to generate such combinations for armv8. \r\n* I did not try other CPUs other than the Cortex-A76. The point is that I am not using anything specific for that CPU, but only specific to the Armv8-A ISA.  \r\n* I agree that in case of smaller convolutions (or depthwise convolutions) there are simpler algorithms that work as well (or even faster). I also agree in stacking multiple strategies and let TVM select the best. \r\n\r\nI will reply on the code in the following comment.

One information I missed before, my testing rasp 3b+ os is Ubuntu 64 bits, not 32 bits, so the target is aarch64 too. \n\nI mention auto scheduler is not to question your work (your work is very great!) and is orthogonal as you said. I just mention that we use smlal inst on A53 (aarch64 os mentioned before) we could get nice performance too. So I want to know on low-end arm cpu, whether smlal is better than this (as fb qnnpack blog said: The default microkernel uses the fewest possible instructions and thus delivers the best performance on low-end cores, which can execute only one NEON instruction per cycle.).\n\nSo I wish we could test several arm cpus to proove our this work work well all aarch64 cores (low-end core, high-end core).\n\nSecondly, I suggest let us test mobilenet v2 too. To see that whether our pr could work well across various models. \n\nYour work is very great but I wish let us use more data and result to make it more convincing. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/642541198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/642543391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5754#issuecomment-642543391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5754","id":642543391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjU0MzM5MQ==","user":{"login":"giuseros","id":2017147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTcxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros","html_url":"https://github.com/giuseros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giuseros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-11T09:57:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T09:57:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @FrozenGene ,\r\nAbout the code changes. \r\n1) It will be hard to do this.

For example, we could add it in the `attr` and query it in the legalization pass, then we could throw it safely.\r\n\r\n> Note that I am targeting NHWC layout.

After our careful testing, NHWC is also perform better than NCHW on arm cpu using Ansor (aka auto scheduler) too. So this prompts us we could improve our AutoTVM NHWC schedule on arm cpu too.  As the result I show in the post,  we use auto schedule is to leverage NHWC layout and `smlal` instruction,  I prefer we could leverage `attr[algorithm_name]` mentioned previous to keep `smlal` instruction. After auto scheduler released (we are working hard to do it, we wish after 2 weeks we could bring it in), we could see how to improve it (like generating smlal and smlal2 or your tensorize instruction), they are orthogonal but they share the same legalize pass.\r\n\r\nOne background of auto scheduler: In auto scheduler, we only need tvm.compute, then we could generate schedule automatically, so we could try NHWC / NCHW easily.
