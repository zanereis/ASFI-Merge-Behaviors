So I could just use the number of cores, or divide `nproc`.\r\n\r\nDoing the string replacement when copying the file in bash shouldn't be a problem, I'll see if I can do it sensibly in batch as well.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1411718416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1411795175","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1311#issuecomment-1411795175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1311","id":1411795175,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5UJkjn","user":{"login":"asalamon74","id":13440318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDQwMzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13440318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74","html_url":"https://github.com/asalamon74","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asalamon74/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T10:06:07Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T10:06:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @bszabo97 committed the change to `main` and `branch_9x`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1411795175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1411849127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1320#issuecomment-1411849127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1320","id":1411849127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5UJxun","user":{"login":"colvinco","id":51863265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODYzMjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51863265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco","html_url":"https://github.com/colvinco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T10:45:01Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T10:45:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hopefully we're getting there now :)\r\nI didn't bother with trying to do variable substitution from batch as I didn't see a good + easy option.

We're doing something rather unusual in Lucene & Solr -- insisting on gradle.properties when countless Gradle projects have no such mandate.\r\n\r\nWell, depends on how you look at it. There is no way to configure reasonable static defaults for a 2-CPU laptop and a 128-core beast machine. And these \"sane\" defaults is what this file was originally about. If it were static, we could just commit it in to the repository (many projects do that, actually). But then folks wouldn't be able to tweak it and there's no way to split this configuration into multiple files (as far as I know, at least).\r\n\r\ngradle.properties can also be the only (required) option to, for example, open up jdk/gradle internals to plugins like spotless (it's where the JVM setup lives). \r\n\r\nI'd love those things to be configurable via different mechanism, but it's not something I invented or have much influence over.  For portability, I'd leave those defaults inside gradle and call the generation task from gradlew if this file doesn't exist.

If you rather want _delete_ then choose it, with a java-level default of \"true\".\r\n> \r\n> Do we need to treat this behaviour as a backward compatibility promise? If Solr 9.2 starts preserving cores, and it is documented in the upgrade notes, no client ode needs to be changed anywhere. \r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing Jan :)\r\nJust to confirm what you're saying, you're okay with the idea of changing the existing behavior so that it no longer automatically deletes unknown cores (and documenting accordingly)? Just checking because when you said `If you rather want _delete_ then choose it, with a java-level default of \"true\".` that would keep the existing behavior of deleting cores by default, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\n> Only users who perhaps explicitly modifies cluster-state directly in ZK and have high core churn, i.e. rely on current behavior to reclaim disk space, would suffer. Or do I understand the domain right?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the original motivation for the automatic deletion was to clean up after autoscaling operations or explicit deletes occurring when one or more nodes hosting replicas of the collection are offline SOLR-12066. Some of the comments on SOLR-13396 from 2019 suggest that manual cleanup on a large cluster would be painful. I don't know what the majority wants for this as a default. Not deleting is definitely the safest IMO.\r\n\r\nI see that some of the comments on the issue suggest some better end-to-end solutions which might put the administrator in the loop so that they can action/authorize the deletion, which sounds like a good long term solution.\r\n\r\nWe're currently using Solr 8 for our product with several modifications that we maintain, my (selfish :)) motivation is to get onto Solr 9 without any modification to the distribution, in the not too distant future. Configuration options are good enough for that stepping stone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1412401969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1412415473","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1322#issuecomment-1412415473","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1322","id":1412415473,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5UL7_x","user":{"login":"colvinco","id":51863265,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODYzMjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51863265?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco","html_url":"https://github.com/colvinco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colvinco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T17:10:56Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T17:10:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I'll close this one but I'll remember the comments on it","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1412415473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1412477182","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1321#issuecomment-1412477182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1321","id":1412477182,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5UMLD-","user":{"login":"janhoy","id":409128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTEyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/409128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy","html_url":"https://github.com/janhoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T17:50:57Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T17:50:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My point is the property name could be delete… with a default of true.\r\n\r\nUsers would need to set it to false to override.
