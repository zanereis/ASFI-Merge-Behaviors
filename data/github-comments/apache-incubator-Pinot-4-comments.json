We can easily extend this to offline table as well and make it mandatory if clients need support for default value. On loading a segment we can simply look at the columns in the schema and segment. If we find columns missing, we can create a sorted forward index column. We will have only one value in this column which will be derived using the default value in the schema. Once we generate this, rest of the query execution code should work as usual.\n\n**Things to consider**\n- Should we update the segment metadata when we add new columns. Till now we have always avoided modifying the segment.\n- What happens to already loaded segments, should we force restart of server or make use of segmentrefresh command to force reload of segment\n- What happens if the default value changes. With new segment format version, we don't support  remove yet.\n- Some of the existing usecases might rely on existing behavior where we skip segments that dont contain columns in query. We need to make sure the performance is not degraded for such use cases.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225047472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225051611","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/183#issuecomment-225051611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/183","id":225051611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTA1MTYxMQ==","user":{"login":"jrgp","id":472066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp","html_url":"https://github.com/jrgp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrgp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T22:59:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T22:59:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225051611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225055224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/161#issuecomment-225055224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/161","id":225055224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTA1NTIyNA==","user":{"login":"jfim","id":246807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim","html_url":"https://github.com/jfim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T23:21:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T23:21:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The biggest issue is if the default value changes, if we wrote a new column to disk, then we can't really fix it with a new default value.\n\nWhat we could do instead is have the column load generate a new column on the fly if it doesn't exist based on the schema values, with nothing written to disk.

I guess, you mean single\n> array as one value for multi-valued columns\n1. We should persist these columns for server scalability as we can easily\n   mmap those indexes. Otherwise, on shared multi-tenant clusters with, say,\n   2k segments and 3 additional columns, we need 6k indexes all required in\n   memory. That can quickly offset some of the gains of new file format.\n2. We should avoid server restarts for segment level changes. We already\n   require for inverted indexes but this can again be an issue in the shared\n   cluster. Instead, we can have servers 'force refresh' a segment using the\n   http admin endpoint (guaranteed action is an issue with http call)\n3. Remove is possible but very costly with the new segment format. We can\n   support, if really needed. If default value changes are rare, we can model\n   that as addition of yet-another-new-column. Older one sticks around as\n   default. Downside is that applications need to change for the changed\n   column name. One option is to logically delete it by marking the range\n   invalid. No major performance impact but there is some storage and memory\n   scale impact.\n4. Regarding users relying on pinot skipping segments - what will select\n   count(*) from myTable where new_column = new_column_default_value return ?\n   0 if we skip segments.

Check if the column if the column was a generated default value column (either with a synthetic column flag in the metadata or checking if it's a single value column), and if it doesn't match with the current default value, regenerate it.\n\nIf there's no \"synthetic column\" flag in the metadata, this gets even worse, because we have to have some weird logic somewhere that checks if it's a column with a single value. Of course, you can't just check if it's a column with a single value, because any column that has a sorted time column would likely have a single value too, and you don't want to replace that with default null values. So then we need to make this logic smarter and figure out a reasonable set of assumptions as to when we can assume the materialized column was because of default null values. If we get it wrong, then we just destroyed some user data and we need to ask them to fix the segments, and at that point, they would've been better off just backfilling on their own.\n\nI don't remember offhand the on-disk format for multivalues, but if I remember correctly, it's just indices into a linear array of values.

Answers should match given default value for foo is 0\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225225075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225225989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/161#issuecomment-225225989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/161","id":225225989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTIyNTk4OQ==","user":{"login":"antumbde","id":1058374,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058374?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde","html_url":"https://github.com/antumbde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antumbde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T16:10:56Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T16:10:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225225989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/225260571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/181#issuecomment-225260571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/181","id":225260571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTI2MDU3MQ==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T18:31:04Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T18:31:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @jfim .
