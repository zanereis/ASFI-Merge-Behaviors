But this is not the only change. Previously the output encoding matched `file.encoding` but as of JDK18+ it matches `sun.stdout.encoding`. Before PR#3836 Netbeans used `Charset.defaultEncoding()` implicitly to determine the output encoding. This of course failed with JDK18 when `sun.stdout.encoding` and `file.encoding` mismatched. PR#3836 uses `native.encoding` for the output which matches `sun.stdout.encoding` most of the time; so most problems where fixed with this.\r\n* What would be the proper checking order for the output encoding?\r\n  Quoting from [JEP400](https://openjdk.org/jeps/400): \r\n  > We will update the specifications of all standard Java APIs that use the default charset to cross-reference Charset.defaultCharset(). Those APIs include the ones listed above, but not System.out and System.err, whose charset will be as specified by [Console.charset()](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8264208).\r\n\r\n  So `native.encoding` is in fact not the right property to check for output encoding. The order thus should have been: `Console.charset()` → `sun.stdout.encoding` → `native.encoding` → `Charset.defaultEncoding()`\r\n* Is this a Windows only problem? Actually it is not. It occurs as soon as the platform default encoding (`native.encoding`) does not match the console's/terminal's encoding. Here is an [example](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/82939), albeit not a Netbeans one. I really do not get the insistence that the \"default console encoding\" is of any importance. To output to the console the console's *current* encoding instead of its default encoding should be used.\r\n\r\n[This link](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=579383) shows how it has been handled by the Eclipse IDE. \r\n\r\nBut despite my findings that `Console.charset()`/`sun.stdout.encoding` should be used instead of `native.encoding` to match the behavior introduced by JEP400, I will close this PR, as I think nobody really cares that `native.encoding` only works most of the time but not for all cases as it is in fact the wrong property to infer the output encoding from.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1179761900/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1179774342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/4107#issuecomment-1179774342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4107","id":1179774342,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5GUe2G","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-10T18:13:11Z","updated_at":"2022-07-10T18:13:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@singh-akhilesh thank you for the information - I was just wondering ;-).

However ...\r\n\r\n> I personally don't like it when IDEs display things inline which are not in the text. This creates weird habits, \r\n\r\nAgree with @mbien on this.  I think adding information via inline text does cause other problems.  OTOH having been running with it enabled over the last couple of releases, having the contextual information visible at all times (as opposed to something like `CTRL-p`) also has its value.

If it is read often enough the read comes straight from cache (apart from disc cache, if I remember correctly freemarker also caches).
