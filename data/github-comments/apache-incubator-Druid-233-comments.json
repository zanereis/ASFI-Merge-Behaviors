Essentially like a topN with HLL but with accuracy guarantees, and still better performance than an exact query. If that's the case then it sounds extremely useful. I'd love to see how you plan to implement that.\r\n\r\nIt would be especially useful if additional aggregations could be computed at the same time, such as computing the total (non-distinct) count for each key: `SELECT IPAddress, COUNT(DISTINCT UserID), COUNT(*) GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10`. In my experience it's common to compute multiple metrics in the same query in Druid. This looks like something that would be implemented in the Druid extension rather than the sketch itself though, although the sketch may need to expose some APIs to support that.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a draft extension ready I'll be happy to run it against some of our real-world datasets if that helps. I'll even pick some dimensions where topN fails badly for comparison 😄. I won't have time to help developing the extension itself, unfortunately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/480718601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/480762276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6768#issuecomment-480762276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6768","id":480762276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MDc2MjI3Ng==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T09:45:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T09:45:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request has been marked as stale due to 60 days of inactivity.

(To the \"Proposed changes\" section.) It sounds like we are settling on something like 'published segments that are overshadowed by some other published segment'. I would be fine with it being false for unpublished segments, if that makes it easier to implement. If that's what you do, then just make sure to include it in the docs, please. Maybe document it as something like:\r\n\r\n> `is_overshadowed` is true for segments that are published and that are overshadowed by _other_ published segments. Currently, `is_overshadowed` is always false for unpublished segments, although this may change in the future. You can filter for segments that \"should be published\" by filtering for `is_published = 1 AND is_overshadowed = 0`. Segments can briefly be both published and overshadowed if they were recently replaced, but have not been unpublished yet.\r\n\r\nI am ok with leaving `is_published` and `is_available` unchanged, and adding an `is_overshadowed` defined as above. I'm also fine with leaving out active/actual at this time and potentially adding them in a later change.

I'm not certain but I presume the reason this is allowed is detailed in these Hive issues HIVE-7189 and HIVE-4243 which chronicle how Hive would write ORC files without their real column names, instead just using _col0, _col1, etc. However, flattenSpec expressions would be a way to handle this with the new extension, as the fields could be extracted from the generic name _col0 or whatever into the desired column name manually. If we feel that we really need to continue to support the old way the extension worked, I could investigate possible mechanisms to retain this functionality of providing a typeString schema and extracting column names from it, but I don't feel that it is necessary.\r\n\r\nI agree here - in my experience writing the typeString is tough for people, and making it optional is a good thing. It sounds like flattenSpecs are going to be able to do all the stuff that typeStrings used to be able to do, which is nice because it's better aligned with how JSON/Avro/Parquet work.\r\n\r\n> Another incompatibility would be related to how the current extension handles OrcMap types. It provides a type of flattening 'magic' for maps of primitives that appear in the row with a name controlled by mapFieldNameFormat. Since the new extension would use flattenSpec, these names could be replicated to preserve existing Druid schemas with field extraction expressions.\r\n\r\nI feel similarly about this as the typeString thing. The move to 'core' seems like a good time to better align ORC with how other input formats work.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/481021756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/481021853","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7134#issuecomment-481021853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7134","id":481021853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTAyMTg1Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-08T21:51:14Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T21:51:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For the reasons mentioned in my last comment I am 👍 on the proposal.

I think removing it is ok, especially given that we're moving this from contrib to core, and it's a good time to make changes like this that improve maintainability.

Extra aggregations can still be computed in a follow-up query anyway, such as `SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(SomeColumn) WHERE IPAddress IN ('a', 'b', 'c')` where `a`, `b` and `c` are top IP addresses previously returned by the FUN query. This can work decently well with Druid indexes. One advantage of this approach is that the FUN query returns faster since it's not loaded with extra aggregations, so you can immediately show up the top items & unique counts to the user, with extra metrics following up later. In some cases that's better UX than a longer initial wait followed up by showing up everything at once. That's a bit off-topic but hopefully there's some value in listing the different ways in which this sketch could be used within Druid.\r\n\r\n> Can we start with just the \"top songs by unique users\" and characterize that first?\r\n\r\nSure. Are you looking for any specific patterns in the test data? I assume that Yahoo already has large datasets & Druid clusters that could be used, so I'm trying to see what I could bring to the table here.\r\n\r\n> Will you need an actual published artifact Jar to test this.

Or avoiding the lookup framework entirely?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I've been thinking recently about reviving proposals for joins in Druid and had been considering a few goals for a solution, below.\r\n\r\n- Integrate with Druid SQL so you can use the \"JOIN\" keyword. Druid SQL usage would be the main motivator for this feature, and so having nice SQL syntax is more important than having nice JSON syntax.\r\n- Only the left-most datasource could be a distributed, multi-server datasource. This is so the join doesn't require a system to shuffle data between servers.\r\n- All other datasources, other than the leftmost, being joined should be lookup tables (we should allow JOIN onto a lookup table, why not), broadcast datasources, queries, or literal datasources (like an array of rows embedded in the query).\r\n- If one of the datasources being joined is a query datasource, I'm thinking the broker should run the query first, and then convert it to a literal datasource before sending it down to the historicals. Druid SQL already has something like this special cased for semi-joins. It should hopefully allow us to remove the special case and just handle semi-joins like any other join.\r\n- Start with left/right/inner equijoins only (using a hash-based algorithm).\r\n- Later on, add support for non-equijoins.\r\n- Later still, add support for shuffling data between servers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/481850459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/481866416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7435#issuecomment-481866416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7435","id":481866416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTg2NjQxNg==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T21:09:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T21:09:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This

What the sketch is telling you is that given the configuration of your sketches and the cardinalities of your input streams, the \"true\" answer should be within those bounds with 95% confidence.  And theoretically this is the best you can do given the above.\r\n\r\nTheta sketches retain only a small sample of the input streams that that they see.  When you perform an intersection it reduces that small sample to an even smaller set, possibly zero!  And as you might guess, extracting useful information about your input streams with zero samples is rather difficult:\r\n\r\n![We_do_sketches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12941506/55978742-66e08600-5c45-11e9-9721-e746dafc7e87.png)\r\n\r\nSuccessive intersections will quickly reduce your number of samples available to estimate from and thus will dramatically increase the error.  Also attempting to intersect one sketch from a large cardinality set with another sketch from a very small cardinality set will also increase your error (see the 2nd link above).  \r\n\r\n**So what can you do?**\r\n\r\n- Organize your intersections (and AnotB ops) to be performed as the very last step.  For example,\r\ninstead of `AU(B^C)` use `(AUB)^(AUC)`. This keeps the internal sample set as large as possible until the very end.\r\n- If you know which streams have large cardinality, use large sketches for these sketches. Internally we use sketches of 2^20 for our large cardinality streams (there is generally only a few of them) and then 2^14 for everything else.\r\n- Always query the resulting sketch from a set expression to obtain the upper and lower bounds.   This will tell you right away what your error confidence interval is.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482247719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482249849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/7447#issuecomment-482249849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7447","id":482249849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjI0OTg0OQ==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-11T18:47:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T18:48:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The design with `SQLMetadataSegmentManager` enforcing leadership changes on its callers doesn't feel right to me.

The standard way to implement LDAP is to manage roles and permissions at the application/framework level as rules for managing roles/permissions can (and most likely will) be different from one application to another within an enterprise, and so they aren't managed within LDAP. Also, they are not 1:1. So it's normal/common to have a mix model of where some information is kept/managed at the application level and some information is stored in LDAP\r\n\r\n* The basic authenticator shares logic related to how basic auth credentials are retrieved from the http request; how those credentials are authenticated can be different, and the CredentialsValidator interface now provides a way support for more ways of validating basic auth credentials down the road. As described in our proposal the current basic security extension limits clients to use druid internal metadata store for authentication, and one of the goals/proposals is to refactor basic security extension authenticator to make it a bit more pluggable/configurable as to how to validate requests with basic authentication credentials. Moving in to separate contrib extension will result in duplication of logic related to how basic auth credentials are processed from the http request. \r\n\r\n* How druid authorizes a user in a basic auth credential request can be managed the same way regardless of how they got authenticated (db, ldap, etc). Basically, they differ in authentication methods, but not authorization. Also, it provides a way to reuse roles/permissions. For instance, an admin user and a user belonging to an admin group can be mapped to same role in the metastore. So, it makes sense to share the role definitions \r\n\r\n* If LDAP implementations evolve over time, the changes will be only limited to LDAPCredentialsValidator in how we interact with ldap and authenticate the user. How we retrieve/process basic auth credentails from the http request and authorize the user should stay the same. I think the druid basic auth security module as a whole will be evolved over time to support more ways of authenticating HTTP Basic Authentication requests, not just against db or ldap. How Spring security has achieved that is a really good example.\r\n\r\n* Some of the design decisions were adopted to preserve backward compatibility and not introduce any breaking changes. Leaving the BasicHTTPAuthenticator mostly as is to continue leveraging and make use of the \"basic\" json type name and introduced CredentialsValidator as a way authenticate a basic auth credential request either against db or ldap, default is db","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482270756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482289512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6581#issuecomment-482289512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6581","id":482289512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjI4OTUxMg==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-11T19:59:30Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T19:59:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@edgan8 This'll be available as a contrib extension starting in 0.15.0.

@jon-wei \r\n\r\nTo summarize some of the comments and feedbacks in this PR, and to establish a consensus/direction for next steps, the following are being adopted within this PR that I’m now working on:\r\n1. Remove all Authenticator and Escalator rolling credential update logic/feature.\r\n2. Keep LDAP functionality within existing basic auth extension as already done in the PR\r\n3. Expose additional LDAP config properties for SSLContext so users can configure/set the keystore, truststore, protocol, etc\r\n4. Separate out the authorizer checks between metadata-backed store user and LDAP group since the incoming request would be authorized against only one or the other\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482629784/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482634353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6763#issuecomment-482634353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6763","id":482634353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjYzNDM1Mw==","user":{"login":"egor-ryashin","id":14215045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin","html_url":"https://github.com/egor-ryashin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/egor-ryashin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T16:15:57Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T16:15:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@huahuang12

Something that may not need to be core is query metrics-based balancing (as opposed to the current cost-based balancing). (Out of scope of this proposal.)\r\n\r\nA fallback option to the old behavior should be present, but it should be off by default and removed timely because I don't see any point in supporting the old behavior. The old (current) implementation has many problems (see issues referenced in this proposal, but there are many more, at some point into the development of the new algorithm I stopped putting them into separate issues) and I don't see why would anybody want to use it instead of the new algorithm, other than for the sake of stability, when some rough edges will be found in the new algorithm. On the other hand, the new algorithm is not that different from the current implementation (as, for example, metrics-based vs. cost-based balancing, again) and it's expected to work at least as well as the current implementation in all cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482689404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/482709590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7461#issuecomment-482709590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/7461","id":482709590,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjcwOTU5MA==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-12T20:20:26Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T20:20:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is happening because HllSketchBuildBufferAggregator's `get(buf, position)` method does not copy data out from `buf` to the heap. topN and groupBy v2 (which works similarly) both call `get` on BufferAggregators from segment processing threads, then transfer those objects to another thread for merging (in this case, TopNBinaryFn is doing that merge).
