I have verified this fact by my own testing against OpenJDK11.  You can read my study on our ASF slack channel \"datasketches-dev\", which also reveals some performance consequences of moving to JDK11 as well.\r\n\r\nWe have started to investigate this issue as mentioned by Gian above, but to fix this will require some major rewrites and will likely take us quite awhile to do.  \r\n\r\nThis newest Apache release has some performance improvements and bug fixes that were specifically targeted for Druid. So if you want those improvements please allow this PR to go through.  As long as Druid is running on JDK 8, there is no problem.  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/544059470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/544071189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8647#issuecomment-544071189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8647","id":544071189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDA3MTE4OQ==","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-19T03:11:53Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T03:11:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think it would be reasonable to modify the tests to be skipped for now on newer java versions and we add this to list of known issues with running newer versions of java, though I'm not sure the best way to do that.

the partitionsSpec you used is the [hash-based partitioning](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/hadoop.html#hash-based-partitioning). To use the [range partitioning](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/hadoop.html#single-dimension-range-partitioning), the `type` of the partitionsSpec should be `single_dim` instead of `hashed`. This single-dimension range partitioning is supported only by the hadoop task for now and I believe the native parallel indexing task will support it in the next release. \r\n\r\n> Hi @jihoonson, I split data into different segments by single dimension tenant_id for the multitenancy scene. In this way, I can get higher query performance that filters on the tenant_id dimension.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty surprised by this and wondering how big the performance gain was in your case. Sadly, Druid doesn't support segment pruning in brokers for hash-based partitioning for now (this is supported only for single-dimension range partitioning). That means, even though your segments are partitioned based on the hash value of `tenant_id`, the broker will send queries to all historicals having any segments overlapping with the query interval no matter what their hash value is. I guess, perhaps you could see some performance improvement when you filter on `tenant_id` maybe because of less branch misprediction. Can you share your performance benchmark result if you can?\r\n\r\n> But tenant data was skew, so the segment size was not perfect. For example, the max segment size was nearly 18GB but the min segment size was 5MB. Then perform queries on the 18GB segment ware more slower than that partitioned by all dimensions.\r\n\r\nOne popular way to mitigate the data skewness is adding other columns to the partition key, so that segment partitioning can be more well balanced. This will corrupt the locality of data so I guess you may need to find a good combination of columns for partition key.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/544644224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/544755506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8647#issuecomment-544755506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8647","id":544755506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDc1NTUwNg==","user":{"login":"leerho","id":12941506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQxNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12941506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho","html_url":"https://github.com/leerho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leerho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T23:54:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T23:55:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Druid team,  can we get some traction on this issue?

Sadly, Druid doesn't support segment pruning in brokers for hash-based partitioning for now (this is supported only for single-dimension range partitioning). That means, even though your segments are partitioned based on the hash value of `tenant_id`, the broker will send queries to all historicals having any segments overlapping with the query interval no matter what their hash value is. I guess, perhaps you could see some performance improvement when you filter on `tenant_id` maybe because of less branch misprediction. Can you share your performance benchmark result if you can?\r\n\r\nI did not get big the performance gain than expected. for the small tenant, the query latency only reduces 50ms-100ms but for the big tenant, the latency increases 10s-30s. I think it caused by the data skewness with the hashed partition of tenant_id. The biggest tenant in an 18GB segment.\r\n\r\n> That means, even though your segments are partitioned based on the hash value of tenant_id, the broker will send queries to all historicals having any segments overlapping with the query interval no matter what their hash value is.\r\n\r\neven though the broker sends queries to all historicals, but only one historical node has the tenant data. So I think the data skewness is the root cause of large latency.\r\n\r\n> Ah, the partitionsSpec you used is the hash-based partitioning. To use the range partitioning, the type of the partitionsSpec should be single_dim instead of hashed. This single-dimension range partitioning is supported only by the hadoop task for now and I believe the native parallel indexing task will support it in the next release.\r\n\r\nDo you mean that druid 0.17.0 will support single-dimension range partitioning in native parallel indexing tasks? \r\nAlso, if there is a big tenant in a range set of tenant_id, how to avoid segment size skewness by single-dimension range partitioning in the future native parallel indexing task?\r\nThanks a

for the detailed information.\r\n\r\nI think `UnionDataSource` should handle this special case which would solve the problem for both `ResultLevelCache` and for users with their own result level cache outside of Druid that are using same protocol.\r\n\r\n`UnionDataSource` should have different `ResponseContext` objects for different queries and merge them into a single [maybe nested] `ResponseContext` object in the end. The merge process creates the `top level Etag = serialize-to-string(array of ETag objects from each query response)`\r\nAlso, If `UnionDataSource` receives `If-None-Match` key in the incoming `ResponseObject` , it should assume that would be a serialized string from array, break it into elements and add to one per datasource query `ResponseObject` it creates. If `If-None-Match` value is not deserializable into string array of size N (number of datasources) then dont use it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/545676670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/545682171","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8583#issuecomment-545682171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8583","id":545682171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTY4MjE3MQ==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T23:46:39Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T23:46:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tan31989 are you still interested in working on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/545682171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/545682441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8727#issuecomment-545682441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8727","id":545682441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTY4MjQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T23:48:02Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T23:48:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@renevan10 this supporting arbitrarily selecting multiple columns to exclude right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/545682441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/545683499","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8727#issuecomment-545683499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8727","id":545683499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTY4MzQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"renevan10","id":19524971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTI0OTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19524971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10","html_url":"https://github.com/renevan10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renevan10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T23:53:44Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T23:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy yes!

We could even get rid of the `put` method and only offer `compute`, to ensure we're always handling this case properly.

@pjain1 !\r\n\r\nBack to the Kafka lag, I have the emitter set to the statsd-emitter sending to dogstatsd (Datadog). I am getting many metrics related to sys, jvm etc. As far as Kafka lag, I only saw druid.coordinator.ingest.kafka.lag, druid.coordinator.ingest.kafka.avglag and druid.coordinator.ingest.kafka.maxlag and since i saw them in datadog metrics explorer it means druid tried to post it at some point, yet there is never any values associated with THESE metrics. You said to expect them as middlemgr metrics but they are not being posted by middlemgr, just coordinator apparently and these are all no value (not even 0). I am running 0.15.1. Any further help would be appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/546131178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
