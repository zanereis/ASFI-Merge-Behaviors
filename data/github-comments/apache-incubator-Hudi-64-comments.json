The overall test time fluctuates with a few min difference. I would pay attention to the module test time printed at the end of the tests.\r\n\r\nThe last 2 success runs ended up with ~9 min for `hudi-utilities`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] hudi-utilities_2.11 ................................ SUCCESS [09:13 min]\r\n[INFO] hudi-utilities_2.11 ................................ SUCCESS [09:07 min]\r\n```\r\n\r\n The [last master build](https://travis-ci.org/github/apache/hudi/jobs/699696974) used almost 11 min for `hudi-utilities`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] hudi-utilities_2.11 ................................ SUCCESS [10:50 min]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso did a text search from the travis logs that the tests included in the functional suite are not found, so they are excluded. By separating a few tests to the functional suite, we started to save time from unit tests execution. Incrementally we'll save more. :) \r\n\r\ncc @n3nash @vinothchandar","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/646396974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/646397724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1748#issuecomment-646397724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1748","id":646397724,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjM5NzcyNA==","user":{"login":"wangxianghu","id":49835526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM1NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49835526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxianghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-19T02:20:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T02:20:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yui2010  checkstyle issue, you can setup your IDE with style files from here : https://hudi.apache.org/contributing#ide-setup","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/646397724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/646398579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/933#issuecomment-646398579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/933","id":646398579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjM5ODU3OQ==","user":{"login":"afeldman1","id":4326577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY1Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1","html_url":"https://github.com/afeldman1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afeldman1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-19T02:23:25Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T02:23:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@vinothchandar Sure, I searched through the wiki (cwiki.apache.org) and the git repo and don't see where the page https://hudi.apache.org/docs/writing_data.html text contents are pulled from.
