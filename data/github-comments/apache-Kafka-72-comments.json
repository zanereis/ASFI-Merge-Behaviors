by @gfodor @ijuma @junrao @aartigupta. Changes include:\n1. Reduce number of `time.millisecond` calls in run-loop.\n2. Not recording if polling with zero only.\n3. Use `time.milliseconds` instead of `time.nanoseconds` for state metrics recording, and also fixed a bug with the recording.\n\n@gfodor Could you apply this patch and see if it reduced CPU overhead? One note is that if your traffic is very small and consumer is already at the log tail throughout your test, it will cause the polling / processing to be called with less batched data and hence further increased overhead.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225277148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225284248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1488#issuecomment-225284248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1488","id":225284248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTI4NDI0OA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T20:14:38Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T20:14:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @jklukas , merged to trunk and 0.10.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225284248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225292377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1486#issuecomment-225292377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1486","id":225292377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTI5MjM3Nw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T20:51:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T20:51:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"btw I think I have seen this test case stalled once before already:\n\n```\n\nkafka.integration.SaslSslTopicMetadataTest > testIsrAfterBrokerShutDownAndJoinsBack STARTED\nBuild timed out (after 120 minutes).

The consumer has traditionally supported the ability to be started before any producers and that means retrying on unknown topics. Even if we had some way to inspect whether autocreate has been disabled, we probably still have to support this for compatibility. I'm also thinking about the impact of the CreateTopic API in KIP-4 (which is under discussion right now). The most likely eventual outcome is that autocreation will be taken out of the broker and pushed into the producer, so it seems that the picture doesn't really change for the consumer, but we should consider whether this outcome is ideal.\n\nOne option for the problem at hand is to keep the current behavior (i.e. do nothing). Users can use the `partitionsFor()` API to verify the existence of any needed topics and raise an exception themselves if they expect it to exist ahead of time. Alternatively, we would probably need a separate configuration that lets the consumer raise an exception instead of retrying. This would call for a new KIP. Topic deletion may be an interesting case to think about as well since the `partitionsFor` workaround may not help (I'm not too sure).\n\nAll that said, I don't think we need to block this issue on a resolution to that problem. It doesn't seem like a big difference to me whether we retry indefinitely because the user is not authorized to the topic or because we are waiting for a topic that may never be created. In either case, the user ultimately has to monitor the progress of the application and take steps when it is failing or falling behind.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225772582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225776448","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1498#issuecomment-225776448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1498","id":225776448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTc3NjQ0OA==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T04:22:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T04:22:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225776448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/225804944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1428#issuecomment-225804944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1428","id":225804944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTgwNDk0NA==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-14T07:48:47Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T07:48:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My concern is that configuring security is challenging enough as it is. Configuring authorization incorrectly is very common and harder to diagnose than a topic that hasn't been created (even the latter sometimes causes people to be confused and waste time).\n\nReplacing an exception with indefinite blocking is making the user experience during development even worse than it is at the moment (which is already suboptimal in a number of situations).
