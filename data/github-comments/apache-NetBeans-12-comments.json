As correctly observed by Jan, the build fails due to cyclic references. I could probably fix them by moving some tests from `nbjunit` to `openide.util.lookup`, but then I got a better idea: let's fix two issues at once!\r\n\r\n1. build should build code & tests\r\n2. there should be `ant build` target in module projects\r\n\r\nIt is very unusual that the Ant harness module `build.xml` files don't have `build` target and one has to use `ant netbeans` instead. I can fix it as well as fix the build of tests:\r\n\r\n1. let's add `<target name=\"build\" depends=\"netbeans,test-build\"/>` into `common.xml`\r\n2. let's modify default targets of all modules in the `incubator-netbeans` repository to call `build`\r\n2.a should there be any problem, people can change it back to `netbeans`\r\n3. make sure build from the IDE calls `build` and not `netbeans`\r\n\r\nThis seems like more compatible and less drastic change which achieves the same thing: developers working on their own modules compile their code as well as tests.\r\n\r\nI was silent for a while as I was unsure whether this proposal is good, but I still (even after two weeks) think it is... Shall I implement it?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/370523446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/370568774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/439#issuecomment-370568774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/439","id":370568774,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDU2ODc3NA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T21:17:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T21:17:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Makes sense to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/370568774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/370672446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/439#issuecomment-370672446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/439","id":370672446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDY3MjQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"jlahoda","id":124144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda","html_url":"https://github.com/jlahoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlahoda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T05:56:18Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T05:56:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One note: it would be better to change the version in the binaries to 10.

The VCS log should be enough, and tests should help as well.\r\n-there should be a (unit) test. Tests by default run with nb-javac, and nb-javac supports vars, so this should be doable, even when running the tests with JDK 8. The test may refer to the Jira #, so that if it fails, one can find out the original report.\r\n-please avoid looking at the text as much as possible - such things are quite fragile (e.g., what if someone writes \"var/**/ v = 1;\"? Not sure if the fact that the variable is a \"var\" can be detected from the AST, maybe not. But it should be possible to use lexer tokens to check for \"var\", something like CompilationInfo.getTreeUtilities().tokensFor(VariableTree) and then check the appropriate token. Please note that things like this are allowed:\r\n        final var v1 = 0;\r\n        @Deprecated var v2 = 1;\r\nSo I'd suggest to move the token sequence behind the modifiers, ignore whitespaces/comments and check the following token.\r\n-I'd suggest to do an API method for this check in TreeUtilities. I suspect this check will be needed on more places, so better not to duplicate it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/373312737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/373316782","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/453#issuecomment-373316782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/453","id":373316782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MzMxNjc4Mg==","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-15T09:40:46Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T09:40:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I haven't checked, but VariableTree.type's position may be -1 in this case.

If the user did include braces then they are preserved.\r\n\r\nIf user enables the existing remove braces option then reformatting will remove the \"extra\" braces around some try/synchronized statements, however since it also removes them from conditionals with single statement bodies it is probably not a widely used option and those who use it must really hate braces.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/373874726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/373974157","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/459#issuecomment-373974157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/459","id":373974157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mzk3NDE1Nw==","user":{"login":"jtulach","id":1842422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1842422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach","html_url":"https://github.com/jtulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-18T05:29:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T05:34:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1, but please squash the commits into one.

Some initial comments:\r\n-please note that every occurrence of @Hint means a separate \"hint\" and a separate entry in Tools/Options/Editor/Hints. I think there should only be a single @Hint for this (on the class), which means a single hint/single configuration entry, and then there can be any number of @Trigger methods inside the class that will all work for that single hint. Some conversion may be seen undesirable (worsening readability), so it might be desirable to allow disabling the conversion in some contexts, although I am not sure offhand for which it should be. Defining simple boolean options should be simple, see @BooleanOption, e.g. in: java.hints/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/hints/perf/SizeEqualsZero.java\r\n-please note that @Hint has minSourceVersion that can be used to specify minimal -source version for the hint. But even if that didn't work in a particular case, there is CompilationInfo.getSourceVersion(), which should be used instead of SourceLevelQuery in hints.\r\n-category = \"suggestions\" -> category = \"rules15\" (the category name is confusing, but it is not easy to change; this will be under \"JDK Migration Support\")\r\n-I wonder if the hint shouldn't have simply @TriggerTreeKind(VARIABLE) or @TriggerPattern(\"$mods$ $type $var =new $init;\") and then internally trying to figure out if the variable can be var or not. (Also please note there will soon be an API method to check if a variable is \"var\" or not that the hint will be able to use.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/376060393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/376267944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/464#issuecomment-376267944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/464","id":376267944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjI2Nzk0NA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T18:36:12Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T18:36:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks
