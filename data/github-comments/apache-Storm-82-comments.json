Does the wildcard feature means: \"user passes a wildcard string in config (e.g., '^WordCount'), then the KafkaSpout may find multiple matching topics, thus multiple streams need to be constructed for reading messages from Kafka's multiple topics.\"   ?<br/>\nb. If <a> is what is described in this issue, does it have any real use cases?<br/>\nc. Or you mean a WildcardTopicSelector to choose among multiple matching topics (then finally choose one of them for data input)?<br/>\nThanks.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612546219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612546220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4658#issuecomment-2612546220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4658","id":2612546220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1NDYyMjA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-21T18:55:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:34:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sumitkchawla\">sumitkchawla</a>:</i>\n<p>Hi Zhuo</p>\n\n<p>My use case matches \"a\".  We have multiple topics separated by tenant namespaces.  We want to be able to run a aggregation stream for data coming from all tenants. Tenants get added dynamically.  So new kafka topics get created.  All the topics will be matching a regex pattern. <br/>\n example:<br/>\n     clickstream:tenant1:log<br/>\n     clickstream:tenant2:log<br/>\n     clickstream:tenant3:log</p>\n\n<p>Storm code should be able to perform auto-discovery, and should be able to to fetch from newly created topics in run time.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think will be the size of this effort?  I am also willing to put in sometime in feature.

topics</p>\n\n<p>    Support for Wildcard match of topics based on Config - \"kafka.topic.wildcard.match\".  If this config is specified then Topics matching the pattern are picked for listening to messages.  </p>\n\n<p>    Implementation Details:<br/>\n      1.  DynamicBrokerReader now returns a list of GlobalPartitionInformation.  Each object is tied to a topic. <br/>\n      2.  Partition object now has a topic.  Each parition belongs to a specific topic<br/>\n      3.  DynamicPartitonConnections keeps a map of topic_partiton registration<br/>\n      4.  Kafka Metrics are written per topic.<br/>\n      5.  PartitionManager uses Partition.topic for calculating commit path.  Commit path for wildcard topic scenario will be  _spoutConfig.id/topic_ABC/partition_0;  For non-wildcard use, the path will be _spoutConfig.id/partition_0.  This way the change is backward compatible with previously committed ZK offsets.<br/>\n    6.  New Test case DynamicBrokerReaderTests. testGetBrokerInfoWildcardMatch for testing topic discovery.</p>\n\n<p>    7.  Manually tested Kafka Single Topic, Wildcard topics, Trident Topic, Wildcard topics.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a
