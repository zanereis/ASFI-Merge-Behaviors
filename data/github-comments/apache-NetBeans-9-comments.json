In this case I see the commits are an evolution of the patch, not meaningful entities in themselves and so the squash would be the right thing.\r\n\r\nThere are two options:\r\n\r\n1. Use git cli: You can switch to the isssue-210 branch, rewrite history (squash the entries) and do a force push, that will update this PR and you can then locally merge and push master. Github recognises, that the two commits match and will close this PR automatically.\r\n2. Use the Web-GUI - in this PR you can choose \"Merge pull request\" (this will use your commits as is) or \"Squash and merge\" (this will squash the 4 commits into one and merge it to master). The latter would be the advised option.\r\n\r\nThank

Presumably you would need to add `SplitDocumentHorizontallyAction` and `SplitDocumentVerticallyAction` nested classes so that you could add the specific `@ActionID`, `@ActionRegistration`, and `@ActionReference` annotations. Then, once you have done this and verified that you are able to invoke the actions via the keyboard shortcuts, the second commit would be a simple refactoring that would move the `ClearSplitAction`, `SplitDocumentAction`, `SplitDocumentHorizontallyAction`, and `SplitDocumentVerticallyAction` nested classes to top-level classes within the `org.netbeans.core.multiview.actions` package.\r\n\r\nOne subtle issue is that moving message strings LBL_ClearSplitAction, LBL_ValueClearSplit, LBL_SplitDocumentActionHorizontal, LBL_ValueSplitHorizontal, LBL_SplitDocumentActionVertical, LBL_ValueSplitVertical to a different package (from `org.netbeans.core.multiview` to `org.netbeans.core.multiview.actions`) will break existing translations of these strings. For example, there are Czech translations at https://netbeans.org/projects/nblocalization/downloads/directory/8.0.2 which would no longer work. Maybe these message strings could be kept within the `org.netbeans.core.multiview` package and the relocated `ClearSplitAction`, etc. could refer to `org.netbeans.core.multiview.Bundle` for these strings. Or, maybe it's fine to move the strings to the different package.

Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n  * Changing\r\n\r\n    ```java\r\n    fireProgressListenerStart(0, COMMIT_STEPS + commits.size() * COMMIT_STEPS + 1);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    to:\r\n\r\n    ```java\r\n    {\r\n        int count = COMMIT_STEPS + commits.size() * COMMIT_STEPS + 1;\r\n        fireProgressListenerStart(0, count);\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    and the other similar changes are unnecessary, in my opinion. I like the introduction of a variable for the result of DataObject.getRegistry().getModified() because it was unclear that this has type `DataObject[]` instead of some type of `Iterable`; but, other introduced variables seem unnecessary.\r\n  * I don't think that reallyDoRefactoring() and reallyUndoRefactoring() should be inlined. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the reason why you did this. However, I think that the original pattern should be kept, as it is a perfectly acceptable pattern to use.\r\n  * `Arrays.asList(...).stream()` can be replaced with `Stream.of(...)`.\r\n  * With the exception of the JavaDoc comment on performChange(), I think that the other new comments are unnecessary and should be removed.\r\n\r\nOne final thought: I think that commit messages should not be cutesy or contain jokes (e.g. \"against the order of maw\") because the developers working on this project come from different backgrounds and may not get all of the references. I had to search \"order of maw\" to figure out that it is a Warcraft reference (I think? still not sure...).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/357448838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/357449463","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/314#issuecomment-357449463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/314","id":357449463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzQ0OTQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-13T16:56:23Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T17:03:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello @vieiro,\r\n\r\nThe \"Code cleanup\" label is not appropriate for this PR.
