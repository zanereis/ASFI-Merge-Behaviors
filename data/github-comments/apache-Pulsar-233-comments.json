It's a bit complicated because it involves having a python package which requires another python package.\r\n\r\nBasically it seems the problem is that in version 4.11.0 of `apache-bookkeeper-client` there was an explicit requirement added: `grpcio<1.26.0`, while in 4.10.0 this was only `>=1.8.2`. Since pulsar-client itself requires `grpcio`, but does not specify a version, pip installs the newest (maybe the solution is removing this dependency?).\r\n\r\nSetuptools verifies all the dependencies of my python package and throws this error.\r\n\r\nI temporarily solved it by explicitly adding `grpcio==1.25.0` in my requirements.txt.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/659460179/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/659463151","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7430#issuecomment-659463151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7430","id":659463151,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTQ2MzE1MQ==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-16T14:50:04Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T14:50:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/659463151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/659727667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7539#issuecomment-659727667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7539","id":659727667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1OTcyNzY2Nw==","user":{"login":"devinbost","id":7418031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTgwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost","html_url":"https://github.com/devinbost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-16T23:15:20Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T23:15:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vzhikserg This is great!
