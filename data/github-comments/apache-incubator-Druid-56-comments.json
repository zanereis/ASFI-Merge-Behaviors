 @michaelschiff  from #2256 its not clear what scenario is broken and getting fixed with this, is there a use case (in ingestion, querying etc) where merge(..) would get called with metricAggs having more than what individual indexes

I encountered this while working on a streaming, micro-batch indexer, however I see this as a general improvement of schema backwards compatibility. My indexer is built around incremental segment construction, with no window period. To accomplish this I make use of IndexMerger.merge(). I feel like ideally, one should not need to know the exact set of metrics in the indices that are being mergred, or at least should be able to use the latest schema version (which is what my indexer does). This PR allows for the scenario where your schema has grown and you are requesting to merge more metrics than are actually present. The case where there are more metrics present in the indices to merge than were requested is still an exception. \n\nIf there is disagreement over whether requesting to merge more metrics than are present should be acceptable, this PR can easily be modified to detect this condition and throw a descriptive error, instead of the NullPointerException that currently occurs. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172454229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172464064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2281#issuecomment-172464064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2281","id":172464064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjQ2NDA2NA==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T08:44:12Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T08:44:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":+1:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172464064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172468177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2166#issuecomment-172468177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2166","id":172468177,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjQ2ODE3Nw==","user":{"login":"steventranjs","id":6488765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODg3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6488765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs","html_url":"https://github.com/steventranjs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steventranjs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T09:01:25Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T09:01:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @fjy yes, this is exactly what I want.

I believe the use case you are describing is already supported by Druid. Can you double check this?\n\nTry this query:\n\n```\n{\n  \"queryType\": \"topN\",\n  \"dataSource\": \"dataSource\",\n  \"dimension\": \"query\",\n  \"metric\": \"pv\",\n  \"threshold\": 10,\n  \"granularity\": \"day\",\n  \"postAggregations\": [],\n  \"aggregations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"pv\",\n      \"fieldName\": \"pv\",\n      \"type\": \"longSum\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"uv\",\n      \"fieldName\": \"user_id_sketch\",\n      \"type\": \"thetaSketch\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"intervals\":[\"2015-01-01/2100-01-01\"]\n}\n```\n\nIssue your query with the context flag \"doAggregateTopNMetricFirst\": true\n\nThis should do the same thing as what your PR is describing this code doing. I think this context flag may have gone undocumented.\n\nI think you may get the same performance, in which case, the optimization here may not be needed, and what is needed is to document that flag :)\n\nIt might also be useful to have a more automatic way of triggering this optimization rather than using the flag.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172674271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172696458","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2286#issuecomment-172696458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2286","id":172696458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjY5NjQ1OA==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T01:08:42Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T01:08:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nishantmonu51 this is the core part of what I was speaking to you about the other day\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172696458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/172697272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2286#issuecomment-172697272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2286","id":172697272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjY5NzI3Mg==","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T01:15:33Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T01:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cheddar / @b-slim I was planning on using this to communicate namespace lookups around to the cluster.
