I don't feel it will be good to introduce some complex logic that will depend on exact `DbVersion`. Cayenne now have 12 DbAdapters and it can easily become unmanageable in the future.\r\n\r\nSo it may be better to start with simple per-adapter `PkGenerator` binding ([PerAdapterProvider<T>](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/blob/master/cayenne-server/src/main/java/org/apache/cayenne/dba/PerAdapterProvider.java) can help with that). And leave customization up to user (this is a general approach in Cayenne, as I see it)\r\n\r\nI.e. we'll be able to use non-default (provided by Cayenne or by user) `PkGenerator` like this:\r\n```\r\nServerRuntimeBuilder\r\n    .addModule(binder -> \r\n        ServerModule.contributePkGenerators(binder)\r\n            .put(SQLServerAdapter.class.getName(), SQLServerPkGenerator.class))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there is also one technical aspect that should be taken into account. [Here](https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/277/files#diff-55d57dd56ccf4d7edb4ccf18f342e171R70) `AdhocObjectFactory` should be used to instantiate PkGenerator, otherwise OSGI-like environments can be broken. I believe this will require some PkGenerators refactoring, to enable default constructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/372594036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/372753059","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/277#issuecomment-372753059","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/277","id":372753059,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjc1MzA1OQ==","user":{"login":"PRIESt512","id":9308370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDgzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9308370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512","html_url":"https://github.com/PRIESt512","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PRIESt512/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-13T17:36:45Z","updated_at":"2018-03-13T17:36:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@stariy95  Good remarks! I'll make changes to the code! Originally I planned to do the `PkGenerator` using `AdhocObjectFactory`. However, I was not sure that I had the right to make such changes. Therefore I decided to choose the maximum compatibility with the old code. But I have a question, but how will the choice of a specific `PkGenerator` in the CayenneModeler occur then? Will you need to add new functionality? So I tried to make an automatic choice. If it is necessary, I will study the CayenneModeler code with interest and try to add a choice.

Some paths are in the data store so I can filter at the time I query. Some paths address fields in the java object though and thus need to be filtered in memory after the fetch. So I have a transformer that produces two expressions: one to include in the fetch and one afterward. There’s a little more to that too, but the point is that when the transformer encounters a condition nodes to prune out, it returns PRUNED_NODE. That line I changed doesn’t work then because the cast to Expression fails since the PRUNED_NODE constant is just an object and not an Expression.

With these changes, the default project version will be overriden only if a supported project version greater than that is encountered while parsing a project xml file.\r\n\r\n_Project and Schema Versioning_\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I am a little unclear on what the project version is actually supposed to represent. In each xsd file, there is a project version attribute and a namespace url. The namespace url is comprised of the same value that the project version attribute is set to and in turn, the schema files are contained in a directory cooresponding to the project version they are supposed to be used with.\r\n\r\nIn following this line of reasoning, allowing multiple project versions means that a namespace can't necessarily be known before a project xml file is read, so these changes attempt to generate one from the project version once it is known. Then the `VersionAwareHandler` is able to properly validate the project version is both supported by the framework and compatible with the cooresponding schema namespace as specified in the project xml (which right now just means its versioned the same).\r\n\r\nGiven these existing semantics, if there is a breaking modification in one xsd file that would require a bump to the project version, then all other unmodified schema files would necessarily have to have their versions be bumped as well (or at least duplicated, bumped and placed in a new version directory).\r\n\r\nI've tried to stay away from that, I've never been a fan of bumping versions in things that don't actually change... in doing so, I ended up with a project file that has a project version attribute set to 11 that references map files with project versions set to 10. It works but I have to admit that this is certainly not right...\r\n\r\nI propose allowing the xsd schema files to have versions independent of the project version (i.e. a given project version would indicate compatibility with a given set of schema versions - project-version 11 uses domain.xsd version 11 and modelMap.xsd version 10). But beofre I went there, I was hoping for a little feedback...

At the moment (and I may be wrong about this), the only way to specify this property is via the command line when invoking maven; it is not configurable from within the `pom.xml` file, at least not that I’ve been able to figure out.\n\nIf the concern is to prevent opening up the ability to arbitrarily set system properties, then perhaps we can specify the value of that property explicitly as a cgen configuration parameter (e.g. `additionalToolConfig`) and have the plugin set only the required velocity property. That way it doesn’t open up the possibility of setting arbitrary properties. \n\nIn any case, I can live with the inconvenience of specifying the command line switch if needed.

It is needed in the constructor, however the configuration is not supplied until after the constructor is invoked (in `DefaultClassGenerationActionFactory`). This means I have to delay the velocity context creation in `ClassGenerationAction` until the `resetContextForArtifact(Artifact)` method is called. It works, but it obviously introduces a risk.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of alternatives to this approach, but both have trade offs:\r\n\r\n1. Add `CgenConfiguration` as a parameter to `ClassGenerationAction`’s constructor and alter the `DefaultClassGenerationActionFactory` to supply the configuration during construction. That would allow the velocity context to be created where it currently is, in `ClassGenerationAction`’s constructor. This results in an API change for `ClassGenerationAction`'s constructor, however the constructor is only called from the `DefaultClassGenerationActionFactory` (the `CgenConfiguration` is already passed in to its `createAction` factory method as an argument). It would be a simple change to instantiate the action with the cgen configuration as argument rather than setting it immediately afterwards. Regardless, this may not be a desirable approach due to API change.\r\n\r\n2. The other alternative is to leave all the code in `ClassGenerationAction` unchanged, and instead explicitly set **only** the `org.apache.velocity.tools` system property in the maven plugin if the `externalToolConfig` configuration is set. Obviously, this means that it would have to set a system property, however the upside is that it is limited in scope to the maven plugin and only one specific system property is set. The existing cgen code is unchanged (with the exception of CgenConfiguration of course).\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your thoughts on this as I don’t want to commit something that goes against your vision for Cayenne. My personal preference is for alternative 2, however I understand that is an approach you were trying to avoid. After that, I would prefer the scheme of lazily creating the context.  If none of the three options is suitable, then I have no problem shelving this and maintaining something locally in my own project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/625968759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/comments/626645989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cayenne/pull/421#issuecomment-626645989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cayenne/issues/421","id":626645989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNjY0NTk4OQ==","user":{"login":"stariy95","id":5188210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODgyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5188210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95","html_url":"https://github.com/stariy95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stariy95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-11T11:30:48Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T11:30:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@faizel I'm ok with the 1st option.
