First of all, the function I called in that example is a very inaccurate total estimation of all memory on all GPU cards. Then there are several layer of things going on. For example, Python GC (though it is ref-counter based, so should be relative immediate), and MXNet has internal memory pool that tries to minimize calling to CUDA allocation API by retaining some memory and re-using them.\n\nI think maybe the best way to test the memory usage (in case the result from `get_cost` should be verified empirically) is simply try to add up layers and see how deep you can go before your program crashes with out-of-memory error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215709277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/215718207","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1985#issuecomment-215718207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1985","id":215718207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTcxODIwNw==","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-29T13:49:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T13:49:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rldotai Thanks for spotting this bug!

I think the latest releases don't include the test app. We have moved to MxNet.cpp for the cpp examples.\n\nRegarding to the header file problem, remember to select x64 as the platform. We didn't set the compiler flags in x86 mode, so it lacks flags like DMLC_USE_CUDA, which would lead to the error.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/216421517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/216424430","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1746#issuecomment-216424430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1746","id":216424430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjQyNDQzMA==","user":{"login":"tornadomeet","id":5860892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjA4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5860892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet","html_url":"https://github.com/tornadomeet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tornadomeet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T02:59:46Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T02:59:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Starting as a normal operator with variable argument number, a smooth l1 loss operator is presented. Then it is reformatted as a binary operator, utilizing the uniform operator framework.
