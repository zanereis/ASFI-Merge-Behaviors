also meet the same problem.  My consumer seems like not stopped  , but it refuse consme data . In my scenario ,  I have a topic ( vacc_top )  with   48 messageQueues  among 3 brokers , I found that it stopped consume in mq4  which  reside in  broker-a . But the consumer has not stopped , I send a message to the topic by mq-console , it works normal . It just  delays some messages  .  When I restart my application or start a new consumer   the delay disappear  and everything is fine .   \r\n\r\nIn my opinion , it seems like the MQ-PullRequest exit by some reason so the mq cannot be consumed .  I debugged the consumer code , I found the code below in   DefaultMQPushConsumerImpl \r\n\r\n` if (processQueue.isDropped()) {\r\n            log.info(\"the pull request[{}] is dropped.\", pullRequest.toString());\r\n            return;\r\n        }`\r\n  \r\n`  if (pullResult.getNextBeginOffset() < prevRequestOffset\r\n                                || firstMsgOffset < prevRequestOffset) {\r\n                                log.warn(\r\n                                    \"[BUG] pull message result maybe data wrong, nextBeginOffset: {} firstMsgOffset: {} prevRequestOffset: {}\",\r\n                                    pullResult.getNextBeginOffset(),\r\n                                    firstMsgOffset,\r\n                                    prevRequestOffset);\r\n                            }`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems that : \r\n1 , the processQueue is stopped (  perhaps because of expired , when doRebalance  rocketmq will evaluate the last pull timestamp of the processqueue  to decide  weather to expir the processqueue )  so the mq stop consume . \r\n2 , the pullRequest get wrong offset from broker ( the next pull offset from the pullResult  is   less than the  previous pull offset)  , so the  pullRequest exit .  \r\n\r\nAs everything become ok after I restart my consumer , so I prefer the first reason . \r\nI will inspect my log carefully and hope  my case will be helpful . \r\nThanks . \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/612447520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/612559573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1926#issuecomment-612559573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1926","id":612559573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjU1OTU3Mw==","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-12T03:46:21Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T03:46:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please give an English description of this pr and related issues' content.  @jianglianggithub ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/612559573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/612559888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/1920#issuecomment-612559888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1920","id":612559888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjU1OTg4OA==","user":{"login":"zongtanghu","id":5010883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu","html_url":"https://github.com/zongtanghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zongtanghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-12T03:49:53Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T03:49:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good job!
