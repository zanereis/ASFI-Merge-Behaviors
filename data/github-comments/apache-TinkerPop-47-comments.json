Its a good idea to expose a `Symbol.asyncIterator` method.\r\n\r\nWe must support Node.js 6 and 8 runtimes, that don't expose `Symbol.asyncIterator`.\r\nYou can fix it by define it conditionally:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst asyncIteratorSymbol = Symbol.asyncIterator || Symbol('@@asyncIterator');\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n  [asyncIteratorSymbol]() {\r\n    // This wont work for Node.js 6 and 8, but at least the method will be exposed\r\n    // under symbol name\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice it we could add a [unit test](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/gremlin-javascript/src/main/javascript/gremlin-javascript/test/unit/traversal-test.js) validating that `Symbol.asyncIterator` is defined for a `Traversal` instance:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif (Symbol.asyncIterator) {\r\n  describe('@@iterator', () => {\r\n    it('should expose the async iterator');\r\n

Any reason we need a [specific build](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/.travis.yml#L35) for `gremlin-javascript` then? seems like we could just rely on the regular `mvn clean install` build, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/466988053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/467021766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1065#issuecomment-467021766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1065","id":467021766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzAyMTc2Ng==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T14:02:03Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T14:02:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks fine though we usually reference the JIRA at the end of the description of the change:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSee: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1774[TINKERPOP-1774]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/467021766/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/467152417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1070#issuecomment-467152417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1070","id":467152417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzE1MjQxNw==","user":{"login":"fdominik","id":13556962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTU2OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13556962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik","html_url":"https://github.com/fdominik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdominik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-25T19:38:25Z","updated_at":"2019-02-25T19:38:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@spmallette yeah I've noticed that, I tried to solve, it didn't help.

- sorry it took me some time to come back to this. if the problem is with `package.json` then i think it's likely that your problem is related to the fact that we generate `package.json` from:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3c87b3a99b5182b9c1dc245d474def1662bae68f/gremlin-javascript/glv/PackageJson.template\r\n\r\nThat generation is triggered by a maven command so that's probably why maven builds in Travis are having trouble. Hopefully, that solves your problem. \r\n\r\nAs far as other issues go, I'll largely defer to @jorgebay and @jbmusso but I think that administratively, it would be nice to have an entry added in CHANGELOG for 3.4.1:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3c87b3a99b5182b9c1dc245d474def1662bae68f/CHANGELOG.asciidoc\r\n\r\nand if you want to really polish this up, then you would want to add a section to our \"Upgrade Documentation\":\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3c87b3a99b5182b9c1dc245d474def1662bae68f/docs/src/upgrade/release-3.4.x.asciidoc\r\n\r\nspecifically, a subsection to an \"Upgrading for Users\" for 3.4.1. This change seems interesting enough that users would want to know about it.\r\n\r\nanyway, let's see if your build problem gets resolved on Travis and then we can resume the review process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/468352633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/468594110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1071#issuecomment-468594110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1071","id":468594110,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODU5NDExMA==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-01T09:02:12Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T09:02:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@spmallette

This would have two nice advantages for us right now:\r\n\r\n1. We don't have to iterate over all connections and find the least used one. Instead, we can simply dequeue/enqueue connections and use the first that hasn't reached it's limit. This is effectively a round-robin mechanism which is probably more efficient than our current approach.\r\n2. Removal of a closed connection would be as simple as not enqueueing it again during this process.\r\n\r\nWould be good to hear your opinion on that.\r\n\r\nWhat's the advantage of such a custom copy-on-write list? Only avoiding the expensive `Count` implementation of `ConcurrentDictionary`? That seems to be at least less expensive for [`ConcurrentQueue`](https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/blob/3b1eaf5203992df69de44c783a3eda37d3d4cd10/mscorlib/system/collections/Concurrent/ConcurrentQueue.cs#L394). But we would probably have to maintain our own connection counter if we moved to such a dequeue/enqueue approach as that would change the count all the time.\r\n\r\nIn general, I would prefer if we could stick with the default collection types if possible and only add our own types if we really have to.\r\n\r\n> To ensure that concurrent modifications to the pool don't occur, e.g., pool growing and closing, we could use something like a ordered task scheduler.\r\n\r\nI also thought about how we could prevent that, but I wanted to postpone it to a subsequent PR. A task scheduler sounds like a good solution in general. Do you know whether the default [TaskScheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler) would work here? I haven't worked with that yet myself.\r\nWith a task scheduler we would probably only have to change the way we replace dead connections. Currently, all connections are removed from the pool if a request fails due to a network error and new connections are created the next time a connection is needed. That would not work anymore if a scheduled task is used to create new connections as we probably can't really wait for that (?)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/469659360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/470081089","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1078#issuecomment-470081089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1078","id":470081089,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MDA4MTA4OQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-06T11:58:18Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T11:58:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for this - I've cherry-picked your work to #1079 which changed the target branch and fixed up a a couple other things.

Effectively what you get is a moment-in-time view of the collection, you don't have to add special conditions to track concurrent changes.\r\n\r\nAbout using a queue, IMO we shouldn't rely on that sort of behaviour here (I think we discussed a similar queue approach for the pool in https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/903):\r\n- We should support concurrent writes to the connection, if we queue it and dequeue it, we might end up with an empty pool (at a certain time). We might need complicated logic to guard for that.\r\n- Using a enqueuing/dequeueing from a concurrent queue is not a cheap operation when multiple threads are accessing to it.

For `ConcurrentDictionary` it seems to include modifications, but for `ConcurrentQueue` not ([Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentqueue-1.getenumerator?view=netframework-4.7.2#remarks)):\r\n\r\n> The enumeration represents a moment-in-time snapshot of the contents of the queue. It does not reflect any updates to the collection after GetEnumerator was called. The enumerator is safe to use concurrently with reads from and writes to the queue.\r\n\r\nI understand your reasoning though for a custom copy-on-write list now like the one you linked in the DataStax Cassandra driver.\r\nYour suggestion of replacing the current `SelectUsedConnection` method with such a round-robin mechanism also makes sense to me. We would get the same benefit as with the enqueue/dequeue mechanism but without the disadvantages you mentioned (possibility to get an empty pool and more expensive operations).\r\nYou already suggested that in #903, but I wanted to avoid adding too much complexity there at once and the approach in `SelectUsedConnection` seemed a lot simpler to me at that time. But now that we have a first version of request pipelining working, I think that it makes sense to add this now as an incremental improvement.\r\n\r\n> If we need to compare the one with least in-flight requests, we should minimize the amount of checks, for example check connections at index and index+1, instead of checking the whole list (O(2) vs O(n))\r\n\r\nJust to make sure that I understand your proposal here correctly: You mean that we would just select the next connection via round-robin and then verify whether it has less than the maximum number of connections and continue these two steps until we have a connection that is below the limit, right? That should usually finish in the first iteration I guess.\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions here again so far, @jorgebay! I will give this a try and then update this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm just not sure about the task scheduler yet. That sounds like a good idea, but it also adds quite some complexity. So it could make sense to postpone that for 3.4.2.

This means that we now only make small changes and mainly keep the release branches as is so they can be reviewed and tested for the release. We can make exceptions to this policy for very small changes or for pull requests that were already open on Friday and which we can close shortly.\r\nBased on this, I think that our options here are:\r\n\r\n1. Combine both pull requests, but merge them only after the 3.4.1 release since your PR is too big of a change to be merged during code freeze.\r\n2. Merge this PR without bigger modifications and apply other changes after the 3.4.1 release with follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\nI tend towards option 2 here, because I would like to close TINKERPOP-2135 and TINKERPOP-2148 for this release and I don't think that we can make bigger changes to this PR and still merge it during code freeze.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think it would good if you could split your PR into multiple smaller ones that address ideally only one issue each. Some of the improvements you suggest are obvious improvements, but others will probably require some discussion. For example, [we decided earlier](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/903#issuecomment-420292652) that we don't want to wait for a connection to become available with a timeout and instead fail fast by throwing an exception if no connection is available. I'm not saying that we have to stick with this decision if you have good arguments against it, but this will require some discussion.\r\nIf you [create issues in JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TINKERPOP/issues) first for these issues that you want to fix/improve, then we can also discuss about them first in general before you put in the work to create a dedicated PR for the issue.\r\nI think that it would be easier and more efficient to apply your improvements like this, but we could of course also review your PR at once if you prefer it that way. That will however most likely result in a big review with quite a few iterations until it's in a state where we can merge it.\r\n\r\n@jorgebay: Do you agree?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/471467709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/471475066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1077#issuecomment-471475066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1077","id":471475066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTQ3NTA2Ng==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-11T09:58:00Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T09:58:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking

Or is this more decided on a per language/variant basis?\r\n\r\nIt's more the latter. Since C# is in general quite similar to Java and because the Java driver was the first one and is probably still the most advanced one, we often use that driver as kind of a reference for the .NET driver. But on the other hand we also don't copy everything from the Java driver. I especially tried to avoid some of the complexities of the Java driver where I didn't see a need yet to introduce them.\r\nSo, long story short: The development of the drivers is independent for the different languages, but where it makes sense to copy the Java driver, we do that to make it easier to switch between languages, especially for contributors.\r\n\r\n@jorgebay Will you have the time to

I suddenly didn't understand why the query in question:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ng.V().\r\n  project('v','edges').\r\n  by(valueMap()).\r\n  by(outE().valueMap().fold())\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom https://stackoverflow.com/q/55571767/1831717\r\n\r\nproduces a `Set` for `SetIO` to be the source of this problem. So I tested the traversal in the Console:\r\n\r\n```text\r\ngremlin> x = g.V().store('vertices').by(valueMap()).\r\n......1>   outE().store('edges').by(valueMap()).\r\n......2>   cap('vertices','edges').next()\r\n==>vertices={{name=[marko], age=[29]}=1, {name=[vadas], age=[27]}=1, {name=[lop], lang=[java]}=1, {name=[josh], age=[32]}=1, {name=[ripple], lang=[java]}=1, {name=[peter], age=[35]}=1}\r\n==>edges={{weight=0.4}=2, {weight=0.5}=1, {weight=1.0}=2, {weight=0.2}=1}\r\ngremlin> x.getClass()\r\n==>class java.util.HashMap\r\ngremlin> x.vertices.class\r\n==>class org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.step.util.BulkSet\r\ngremlin> x.vertices[0].getClass()\r\n==>class java.util.HashMap\r\ngremlin> x.vertices[0].age.class\r\n==>class java.util.ArrayList\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only collection that is `Set` based is \"vertices\" and \"edges\" keys which are `BulkSet`. The 3.3.x line of code does not have support for this `BulkSet` type - this was rectified in 3.4.0:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.4.1/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#tinkerpop-340-release-date-january-2-2019\r\n\r\nSo, technically the issue is resolved by 3.4.0+ but would require that you and Neptune both use this newer version.  I did come up with a workaround if to transform the `BulkSet` with Gremlin:\r\n\r\n```text\r\ngremlin> x = g.V().store('vertices').by(valueMap()).\r\n......1>   outE().store('edges').by(valueMap()).\r\n......2>   cap('vertices','edges').\r\n......3>   select('vertices','edges').\r\n......4>     by(unfold().fold()).toList()\r\n==>[vertices:[[name:[marko],age:[29]],[name:[vadas],age:[27]],[name:[lop],lang:[java]],[name:[josh],age:[32]],[name:[ripple],lang:[java]],[name:[peter],age:[35]]],edges:[[weight:0.4],[weight:0.4],[weight:0.5],[weight:1.0],[weight:1.0],[weight:0.2]]]\r\ngremlin> x.vertices.class\r\n==>class java.util.ArrayList\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would think that this would work on 3.3.x without any changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/481641161/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/481643815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1094#issuecomment-481643815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1094","id":481643815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTY0MzgxNQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T11:00:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T11:00:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I assume that the additional information you are adding in the custom serializer is something where you do more traversing on returned objects or gather data from other sources?
