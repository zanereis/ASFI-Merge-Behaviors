High-frequency SQL may or may not an issue. How to statistic all SQLs? Some SQLs are very long, we saw 7k length. So, if you want to discuss this deeply, you need to know what is the ID of a SQL. Because statistic is targeting for the entity which requires an ID.\r\n2. Ignoring `[No statement]` is quite simple. Isn't it? Change the `MultiScopesAnalysisListener` to exclude this case, and provide a configuration.(Ignore could be default, I think).\r\n3. All things you want to resolve are irrelative with this query. That is why in the open source collaboration, you should discuss first.

The `PluginInstaller.require()` function is specifically set to run in the context of the top-level module. I did this because I had a test case (don't remember details exactly) where the skywalking plugin could not \"see\" a module the main app was using through its `require()` function and its dir search tree, which led to the module not being instrumented since skywalking could not `require()` it from where it was. So I added this function so that skywalking can `require()` in the same exact way the main module does and sees everything that it does.\r\n\r\n[EDIT}: There is also the possibility when using skywalking via. `npm link` that it may have its own different version / instance of a module compared to the main executing application (which again would wind up not instrumenting the modules the main app is using). Basically anything that is going to be instrumented, and even some stuff that may not be (like probably on-finish), should be required from the point of view of the top-level module to make sure it is the same as the top-level module uses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/752722626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/752747987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6109#issuecomment-752747987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6109","id":752747987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1Mjc0Nzk4Nw==","user":{"login":"tom-pytel","id":51921719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTIxNzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51921719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel","html_url":"https://github.com/tom-pytel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tom-pytel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-30T20:26:58Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T21:57:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am preemptively sending you my test suite since I will probably be asleep by the time you see all of this.
