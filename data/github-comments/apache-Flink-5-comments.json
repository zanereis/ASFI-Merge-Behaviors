Otherwise, the data is shuffled again.\nI'm pretty sure this behavior is never wanted and think it opens a potential trap. Also multiple successors with different DOPs might cause problems.\nThese were exactly the cases, I tried to avoid with my implementation (+ repartitioning where it does not make any sense).\n\nThe way it is done in this PR, makes things more explicit and controlable for the user. A user can do more stuff but also a lot of very stupid things.\nI would prefer the safer alternative, but won't veto if others find this is a better solution.\n\nHowever, if we go with the PR, I vote to make the risk of this operator mcuh more clear in the JavaDocs and the documentation.\nWe could also include the DOP as an additional parameter to rebalance() and partitionByHash() and deactivate the setParallelism() to make clear that the DOP is very important for this operator (-1 could be used for the default parallelsim).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/56951810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/56957293","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/128#issuecomment-56957293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/128","id":56957293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTU3Mjkz","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-26T12:54:12Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T12:54:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this variant is a lot simpler and keeps the API clean. Calling partitioning is something that a user should use, when he wants explicit control, and I think it is okay if that leads to situations where the partitioning turns out redundant (we could also fix this later with optimizer rules, but we cannot fix the API once public).\n\nWhen calling explicit partitioning before a join, the optimizer will reuse the partitioning. When calling it before reduce, only the combiner will be dropped.\n\nRegarding parallelism: Calling rebalancing when the DOP changes is redundant, because the DOP change will cause a rebalance by itself, but it does not hurt. Calling partition() and then change the DOP voids the partitioning, that is true. I would accept that for now and rather throw an error now (e.g. in the optimizer \"partition operator followed by DOP change\", and later fix it with an optimizer rule or so) \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/56957293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/56957333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/128#issuecomment-56957333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/128","id":56957333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTU3MzMz","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-26T12:54:32Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T12:54:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The reasoning is that internals are so much easier to change than APIs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/56957333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/56962756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/128#issuecomment-56962756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/128","id":56962756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTYyNzU2","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-26T13:43:26Z","updated_at":"2014-09-26T13:43:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well, the API is pretty much the same in both variants.
