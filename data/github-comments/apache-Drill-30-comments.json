Where you using the `start` command? There is exactly one place where the error \"Failed to start Drill application master\" is thrown: it is when Drill-on-YARN fails to start the application master. There are lots of other messages for other issues such as \"Error: AM already running as Application ID: 1234\" or \"Failed to allocate Drill application master.\"\r\n\r\nWhen writing the client, I made an explicit decision not to create a log file to avoid cluttering up things. There is no good place to put a client log since Drill does not actually run on the client machine. We could add a log, but it would be messy.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do, however, is include the text of the message we got from YARN when we tried to start the AM process. When an error occurs, the client will now print something line the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to start Drill application master.\r\n  Caused by: Some YARN error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other thing we can add is a full stack dump, but only when requested with the `-v` (verbose) option:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> drill-on-yarn.sh -v start\r\nFailed to start Drill application master.\r\n  Caused by: Some YARN error\r\nFull stack trace:\r\n(stack trace here)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't easily test this code. Please grab the latest sources and rerun your test case to ensure that it now prints out more information: whatever YARN tells us about why it would not start the AM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370206878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370207752","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1011#issuecomment-370207752","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1011","id":370207752,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDIwNzc1Mg==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-04T07:20:53Z","updated_at":"2018-03-04T07:20:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased onto latest master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370207752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370208897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1011#issuecomment-370208897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1011","id":370208897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDIwODg5Nw==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-04T07:46:38Z","updated_at":"2018-03-04T07:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, turned out that there were unneeded dependencies in the DoY additions to the drill-root pom.xml file.

Even when we are using AtomicReferences and volatile the following sequence of events could happen which could cause a memory leak:\r\n\r\n  1. Let's say there are two Threads. The **Close thread** which starts at the beginning of the close method, and the **Next thread** which starts at the beginning of the innerNext method.\r\n  1. Now let's say the **Next Thread** runs and checks **ok**. Since close has not been called yet **ok** is true.\r\n  1. Now the **Next Thread** is after the ok check.\r\n  1. The **Close thread** now starts executing. And the close thread clears the partitioner.\r\n  1. Now after the partitioner is cleared the **Next Thread** can resume executing. If the **Next thread** receives an OK_SCHEMA he will allocate a new partitioner. Since the OK_SCHEMA message may include records the partitioner may partition some data as well.\r\n  1. Now the **Close thread** is done, but there is a partitioner that has not been closed, and we will leak memory.\r\n\r\nIn order to properly solve this problem we need to make sure that the innerNext and close methods are mutually exclusive so the above scenario can never happen. The easiest way to do that is to use the synchronized key word. If we use the synchronized keyword then we don't have to use volatile or atomic reference.\r\n\r\nAlso as a side note using synchronized will probably be more efficient since a cache flush would only be triggered at the start of the innerNext and close method. Alternatively if we used volatile and AtomicReference a cache flush would be triggered every time we accessed the ok and partitioner variables.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370551110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370564522","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1105#issuecomment-370564522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1105","id":370564522,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDU2NDUyMg==","user":{"login":"ilooner","id":8020165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjAxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8020165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner","html_url":"https://github.com/ilooner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilooner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-05T21:02:57Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T21:02:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva Applied review comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370564522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370648538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1150#issuecomment-370648538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1150","id":370648538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDY0ODUzOA==","user":{"login":"ppadma","id":1904860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma","html_url":"https://github.com/ppadma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppadma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T03:18:06Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T03:18:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is very useful for testing complex types.

However, I still believe innerNext and receivingFragmentFinished could be called concurrently, since the ControlMessageHandler thread executes recievingFragmentFinished. Additionally in rare cases where a limit query is cancelled recievingFragmentFinished and close could be called concurrently as well. While reflecting on your comments I also saw another issue where the root could be blocked on a next call but a Finished event would not cause root to terminate.\r\n\r\nIn light of all of this I actually think the **synchronized** is not sufficient. We will have to have some way to interrupt the execution of the root when we received a finish signal and only close out the resources after receivingFragmentFinished has been called. Similarly if we receive a finish signal we should ignore any cancellation requests instead of trying to cancel and finish simultaneously and vice versa.\r\n\r\nI will rework the solution to address these issues and let you know when I have an update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370938079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/370951693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1138#issuecomment-370951693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1138","id":370951693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDk1MTY5Mw==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T22:26:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T22:26:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vvysotskyi, thanks for addressing the schema issues!

One of such commits was `[CALCITE-1150] Add dynamic record type and dynamic star for schema-on-read table`. In our older Calcite fork `DYNAMIC_STAR` was `*`, but after rebase onto Calcite 1.15, it became `**`.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, `DYNAMIC_STAR` itself means \"default column\" which will be added to table row type for the case when we have `select *` query and the schema of the underlying table is not known. \r\n\r\nAs for the name of constant, I think current `DYNAMIC_STAR` more suitable, since Calcite also uses a similar name for the same string: `DynamicRecordType.DYNAMIC_STAR_PREFIX`.

This change now removes all synchronization from PartitionSenderRootExec and enforces the guarantee that all the lifecycle methods of the PartitionSenderRootExec will only be called by a single Run thread in the FragmentExecutor. Also while making this change I discovered a few other bugs with how cancellations and receiver finishes are handled, so I have addressed those bugs as well. I will go into more detail about what I changed below.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nAs Vlad pointed out **close** and **innerNext** are never called concurrently. After closer inspection of the code I also released that currently (in apache master) innerNext and close will always be called by the **FragmentExecutor#run** thread. The only method of PartitionSenderRootExec that is not called by the **FragmentExecutor#run** thread is **receivingFragmentFinished**. In order to simplify the implementation of PartitionSenderRootExec and also simplify the design of the FragmentExecutor I changed the code so that only the **FragmentExecutor#run** thread calls **receivingFragmentFinished** as well. In this way we can remove all the synchronization from PartitionSenderRootExec. This was done by by:\r\n 1. Making the event processor save the FragmentHandle in the event that a receiver finish request was sent. \r\n 2. After the **root.next()** loop terminates in **FragmentExecutor#run** the eventProcessor is checked to see if a finish request was received. If so **receivingFragmentFinished** is called on root by the **FragmentExecutor#run** method.\r\n\r\n# Other Bugs\r\n\r\n## Processing of multiple termination requests\r\n\r\nThe event processor would process all cancellation and finish requests, even if there is more than one. This doesn't really make sense, since we can only cancel or finish once. So I have changed the event processor to execute only the first termination request and ignore all the others.\r\n\r\n## Simultaneous Cancellation and Finishing\r\n\r\nSince the event processor would process multiple termination requests concurrently it was possible for a cancel and a finish message to be received and processed simultaneously. The results of this were not well defined since **close** and **receivingFragmentFinished** could be called concurrently.\r\n\r\n# Other Improvements\r\n\r\nVlad also pointed out that we did not need the hasCloseoutThread atomic reference, since we were already using the myThreadRef atomic reference.

from `avatica.metrics` are used in `JsonHandler`, `ProtobufHandler` and `LocalService`. `org.apache.http` classes are used in `AvaticaCommonsHttpClientImpl` and in `AvaticaCommonsHttpClientSpnegoImpl`. If Drill does not use these classes or classes which use these classes than I agree that we can exclude it from `jdbc-all` jar. \r\nRegarding excluding `avatica/org/apache/commons`, looks like Avatica pom files have a small problem since there are no dependencies to `org.apache.commons`, but it was shaded to the jar.
