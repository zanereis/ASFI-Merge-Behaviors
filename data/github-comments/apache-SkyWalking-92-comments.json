WuSheng, I had Solved the problem of \"java.security.PrivilegedAction\". I set the agent's owner to the owner of WebSphere. And add \"grant codeBase \"file:${agent_dir}/-\" { permission java.security.AllPermission; };\" in the file of \"server.policy\". Now skywalking agent can run in WebSphere 6.1 ,7.0, 8.0 with openjdk 1.6.0 , and Apps run normally.\r\nBut there is still a problem that my websphere plugin cannot work. My agent has many plugins , such as websphere plugin and oracle plugin.

The document said: `In general, when you don’t set a deadline, resources will be held for all in-flight requests, and all requests can potentially reach the maximum timeout. This puts the service at risk of running out of resources, like memory, which would increase the latency of the service, or could crash the entire process in the worst case.` I think the 10s deadline is too large because the agent sends the segments to the server-side every 30s. No more time for the next round.
