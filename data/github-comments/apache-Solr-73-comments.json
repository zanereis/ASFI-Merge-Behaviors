I guess a `hostContext` that contains only `/` may be valid from the user's perspective, but we cannot handle it without additional workarounds and the current logic.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to use a URL builder which we can feed the path segments with and without leading and trailing slashes and it will take care of everything. Otherwise we would have to add just another workaround, like\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (hostContext.equals(\"/\")) {\r\n  hostContext = \"\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nright after the current workaround `if (hostContext.isBlank()) {...}`. Maybe it's time to reconsider the normalization logic?Concatenating URL paths should definitely not be done by simply appending the paths, as we cannot guarantee the presence / absence of slashes.\r\n\r\n_Using URL builders_\r\nI looked into the implementation of `org.apache.http.client.utils.URIBuilder` and `jakarta.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder` (both present right now) and only the jakarta implementation can take leading and trailing slashes into account, if used properly. This means that code like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nsolrUpdateUrl = UriBuilder.fromUri(SolrCLI.normalizeSolrUrl(solrUrl, true, hostContext))\r\n    .path(hostContext)\r\n    .path(cli.getOptionValue(\"name\")) // \"testBasicRun\"\r\n    .path(\"/update\")\r\n    .path(\"/with/\")\r\n    .path(\"slashes/\")\r\n    .path(\"/again\")\r\n    .build();\r\n// generates http://127.0.0.1:52371/solr/testBasicRun/update/with/slashes/again\r\n\r\n```\r\nwould correctly generate the path. Maybe we could use a more robust solution like that?\r\n\r\nNote that using `UriBuilder#segment` which looks like a more suitable function would escape the slashes:\r\n ```java\r\nsolrUpdateUrl = UriBuilder.fromUri(SolrCLI.normalizeSolrUrl(solrUrl, true, hostContext) + hostContext)\r\n    .segment(cli.getOptionValue(\"name\"), \"/update\", \"/with/\", \"slashes/\", \"/again\")\r\n    .build();\r\n// generates http://127.0.0.1:52215/solr/testBasicRun/%2Fupdate/%2Fwith%2F/slashes%2F/%2Fagain\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2426569848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2427166378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2778#issuecomment-2427166378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2778","id":2427166378,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6Qq56q","user":{"login":"epugh","id":22395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh","html_url":"https://github.com/epugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-21T16:32:29Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T16:32:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Of the two URI builders, I think we would want the jakarta since at some point Apache HTTP Client goes away.   \r\n\r\nWhat about just looking for `//` and removing one of them?

Different APIs use different error for \"does not exist\" responses: /api/collections/collectionName returns a 400, /api/aliases/specificalias returns a 405, /solr/collectionName/schema/fields/fieldName returns a 404\r\n\r\nI'm personally a fan of 404 in this case as it seems a little more actionable for users than the more generic '400', so that'd be my preference.  But I don't have any strong feelings on that point, and would be open to something else if you do have preferences?  When we decide, we should document the decision in `dev-docs/v2-api-conventions.adoc` so there's a \"standard\" we can align on.\r\n\r\n(I suspect the 405 returned by `GET /api/aliases/nonexistentAlias` is a bug, FWIW.

IMO it cuts down on boilerplate, and makes reviewing and browsing easier by keeping a bunch of related definitions together.  But again, it's a very slight preference on my end if you happen to prefer the alternative.\r\n\r\n> The new v2 JAX-RS Bulk Update ClusterProp API requires providing a body that looks like {\"properties\":{\"actualPropertyToBeUpdated\":...}} because I didn't know how to map an unknown top-level value\r\n\r\nHmm - I think you should be able to nuke `SetNestedClusterPropertyRequestBody` altogether, and replace it in the method signature with `Map<String, Object>`? e.g.\r\n    \r\n```\r\n  @PUT\r\n  @Operation(\r\n      summary = \"Set nested cluster properties in this Solr cluster\",\r\n      tags = {\"cluster-properties\"})\r\n  SolrJerseyResponse createOrUpdateNestedClusterProperty(\r\n      @RequestBody(description = \"Property/ies to be set\", required = true)\r\n          Map<String, Object> propertyValuesByName)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr does that break something or other that I've forgotten about?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2438568772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2439282497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1895#issuecomment-2439282497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1895","id":2439282497,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6RZH9B","user":{"login":"iamsanjay","id":6595915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTU5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6595915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay","html_url":"https://github.com/iamsanjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-26T04:07:21Z","updated_at":"2024-10-26T04:07:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"git bisect points to this PR.

This is yet another argument for having a generic LB Client and not subclasses, but I also feel this is beyond the scope of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2447614530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/2448046838","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2805#issuecomment-2448046838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2805","id":2448046838,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM6R6jr2","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-30T18:34:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-30T18:34:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">  this is beyond the scope of this PR\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I agree; it's *how* the issue is approached.
