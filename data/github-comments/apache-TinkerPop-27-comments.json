As far as I understand the code the traversal given to those functions would anyway split if necessary (e.g. a map step).

So a user will always use the first _version_ of the package with a version as `3.2.5-SNAPSHOT` that was retrieved from nuget.org. He won't get any updates after that until we publish a package with a higher version such as `3.2.5-Z`, because he already has the package with the version `3.2.5-SNAPSHOT` in his cache.\r\nThe solution mentioned in that comment suggests that users don't explicitly specify the version number in their projects. Instead they can specify the version as `3.2.5-*` (instead of `3.2.5-beta01` for example) which means that they always get the latest pre-release version, but that still requires later packages to have a higher version number. (That solution was also specific to the now obsolete `project.json` project format and I am not sure if it still works exactly like that.)\r\nSo we definitely have to increase the version number somehow when we want to publish updates. We basically have the following options for that:\r\n\r\n1. A fixed tag such as `SNAPSHOT` or `beta` plus a number that has to be manually incremented each time we change something (to Gremlin-DotNet or Gremlin-CSharp): `3.2.5-beta01`, `3.2.5-beta02`, ...\r\n2. A fixed tag plus a build tag that is set during the build process (for example by Travis): `3.2.5-beta-build1234`, `3.2.5-beta-build1235`, ...\r\n\r\nxUnit uses a combination of both and also goes through `alpha`, `beta` and `rc`.\r\n\r\nBut since there probably won't be that many changes to Gremlin-CSharp or Gremlin-DotNet my personal preference is that we simply increment a number in the suffix manually each time a change is merged into the C# GLV branch. So we could start for example with `3.2.5-beta01`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/302500811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/302503779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/600#issuecomment-302503779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/600","id":302503779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjUwMzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-18T18:33:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T18:33:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i guess we have precedence for this with python and pypi.
