As @eiri points out, at least in my experience it makes one think more deeply about useful log ... _content_ I'll call it 😄 \r\n\r\nFWIW I have tended to think of the \"message\" as the human readable bit that will show up by default in tools like Kibana or Splunk. In this thinking should therefore be a useful one line to scan. So for the compaction example, I would likely choose to output the message of \"Compaction started for shards/.....\" rather than just \"Compaction started.\". I think this is my only main insight that I haven't seen in the awesome discussion on this ticket so far :) \r\n\r\nWhile I think @eiri is right that message is \"just another field\", most solutions appear to output a `message` field by default in the UI and have disclosure arrows to view other things, so I do think that these messages need to be useful for a human reading the logs.\r\n\r\nFor the other fields, I've tended to think about what would be useful from a searching perspective. So \"action: compaction_start\" might be a useful one that these examples miss out. Broadly: what should I include that means that a search doesn't have to include free-text searches of the message field. In practice this usually means duplicated information between the message and the fields.\r\n\r\nFor the API specifics:\r\n\r\n- I side with @eiri that a single \"bin\" for the extra fields in the JSON is easier, it's not obvious to me whether there's a natural mapping. For the meta-info of line etc. perhaps the macro/parse transform needs to validate no name clashes once its validated the log level? Problem here is that you need good test code coverage to make sure this doesn't explode (could a transform do this check at compile time?).\r\n- I like something like:\r\n          \r\n        couch_log:error(FormatString, FormatArgs, ExtraFields)\r\n\r\n    which ends up like:\r\n\r\n        couch_log:error(\"Compaction started for ~p\", [{shard, \"shards/...\"}], [{user, \"foo\"}, {shard, \"shards/...\"}])\r\n\r\n    Note the duplication of shard info, but I think this makes reading the logs and searching them simpler. Arguably you could have named bit in the string formatting that could read fields from `ExtraFields` to avoid having to have the `FormatArgs` argument. I don't know if Erlang's formatting supports it though.\r\n- I have always liked the \"log4X\" pattern where what to log is separate from the format of the log, and they are configured separately. At a scan, the Erlang 21 logger @kocolosk links to follows this pattern; I've always liked python's `logger` class too, though it's a bit long in the tooth.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/417602224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/417637717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1373#issuecomment-417637717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1373","id":417637717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzYzNzcxNw==","user":{"login":"iilyak","id":9804420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9804420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak","html_url":"https://github.com/iilyak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iilyak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-31T11:36:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T11:36:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you @mikerhodes. \r\n\r\n> So \"action: compaction_start\" might be a useful one that these examples miss out. \r\n\r\nWe definitely missed `action` field.

Can't think of a good way to solve it without defining some naming rules beforehand and then adding a check for compliance as a part of a review process. \r\nThan again I might be overthinking this and it doesn't matter as long as the actions are unique and greppable in code.\r\n\r\nOn another note, here seems to be a general believe that `FormatArgs` always represent data worth adding to a data portion of logs. I personally don't think that's the case, with a message `log(\"Starting compaction for shard ~p on update sequence ~p\", [<<\"shard\">>, 12])` it would be helpful to have an ability to query by `shard` field, much less so for `update_sequence` field. Let's not forget that data points are not free, each represent an index on a receiving side meaning storage size and log processing rate.\r\n\r\nIf we are insist on treating `FormatArgs` and `ExtraFields` as the same, then probably we are better to give up on `io_lib:format` for message formatting and switch to a proper templating like [mustache](https://github.com/mojombo/mustache.erl) or [dtl](https://github.com/erlydtl/erlydtl), if we can't keep things simple we as well can go whole way.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/418370850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/418497012","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1594#issuecomment-418497012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1594","id":418497012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODQ5NzAxMg==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T19:54:44Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T19:54:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @ahayes, thanks for this report.\r\n\r\nYou've made changes to a packaged config file. We very rarely, but occasionally, make changes to `local.ini` to change the commented-out defaults to their new values, or to add new values to it. This did happen with 2.2.0.\r\n\r\nThe Debian/Ubuntu warnings on the conffile are part of us adhering to Debian policy which [dictates ](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html#s-config-files) that package upgrades MUST take care of preserving user changes to configuration files. We can't simultaneously do that while updating the contents of that file with new guidance or recommendations.\r\n\r\nYou have two options available to you the way things are today:\r\n\r\n1. Pass the appropriate option to `dpkg` from `apt` when doing an upgrade, as [documented here](https://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/09/21/debian-conffile-configuration-file-managed-by-dpkg/). In your case, I expect you'd prefer to have our new version installed as `local.ini.dpkg-dist`. This can be done with:\r\n```bash\r\n$ apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::\"-force-confdef\" -o Dpkg::Options::\"--force-confold\" install --only-upgrade couchdb\r\n```\r\n  * The first option tells dpkg to decide on its own whenever possible, prompting only when necessary, and overwriting any config files that have not been modified.\r\n  * The second option says to not modify the current configuration file if changed, and install the new version from tha package with the `.dpkg-dist` suffix.\r\n  * I've shown `install --only-upgrade couchdb` to limit this process to just the `couchdb` package. If you'd used `dist-upgrade` there, `apt-get` would proceed to apply the same approach across all packages, not just `couchdb`. You can use this if you want.\r\n2. Another workaround is for you to simply not modify `local.ini`, and instead place new files inside of the `local.d` directory named with a `.ini` extension. These files are processed after all other files, including `local.ini`, [per the order described in the documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/intro.html#configuration-files). In this case, there will never be a change to `local.ini` that will conflict with your changes.\r\n\r\nI agree with your assessment that we should improve this going forward. Ideally, we wouldn't have `default.ini` or `local.ini` files at all, and would just use the contents of the `local.d` directory as provided by you, the end user. This would be part of a larger config subsystem rewrite that would address concerns like #777. I will open a new ticket on the roadmap for this (it's been under discussion for a while, but no roadmap ticket exists yet) and link back to this one so you can follow its progress in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your interest in Apache CouchDB!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/418497012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/418500681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1594#issuecomment-418500681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1594","id":418500681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODUwMDY4MQ==","user":{"login":"ahayes","id":1750076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTAwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1750076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes","html_url":"https://github.com/ahayes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahayes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T20:07:16Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T20:07:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for the detailed response with options for me and for linking back so I can stay in the loop!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/418500681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/418505776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1595#issuecomment-418505776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1595","id":418505776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODUwNTc3Ng==","user":{"login":"chewbranca","id":5326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca","html_url":"https://github.com/chewbranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chewbranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T20:24:46Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T20:24:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Related to `2.` on the topic of default config values, if we're going to spend the time reworking config, I would really like to see sane defaults for _all_ config lookups directly in the code, even potentially getting rid of the `config:get/2` lookup which drops in the default `undefined` value.

Hopefully we are not starting the same process in many places 😄 \r\n\r\n> I personally don't think that's the case, with a message log(\"Starting compaction for shard ~p on update sequence ~p\", [<<\"shard\">>, 12]) it would be helpful to have an ability to query by shard field, much less so for update_sequence field.\r\n\r\nThat's a really good point. Looking at other things I've used in the past, they do split up the idea of the format args for the message from the extra structured fields args. \r\n\r\nI think @iilyak's proposal takes that into account:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncouch_log:error(\"Compaction started for ~p\", [shard], #{\r\n     user => \"foo\", \r\n     shard => \"shards/...\"\r\n}).\r\n```\r\n\r\nI, at least, found this a very readable code stanza.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/420247812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/420745387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1593#issuecomment-420745387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1593","id":420745387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc0NTM4Nw==","user":{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:10:46Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T18:10:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1

If my data looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  _id: \"someid\",\r\n  date: \"2018-08-24\",\r\n  status: \"provisional\",\r\n  invoiceAddress: {\r\n    street: \"10 Front Street\",\r\n    city: \"Dallas\",\r\n    state: \"Texas\"\r\n  },\r\n  amount: 7.99,\r\n  tax: 0,\r\n  totalAmount: 7.99,\r\n  customerId: \"A65522\",\r\n  lineItems: [\r\n    {\r\n      productId: \"P1\",\r\n      name: \"fish\",\r\n      cost: 6.0\r\n    },\r\n     {\r\n      productId: \"P2\",\r\n      name: \"chips\",\r\n      cost: 1.99\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```  \r\n\r\nand I want only the \"complete\" orders from a database I could perform a query.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n     status : \"complete\"\r\n  },\r\n  fields: [\"totalAmount\", \"date\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would give a paged result set in blocks of 200 records:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n\t\"docs\": [\r\n\t  {\r\n\t    \"totalAmount\": 7.99,\r\n\t    \"date\": \"2018-08-24\"\r\n          },\r\n\t  {\r\n\t    \"totalAmount\": 4.50,\r\n\t    \"date\": \"2018-08-24\"\r\n          },\r\n\t  ...\r\n\t],\r\n\t\"bookmark\": \"g1AAAAA6eJzLYWBgYMpgSmHgKy5JLCrJTq2MT8lPzkzJBYqzVqUmFSWCJDlgkgjhLADXERDn\",\r\n\t\"execution_stats\": {\r\n\t\t\"total_keys_examined\": 0,\r\n\t\t\"total_docs_examined\": 10,\r\n\t\t\"total_quorum_docs_examined\": 0,\r\n\t\t\"results_returned\": 8,\r\n\t\t\"execution_time_ms\": 2.75\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"warning\": \"no matching index found, create an index to optimize query time\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut what I really want is a grand total of the `totalAmount` fields, grouped by `date` but Mango only supports *selection* not *aggregation*. I would have to page through all the results and perform the aggregation in my code.\r\n\r\nThis document imagines that Mango magically *does* support aggregation. Everything that follows is fictional syntax in my imaginary world.\r\n\r\n--- start of imaginary world ---\r\n\r\n## My first Mango aggregation\r\n\r\nI can use the new \"aggregator\" object in a Mango query. My query still has a selector, because I don't want to aggregate ALL the documents, only the \"complete\" orders as before:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    status : \"complete\"\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n- I no longer need to supply a `fields` object at the top level. Mango knows the fields it needs from those specified in the aggregator object.\r\n- the `aggregator.operation` field can be one of `sum`, `count` or `stats`.\r\n- `aggregator.of` is an array - we'll see how this works later.\r\n\r\nIf I'm using the `count` aggregation, I needn't supplied an `aggregation.of` array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    status : \"complete\"\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"count\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## A grand total example\r\n\r\nUsing an `aggreator.operation` of `sum` allows me to get a grand total of a field:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    status : \"complete\"\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor fields:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    status : \"complete\"\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\", \"tax\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor by emptying the \"selector\", all documents are aggregated:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: { },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\", \"tax\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Grouping\r\n\r\nIn this example I am performing a more complex selector and introduce grouping:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    \"$or\": {\r\n      status : \"complete\",\r\n      status: \"refunded\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\", \"tax\"],\r\n    group: [\"date\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny valid Mango selector is allowed in the \"selector\" object. The \"selector\" is evaluated at index time and decides which portion of the data makes it to the index. If the selector is changed, a new index is required to calculate the result.\r\n\r\nThe optional \"aggregator.group\" is an array of keys by which the sum is grouped in the result set. It is an array, so I can have multi-dimensional grouping:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    \"$or\": {\r\n      status : \"complete\",\r\n      status: \"refunded\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\", \"tax\"],\r\n    group: [\"date\", \"invoiceAddress.state\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above example groups by \"invoiceAddress.state\" which demonstrates selecting data from a sub-object.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How this works\r\n\r\nCouchDB cannot perform aggregations without an index, but instead of insisting that the user perform an additional \"index\" step, CouchDB will create the appropriate index (if it doesn't already exist) and return the results once indexing is complete.\r\n\r\n** this is a big leap - but, hey, this is an imaginary world **\r\n\r\ne.g. for an aggregation query like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    status : \"complete\"\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\"],\r\n    group: [\"date\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe need an index that looks like this in old-school JavaScript MapReduce\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmap: \r\n\tfunction(doc) {\r\n\t  if (doc.status === 'complete') {\r\n\t    emit([doc.date], [doc.amount])\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\nreduce:\r\n   \"_sum\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"selector\" in an aggregation is really a `partial_filter_selector` so that the index only contains a sub-set of the documents.\r\n\r\n## Limit the result set with range\r\n\r\nThe trouble with this approach is that the aggregation query always returns all of the aggregations e.g. if one sum per day for every day that you have data. You may only want this month's per-day aggregates. This is where `aggregator.range` comes in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  selector: {\r\n    \"$or\": {\r\n      status : \"complete\",\r\n      status: \"refunded\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  aggregator: {\r\n    operation: \"sum\",\r\n    of: [\"totalAmount\", \"tax\"],\r\n    group: [\"date\", \"invoiceAddress.state\"],\r\n    range: {\r\n      start: [\"2018-08-01\"],\r\n      end: [\"2018-09-01\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `aggregator.range` object can be used at query time to return a smaller proportion of the aggregated result, whether grouping or not.\r\n\r\n---- end of imaginary world ---","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/422799520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/422843552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/1551#issuecomment-422843552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1551","id":422843552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjg0MzU1Mg==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-19T15:18:06Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T15:18:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"2.3.0 is being planned for release now.

A lot of local documents could increase the file size like that.\r\n\r\nDo you know which type you have more of _local/<id> or _local/shard-sync-<id>?\r\n\r\nIf it is the first kind (_local/<id>), then those are the result of using the database as a replication endpoint.  CouchDB writes _local checkpoint documents on the source and target, so next time it restarts the replication between source and target it will resume from changes feed from the checkpointed value and not from the very beginning. \r\n\r\nHowever that means that each {source, target} pair (along with a few other thing like if there a filter) generates a _local document. If say source is used for a public demo, then there could be a very large number of {source, target} pairs generated and thus a large number of _local/<id> documents present. \r\n\r\nThere is an option to avoid this http://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/replicator.html#replicator/use_checkpoints and it could help in these cases. Read additional info and the warning regarding using that option, but it sounds like it might help your case.\r\n\r\nIf you see more of the second kind (_local/shard-sync-<id>), then it is hard to say without more debugging why that's happening.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/424007800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
