My testing was on master, commit 20f148b35ed18fa543cbedbc8ad977de54990b7a from 2 Apr.\n\nWhen you say flag, do you mean \"sqlite-persistent\"  on https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-anormdb/src/main/scala/com/twitter/zipkin/util/DBConfig.scala#L54 and https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/blob/master/project/Project.scala#L272?  If so, I don't see how to change backends without changing those values and recompiling.\n\nAt the very least, I'd like to try to get unit tests for sqlite (memory and persistent) and h2 (memory and persistent) against the SQL changes I made.
