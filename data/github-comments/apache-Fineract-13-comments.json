If you do do like this, and are in favour of this approach, then you can \"LGTM\" this PR, and perhaps would be willing to close your #723 ?  \r\n\r\nIf you are further interested in the general topic of security and SQL injections, you would be very very welcome to continue working in this area! Some ideas: 1. Implement the `TODO` about the `toString()` in `SQLBuilder`[`Test`] (which I didn't have time for); 2. similarly change `CenterReadPlatformServiceImpl`'s and `GroupReadPlatformServiceImpl`'s remaining use of `ApiParameterHelper.sqlEncodeString` to this approach (and then delete `sqlEncodeString`), and then more work as described in [FINERACT-854](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-854)...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/596230270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/596231236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/677#issuecomment-596231236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/677","id":596231236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjIzMTIzNg==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T17:41:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T17:41:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"==> #719","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/596231236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/596231452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/725#issuecomment-596231452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/725","id":596231452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjIzMTQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T17:44:18Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T17:45:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I am very satisfied with this approach(I would have tested it and update).\r\nI am willing to work on the files and issue you mentioned 😄\r\nThanks -

@vorburger I have replaced System.out with LOG statements, but Spotbug is bothered with log performance and suggesting some changes, \r\n\r\nYeah, that's due to the JUST introduced #716, see

locally and noticed there are 270 violations... too many to manually fix up? :smile: Do a bunch every day, instead of all together?\r\n\r\nAlternatives I can think of could be to configure Checkstyle to not run this particular check on src/test and only src/main, but I think that will be a PITA to configure (you would need separate configuration files, and somehow tell the Gradle plugin to run different configs for different dirs; I'm not sure that's possible), and also confusing for future developers, so I wouldn't do that and keep it simple.\r\n\r\nIn terms of best use of time, what I would probably do if I were you is maybe pause this one, and first move on to gradually activating other Checkstyle checks, and then come back to this one later / at the end.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/599232398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/599233186","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/733#issuecomment-599233186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/733","id":599233186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5OTIzMzE4Ng==","user":{"login":"thesmallstar","id":42006277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDA2Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42006277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar","html_url":"https://github.com/thesmallstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesmallstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-15T16:31:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-15T16:31:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vorburger
