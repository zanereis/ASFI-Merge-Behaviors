We are also working on the metrics for the agent side recently, for example the metrics of Kafka producer and consumer.\r\n\r\nMy question is whether it is possible to use micrometer in the plugin thru [`MeterBinder`](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/micrometer-core/src/main/java/io/micrometer/core/instrument/binder/MeterBinder.java). Then everything would be extremely easy in the sense that there are a lot of micrometer implementations now.\r\n\r\nI suppose so far the micrometer plugin is only available for the application.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/696472352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/696472898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5494#issuecomment-696472898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/5494","id":696472898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjQ3Mjg5OA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T02:07:41Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T02:07:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"MicroMeter has been supported for a while.

Mobile adaptIon\r\n\r\n**Blog**\r\n\r\n1. Modify the display elements of the list to add information such as author and tag.\r\n1. Set the scheme information for the blog(this will be used on every blog post markdown header config)\r\n\r\n**Events**\r\n\r\n1. Adjust the page layout of a single evnet and fix display errors in the sidebar.\r\n\r\n**Team & Downloads**\r\n\r\n1.
