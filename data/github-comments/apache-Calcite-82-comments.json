I think we're good.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of changes don't require review - there was only one choice to make. In one or two places I had to make a decision; e.g. in MongoEnumerator I added the 3 `if` ... `throw` lines, because the alternative,  to change the return to `@Nullable Object`, was inferior:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Override public Object current() {\r\n    if (current == null) {\r\n      throw new IllegalStateException();\r\n    }\r\n    return current;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n> This may cause lots of conflicts if people have work under way.\r\n\r\nAgreed.

The additional clarity from introducing an explicit immutable version of ScopeMap is marginal, while the complexity introduced is significant. This is due to your desire for a redelegation layer in SqlValidator, the existing circular dependencies between ScopeMap, namespaces, and SqlValidator, and the non-trivial methods in ScopeMapImpl, which need to support downstream overriding while not have code duplication.  In addition, the scopeMap reference would have to mutate within SqlValidatorImpl, which would create a complex lifecycle and essentially negate the intended clarity. \r\n\r\nAllowing downstream projects to override ScopeMapImpl is why it's currently package-scoped. Moreover, several methods in ScopeMap and ScopeMapImpl are public or protected, so we'd need to provide an API for overriding those methods moving forward, unless we plan to offer an upgrade path for projects that have customized them.\r\n\r\nGiven the complexity of these interactions and the time it would take to implement, I’m not willing to introduce an immutable version of ScopeMap at this time. However, the work on the ScopeMap interface will make it easier to add an immutable version later, once the circular dependencies are resolved.\r\n\r\nI can add a redegalation layer to SqlValidator, but please be very explicit on why you want this, because I do not understand.  All it seems to do is adding 200 lines of boilerplate while making api opaque and creating future work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2357145268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2357265908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3965#issuecomment-2357265908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3965","id":2357265908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM6MgQX0","user":{"login":"sonarqubecloud[bot]","id":39514782,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk1MTQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonarqubecloud%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-18T00:44:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-18T00:44:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

After this fix, SCALAR_QUERY is present in sourceExpressionList of original `SqlUpdate` AST node. The `SqlToRelConverter` test uses the deprecated `withExpand(false)` config setting, and as a result, SCALAR_QUERY is replaced to a constant. And that's ok, but when using `withExpand(true)` this SCALAR_QUERY will not be replaced with a constant even at planning phase (may be the problem in `SubQueryRemoveRule` or somewhere else).

After this fix, SCALAR_QUERY is present in sourceExpressionList of original `SqlUpdate` AST node. The `SqlToRelConverter` test uses the deprecated `withExpand(false)` config setting, and as a result, SCALAR_QUERY is replaced to a constant. And that's ok, but when using `withExpand(true)` this SCALAR_QUERY will not be replaced with a constant even at planning phase (may be the problem in `SubQueryRemoveRule` or somewhere else). As a result, we can observe in the \"physical\" plan the original SCALAR_SUBQUERY (with LOGICAL nodes) in the `sourceExpressionList` of `TableModify` 🤔\r\n> > If the patch needs to be improved, then feel free to remove it from the current scope (1.38.0), so that it doesn't delay the release.\r\n> \r\n> @xtern Hi. You mean that it can only be recognized as a constant in the physical stage? It feels strange.\r\n\r\nIn my previous message I mixed up the `withExpand` flag values .I fixed the message. \r\nBy default the `isExpand() = false`, but in `SqlToRelConverterTest uses` `isExpand() = true`\r\n\r\nLet's turn it off and see the difference in plan tree in existing test `testUpdateSubQuery` (it's not new test) \r\n\r\nWithout this fix the plan is:\r\n```\r\nLogicalTableModify(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]], operation=[UPDATE], updateColumnList=[[EMPNO]], sourceExpressionList=[[$0]], flattened=[true])\r\n  LogicalProject(EMPNO=[$0], ENAME=[$1], JOB=[$2], MGR=[$3], HIREDATE=[$4], SAL=[$5], COMM=[$6], DEPTNO=[$7], SLACKER=[$8], EXPR$0=[$SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MIN($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject(EMPNO=[$0])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[=($7, $cor1.DEPTNO)])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]])\r\n})])\r\n    LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `sourceExpressionList=[[$0]]`, and SCALAR_QUERY resides only in additional logical project.\r\n\r\nBut after applying this patch the plan is: \r\n```\r\nLogicalTableModify(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]], operation=[UPDATE], updateColumnList=[[EMPNO]], sourceExpressionList=[[$SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MIN($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject(EMPNO=[$0])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[=($7, $cor1.DEPTNO)])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]])\r\n})]], flattened=[true])\r\n  LogicalProject(EMPNO=[$0], ENAME=[$1], JOB=[$2], MGR=[$3], HIREDATE=[$4], SAL=[$5], COMM=[$6], DEPTNO=[$7], SLACKER=[$8], EXPR$0=[$SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MIN($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject(EMPNO=[$0])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[=($7, $cor0.DEPTNO)])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]])\r\n})])\r\n    LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]])\r\n```\r\nNote that  \r\n```\r\nsourceExpressionList=[[$SCALAR_QUERY({\r\nLogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[MIN($0)])\r\n  LogicalProject(EMPNO=[$0])\r\n    LogicalFilter(condition=[=($7, $cor1.DEPTNO)])\r\n      LogicalTableScan(table=[[CATALOG, SALES, EMP]])\r\n})]]\r\n```\r\nand this looks like an issue that needs to be fixed before merging this PR :pensive: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2357982325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/2358217136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3847#issuecomment-2358217136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3847","id":2358217136,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM6Mj4mw","user":{"login":"rubenada","id":19411329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDExMzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19411329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada","html_url":"https://github.com/rubenada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-18T11:29:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-18T11:29:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mihaibudiu do you have further comments here?
