interruption being reported twice</p>\n\n<p>    In some classes, thread interruption was being reported twice - by setting the thread interrupted flag and re-throwing the `InterruptedException` - this made it look like the thread was actually interrupted twice, and generally causes spurious interruption - even if the `InterruptedException` is handled, the thread interruption status is still set, meaning the next async operation that happens will also fail.</p>\n\n<p>    Affected classes:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>`ConnectionState` - `closeAndClear` can never throw `InterruptedException` canyway, so remove the check completely</li>\n\t<li>`PersistentNode` - as mentioned in the docs for `AutoCloseable`, close methods shouldn't throw InterruptedException anyway. The delete operation is guaranteed, so even if `deleteNode` throws an exception, the node will still (probably) be deleted</li>\n\t<li>`CreateBuilderImpl`/`DeleteBuilderImpl` - the exception is being re-thrown, so don't need to re-set the interrupt status</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:</p>\n\n<p>    $ git pull <a href=\"https://github.com/thecoop/curator\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/thecoop/curator</a> <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-375\" title=\"Fix thread interruption being reported twice\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-375\">CURATOR-375</a></p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/186.patch\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/186.patch</a></p>\n\n<p>To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch<br/>\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:</p>\n\n<p>    This closes #186</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>commit 81edd7e07a1fae2412c3e42e74a31b992aa72669<br/>\nAuthor: Simon Cooper <simon.cooper@featurespace.co.uk><br/>\nDate:   2017-01-05T14:08:17Z</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CURATOR-375\" title=\"Fix thread interruption being reported twice\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"CURATOR-375\">CURATOR-375</a> - fix thread interruption being reported using thread interrupted flag and an exception at the same time</p>\n\n<hr />","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604752273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604736594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/799#issuecomment-2604736594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/799","id":2604736594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3MzY1OTQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T14:29:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:27:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ozawa\">ozawa</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"randgalt\">Jordan Zimmerman</a> hi Jordan, how is your progress of this issue?
