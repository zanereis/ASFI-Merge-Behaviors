just pushed some fixes:\r\n-  Fixed size estimation (estimation was done based on only one token range on only one node of the cluster). Now size estimation of the table is done  on the whole token ranges on all the nodes. The method is the same that the one in use in cassandra spark connector. I Also introduced a Partitioner class to deal with ranges depending on configured partitioner. Off course, I added the related Tests. \r\n=> But `testRead() `and `testSplitIntoBundles()` now fail because now that size estimation is correct, `splitIntoBundles()` creates n sources, but, as the split query is ignored as I mentioned in above comment, it duplicates dataset by n. Need to \"mix\" the split query and the user query as I mentioned (need a query parser)\r\n\r\n- I also re-architectured the test suite (see details in git
