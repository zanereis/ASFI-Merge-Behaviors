I'm not changing the behaviour of the`hive_to_druid.py` operator. The only thing I'm doing is extracting the [specific config](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/hooks/druid_hook.py#L91-L141) that is related to hive from the operator.\r\n\r\nMy main issue is that the current way of supplying the configuration is not really flexible, for example, it would require a lot of changes, and adding a lot of extra arguments to let the operator work with [Druid Parquet ingestion](http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/extensions-contrib/parquet.html).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to change the current Druid hook, and make it more flexible. Don't change the API of the hive-to-druid operator and add an extra druid operator which is more flexible and not directly interlinked with Hive. This one can be used to ingest from a hdfs directory.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\n\r\nCheers, Fokko","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/309700142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/309714426","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2382#issuecomment-309714426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2382","id":309714426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTcxNDQyNg==","user":{"login":"mention-bot","id":15710697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzEwNjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15710697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/mention-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mention-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-20T10:38:41Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T10:38:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ashb, thanks for your PR!

This change is to enable us to display logs for each task retry/rerun in different tabs instead of one long document. The try_number / attempt is indeed confusing. Basically, it's a monotonically increasing field that keeps track of the number of times a certain task instance gets picked up and executed. Try_number would become 0 once the task gets cleared, but attempt would not change. In the future, it can be used as part of the name of the log file to separate each attempt.
