Does Jetty/Tomcat or other web servers have a built-in implementation? I haven’t gone through the web service code—do the HTTP 1.0 methods (like the GET/POST/DELETE methods exposed by Zeppelin) have the same origin restriction? Do you think we should have a switch for this feature?\r\n\r\nRegarding this, AFAIK, the WebSocket specification does not force SOP. \r\nAlso, the Java API for WebSocket states that the default server configuration for origin check is to fail the handshake if the hostname cannot be verified (I understand this as applying to cases like when there is no origin header).\r\n\r\nThat's why I understood that the `NotebookServer` added its own `checkOrigin()` method in the WebSocket server.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2363766105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2365277034","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4831#issuecomment-2365277034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4831","id":2365277034,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM6M-0Nq","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-21T18:20:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-21T18:20:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks, merged to master for 0.12","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2365277034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/2366259788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4838#issuecomment-2366259788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4838","id":2366259788,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM6NCkJM","user":{"login":"s2moon98","id":55692557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjkyNTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55692557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98","html_url":"https://github.com/s2moon98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s2moon98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-22T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-09-22T09:13:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tbonelee @pan3793 \r\nThank you for mentioning the white space issue. \r\n\r\nI put the eliminating white spaces logic to block the unallowable configurations with white space included such as :\r\n`allow%20LoadLocalInfile=true`\r\n\r\nThe URL with eliminating white spaces is used only when validating, not when creating connection with the URL.

general, this interpreter jar cleanup should already work.\r\nThe special clean goal in the interpreter parent should be triggered by the Flink submodule `flink-scala-2.12` and the Spark submodule `spark-interpreter`\r\nYou can find the cleanup goal here.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/ea0802d24b5fd46a6113481cad3a5f53cecec879/zeppelin-interpreter-parent/pom.xml#L163-L174\r\n\r\nMaybe it doesn't work because of the special submodule structure.

Not to make it too complicated, I would be in favor of your first contribution suggestion. Put the interpreter name in the parent pom.xml of Spark and Flink. Theoretically you could then remove it in the corresponding submodules.\r\nIt is desirable that the complete folder is removed.\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't think it's good that all interpreters store files outside.
