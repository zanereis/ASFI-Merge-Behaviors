For example a scenario might be if you had 3 brokers (A, B, C) and you create consumers on A and B with different predicates but those predicates are now filtered out when creating demand with advisories. That means if a message is published to broker C that could would match the predicate on consumer on A but not B it may still be forwarded to B and now stuck.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how much it matters as I doubt many people are doing this as this issue would have been brought up more often. This fix would probably be ok as long as we update the documentation on the network of brokers page and add something that specifically points out that if that field is set a network of brokers ignores it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/846975779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/846993340","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/647#issuecomment-846993340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/647","id":846993340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0Njk5MzM0MA==","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-24T11:57:28Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T11:57:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jbonofre -

I know you mentioned working on full JMS 2.0 support along w/ big things like replicated-kahadb. I thought I'd pitch in to help get the ball rolling on the low-hanging fruit. There is no real code change here, so I think this PR good to merge and should slide in with your real JMS 2.0 impl work. I also broke up the 2.0 Impl work into sub-tasks here-- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-7309. This should help parallelize the effort amongst contributors.\r\n\r\nReviewing other projects and frameworks, I agree the geronimo vs jakarta is the real question here and I think it makes more sense to go to the Jakarta jar now as it is more target state than using geronimo.\r\n\r\nIf we go geronimo users will have this to look forward to:\r\ngerinomo 1.1 -> geronimo 2.0 -> jakarta 2.0 -> jakarta 3.0\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if we go jakarta now, users have this:\r\ngerinomo 1.1 -> jakarta 2.0 -> jakarta 3.0\r\n\r\nCXF has transitioned many spec jars to jakarta, and I suspect Camel will do the same as well. I think the alignment makes more sense for CXF and Camel to consume the dep ActiveMQ (being as ActiveMQ is the JMS provider as those ride on top of ActiveMQ), or they simply provide the <exclude/>. Either way, the JEE transition is going to force framework devs and users into being savvy with Maven <exclude/> and I do not think there is any way around that.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested in hearing others' perspective as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/881557987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/881566639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/682#issuecomment-881566639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/682","id":881566639,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM840i6Ov","user":{"login":"ehossack-aws","id":77365504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzY1NTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77365504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws","html_url":"https://github.com/ehossack-aws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehossack-aws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-16T16:20:56Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T16:20:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">Either way, the JEE transition is going to force framework devs and users into being savvy with Maven and I do not think there is any way around that.\r\n> \r\n> I'd be interested in hearing others' perspective as well.\r\n\r\n@mattrpav for a usability perspective, whatever approach we take, I think just being helpful on the website is sufficient -> have a page that clearly states what is supported for JMS, what isn't, what would be the required/removed dependencies for maven, gradle and some concise examples","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/881566639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/884327073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/682#issuecomment-884327073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/682","id":884327073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM840tcKh","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-21T16:32:39Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T16:32:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jbonofre @rmannibucau I've updated this round of the PR to include geronimo-jms for the karaf artifacts.
