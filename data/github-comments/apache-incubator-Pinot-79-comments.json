However if a no raw data index is considerably small we can preferably store it in SSDs and separate the data out to object storage. The only caveat here is how to map the index to data locations in object store.  There should be some way to mount the object store locally to pull the corresponding data. Either by defining partitions based on the index which helps to locate the object directly. Also there is a possibility of introducing zstd to further reduce the size and increase the speed of transfer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/743384566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/743425065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6216#issuecomment-743425065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6216","id":743425065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzQyNTA2NQ==","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T21:01:23Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T21:01:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yupeng9 @mayankshriv Cleaned up the PR, added the tests and a JsonIndexQuickStart on the github events data.

My segment config is as follows. The segment timeType is in MINUTES and I am passing five_mins_epoch in MILLISECONDS . Something like 1607472900000 (Wed Dec 09 2020 00:15:00) . So entire 5 minutes the five_mins_epoch is same for all the records.

I understand that this one is mainly for testing purposes so it probably doesn't matter too much. \r\n\r\nIf this is to ever become a production feature for \"quickly uploading some data\" it may be worthwhile to avoid the \"json blob\" as a URL fragment in the upload methods.\r\n\r\nThis could be achieved by either (a) using a JSON payload with the batch configs, as well as a base64-encoded representation of the data, or (b) split out the multipart-upload and launching the ingestion job with \"batch configs\" as two separate invocations.\r\n\r\nBoth have merit:\r\n(a) the JSON one is straight forward and makes this a clean API at the cost of expanding the size of the uploaded data via encoding. If the data is tiny anyways, this would be my suggested approach.\r\n(b) if we want to operate the controller like a small temp file server, then might as well have the ability to upload a multipart file.
