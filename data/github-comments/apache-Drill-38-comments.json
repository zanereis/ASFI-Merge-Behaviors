this is what I meant by the code only working well for a flat vector. Maps have a `MaterializedField` for their own metadata. That metadata contains a list of the child metadata. So:\r\n\r\n```\r\nm:Map, {a:Int, b:Varchar}\r\n. a:INT\r\n. b:Varchar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means, as we add `a`, then, `b` to map `m`, we must mutate the `MaterializedField` for `m` to add the child fields. This completely breaks the idea that a `MaterializedField` is always immutable. This is a place where a design goal (immutable `MateraializedField`) collides with implementation (readers add to maps as they find new fields).\r\n\r\nSo. We could make a clone on each modification and problem solved, right? As in many places in Drill, the solution is not so simple. The above is the easy case. What about a nested map:\r\n\r\n```\r\nm1:Map, {m2:Map {a:Int, b:Varchar}}\r\n. m2:Map, {a:Int, b:Varchar}\r\n. . a:INT\r\n. . b:Varchar\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when we add `a`, we have to update both the `m1` and `m2` `MaterializedField`s. If we clone the MaterializedField for `m2`, then the old version in `m1` will get out of sync. The result will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nm1:Map, {m2:Map {}}\r\n. m2:Map, {a:Int, b:Varchar}\r\n. . a:INT\r\n. . b:Varchar\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode that depends on accurate schema information then breaks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/396460011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/396462584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1244#issuecomment-396462584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1244","id":396462584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjQ2MjU4NA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-12T04:31:58Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T04:32:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vrozov, your proposed solution works for the single-level map case. It does *not* work for the two-level map case as the `MaterializedField` used inside the inner map is not the one passed from the outer map. Hacky code would be needed to pass in the `MaterializedField`, then fetch it to add it to the outer map's `MaterializedField`.\r\n\r\nAnd, even the above hack does not work for three-level maps.\r\n\r\nSo, what else can we do? We can note one additional problem with maps. If we simply take a map field `m` from batch B1 and use it to create a map in batch B2, we have a dilemma. The `m` `MaterializedField` already contains \"child\" entries for `a` and `b`, say.\r\n\r\nA similar issue exists for any vector with structure: VarChar (offsets and data), Nullable (bits and data), etc.\r\n\r\nSo, what to do? The new code, of which this PR is a part, faced similar difficulties with the additional complexity of the `ResultSetLoader` which must clone a vector to produce the \"overflow\" vector. (This is the reason for fixing the Nullable vectors so that the data vector has its type changed to Required, so that the vector clone works correctly.)\r\n\r\nSo, we get our solution. Clone the `MaterializedField` in the `PartitionSender` *before* calling `BasicTypeHelper.getNewVector`.\r\n\r\nWe might thing that `getNewVector()` can do the clone. But, it is used by `ResultSetLoader` assuming that the new vector will use the `MaterializedField` provided. And, in the vast number of cases, we don't need a clone.\r\n\r\nIt is only when using one vector to create another that we need the clone, so it must be done in the caller. In this case, that is `PartitionSender`.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? Maybe the easiest thing is to just make the change and do a test run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/396462584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/396462788","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1244#issuecomment-396462788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1244","id":396462788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjQ2Mjc4OA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-12T04:33:49Z","updated_at":"2018-06-12T04:33:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vrozov, by the way thanks for taking the time to work on this -- a huge help since I can't run the functional tests myself.\r\n\r\nIf all this seems overly complex, I agree that it is.

I should be able to make most of the changes you've asked for.\r\nWe'll need to inform devs about this as well. \r\nHowever, i have a second problem related to DRILL-4699, which can be easily built off this. The descriptions are very lengthy and break the console formatting when applying to the `sys.options` table. To make things more confusing, there is now a `sys.options_val` table as well ! I'm in favor of replacing the `sys.options` with the `sys.options_val` implementation. So, I'm going to slightly revise this PR in anticipation of an additional PR for DRILL-4699, where the same/similar resource can be used for displaying a shorter description.

I think there are two possible approaches to fixing this (possible more):\r\n\r\n  1. If we are in the middle of the shutdown and we experience and OOM we give up and forcibly terminate with System.halt\r\n  2. We interrupt the shtudown thread and add logic to check for fatal errors during graceful shutdown. If a fatal error is detected during graceful shutdown we can stop waiting for queries and finish.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the approach we take, we should resolving this corner case as a separate jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-6497. The original issue that users experienced was a Drillbit hanging when an OOM was encountered during normal operation, not during shutdown. Also looking at the stacktrace that users provided, this PR fixes the issue in the problematic code path. I think it's a good step forward. And as we discussed previously there are many other issues with child threads not properly propagating exceptions and errors, so there much more work do be done in this area that is outside the scope of this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/397461499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/397466246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1279#issuecomment-397466246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1279","id":397466246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzQ2NjI0Ng==","user":{"login":"kkhatua","id":4335237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4335237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua","html_url":"https://github.com/kkhatua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkhatua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T23:15:41Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T23:15:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@arina-ielchiieva  / @parthchandra \r\n\r\nModified the PR with additional work:\r\n1.

BatchHolders default to 64k rows. This change addresses this issue, my only comment is so not change the batch holder size dynamically.\r\n 2. Limit output batch size.\r\n\r\nI think limiting output batch size should be treated independently from the BatchHolder size. When we output batches we must do some additional math to pick the correct number of rows from the BatchHolders. This is because the BatchHolders contains a variety of different data that our statistics did not accurately capture at the time we picked the BatchHolder size. I agree that the solution for problem (2) should be dynamic, and in fact we can have an accurate solution for it since we know the BatchHolders we are getting the records from to create output batches.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/398439832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/398502707","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1314#issuecomment-398502707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1314","id":398502707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODUwMjcwNw==","user":{"login":"priteshm","id":1015719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1015719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm","html_url":"https://github.com/priteshm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priteshm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-19T18:39:42Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T18:39:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@gparai
