understand your concerns. Indeed there's no growing with T2 observed without these changes, but there's growing with MXOSRVR. However, like I said, I have mem tracing code, of course includes all these new changes, shows no leaking already (about 3 leaking before, fixed already in the latest commit). So my suspicious is, probably there's inappropriate calls of CLI(maybe some descriptor or statement is not close, or anything else, I have no idea, there's no reference for CLI calls...), and it might cause something in executor during the statements's execution time like @sandhyasun said. T2 rowsets functionality uses a group of CLI calls like MXOSRVR does, slightly different(so looks like T2 is growing faster, or maybe it's just because it's multi-threaded, and all \"connections\" resident in one single process on the same machine). That's the only way that I can think of now, if you have anyother way out of this, surely  that would be great.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/230661372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/230661953","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/177#issuecomment-230661953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/177","id":230661953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDY2MTk1Mw==","user":{"login":"ryzuo","id":7919914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTk5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7919914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo","html_url":"https://github.com/ryzuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryzuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T03:22:37Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T03:22:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"[mem_N_stmt_logs.zip](https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/files/348988/mem_N_stmt_logs.zip)\n\nThese are the mem trace log and a statement trace log files last time I ran.
