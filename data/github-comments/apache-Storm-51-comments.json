Otherwise, as there is no backpressure, there will be message loss during the bootup phase. If it is un unacked topology, the message loss is permanent; if it is an acked topology, we will need to do unnecessary replay. \nb) When target worker disappears in the middle(crash?), the source worker should drop the messages directly.\n\nThe problem is that: transport layer don't know by itself whether the target worker is \"booting up\" or \"crashed in the running phase\", so it cannot smartly choose between \"back pressure\" or \"drop\".\n\nIf the transport simplifiy choose \"block\", it is good for \"booting up\" phase, but bad for \"running phase\". If one connection is down, it may block messages sent to other connections.\nIf the transport simplify choose \"drop\", it is good for \"running phase\", but bad for \"booting up\" phase. If the target worker is booted 30 seconds later, all message between this 30 seconds will be dropped. \n\nThe changes in \"worker.clj\" is targeted to solve this problem.\nWorker knows when the target worker connections are ready.\nIn the bootup phase, worker.clj will wait target worker connection is ready, then it will activate the source worker tasks.\nIn the “runtime phase\", the transport will simply drop the messages if target worker crashed in the middle.\n\nThere will be several benefits:\n1. During cluster bootup, for unacked topology, there will be no strange message loss.\n2. During cluster bootup, for acked topology, it can take less time to reach the normal throughput, as there is no message loss, timeout, and replay.\n3. For transport layer, the design is simplified.

Otherwise, as there is no backpressure, there will be message loss during the bootup phase. If it is un unacked topology, the message loss is permanent; if it is an acked topology, we will need to do unnecessary replay. <br/>\n    b) When target worker disappears in the middle(crash?), the source worker should drop the messages directly.</p>\n\n<p>    The problem is that: transport layer don't know by itself whether the target worker is \"booting up\" or \"crashed in the running phase\", so it cannot smartly choose between \"back pressure\" or \"drop\".</p>\n\n<p>    If the transport simplifiy choose \"block\", it is good for \"booting up\" phase, but bad for \"running phase\". If one connection is down, it may block messages sent to other connections.<br/>\n    If the transport simplify choose \"drop\", it is good for \"running phase\", but bad for \"booting up\" phase. If the target worker is booted 30 seconds later, all message between this 30 seconds will be dropped. </p>\n\n<p>    The changes in \"worker.clj\" is targeted to solve this problem.<br/>\n    Worker knows when the target worker connections are ready.<br/>\n    In the bootup phase, worker.clj will wait target worker connection is ready, then it will activate the source worker tasks.<br/>\n    In the “runtime phase\", the transport will simply drop the messages if target worker crashed in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>    There will be several benefits:<br/>\n    1. During cluster bootup, for unacked topology, there will be no strange message loss.<br/>\n    2. During cluster bootup, for acked topology, it can take less time to reach the normal throughput, as there is no message loss, timeout, and replay.<br/>\n    3.

href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=fmazoyer\">fmazoyer</a>:</i>\n<p>Thanks a lot for answering my question and for your comments <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/></p>\n\n<p>So this is my understanding of the behaviour of storm.py :</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">  storm nimbus|supervisor|...\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>will eventually run :</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">  java ... -Dlogback.configurationFile=<path>/cluster.xml ...\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>As far as the daemons (nimbus, supervisor...) are concerned, this </p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\"> -Dlogback.configurationFile </pre>\n</div></div>\n<p> is 'opaquely' passed on to the JVM and processed by the logback library directly.<br/>\nThe supervisor process itself is no exception to the rule, except that supervisor.clj forks the worker daemons, with the following parameter:</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">(str <span class=\"code-quote\">\"-Dlogback.configurationFile=\"</span> storm-home file-path-separator <span class=\"code-quote\">\"logback\"</span> file-path-separator <span class=\"code-quote\">\"worker.xml\"</span>)\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>If we keep the same mechanism, we have to somehow provide the path to the logback configuration directory (that would be the same as the one where cluster.xml is, that's right).</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I guess we will agree on the fact that:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>We need to get the storm.logback.conf.dir from storm.yaml in storm.py, let's call it \n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\"> get_logback_conf_dir() </pre>\n</div></div></li>\n\t<li>For each daemon, we can pass on to the JVM: \n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\"> <span class=\"code-quote\">\"-Dlogback.configurationFile=\"</span> + get_logback_conf_dir() + <span class=\"code-quote\">\"/cluster.xml\"</span> </pre>\n</div></div></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Now we may disagree on that <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/>:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>For the supervisor daemon, pass on to the JVM:\n   <div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">  \n   <span class=\"code-quote\">\"-Dstorm.logback.conf.dir=\"</span> + get_logback_conf_dir(),\n   <span class=\"code-quote\">\"-Dlogback.configurationFile=\"</span> + get_logback_conf_dir() + <span class=\"code-quote\">\"/cluster.xml\"</span>\n   </pre>\n</div></div></li>\n\t<li>In launch-worker in supervisor.clj, add the following lines:\n   <div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">  ...\n  (let ...\n      storm-logback-conf-dir (or (<span class=\"code-object\">System</span>/getProperty <span class=\"code-quote\">\"storm.logback.conf.dir\"</span>) (str storm-home file-path-separator <span class=\"code-quote\">\"logback\"</span>))\n  ...\n  command (concat ...\n  ...\n      (str <span class=\"code-quote\">\"-Dlogback.configurationFile=\"</span> storm-logback-conf-dir file-path-separator <span class=\"code-quote\">\"worker.xml\"</span>)\n  ...\n    </pre>\n</div></div></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Hope I'm not leaving anything out.</p>\n\n<p>What do you reckon ?<br/>\nThanks a lot for your time <img class=\"emoticon\"
