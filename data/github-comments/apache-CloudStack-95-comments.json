I know, you may argue that the method âupdateTemplateTagInformationâ has a conditional in âTemplateJoinDaoImplâ and âVolumeJoinDaoImplâ; still, that conditional is executed with some additional checks in âUserVmJoinDaoImplâ. The point here is that you should let that conditional out of the method scope, and then extract the method to a place that can be reused in all of those classes. All of them (VolumeJoinDaoImpl, UserVmJoinDaoImpl, and TemplateJoinDaoImpl) extend âGenericDaoBaseâ class. You can easily create a new class that extend âGenericDaoBaseâ, with that âupdateTemplateTagInformationâ and make all of those classes extend this new one. Please, keep that in mind in your next PRs.\n\nThat same is happening for VolumeJoinVO, UserVmJoinVO, and TemplateJoinVO classes. All of them have attributes âtagAccountNameâ, âtagDomainUuidâ and âtagDomainNameâ and their respective getters and setters. They all extend âBaseViewVOâ, you can do that same trick I mentioned you above here.\n\nNow about the tests. First, when writing tests, you should ask yourself, âWhat am I going to test?â, âIf this method changes the behavior would I like to catch it?â, âWhat is the behavior I want to monitor?â. Those are the basic questions.\n\nI believe your tests, should test the method âupdateTemplateTagInformationâ that you wrote. Then, the aforementioned questions can be used; what changes do you want to detect? if that method stops setting a property? Do you want to detect if it sets a property in a wrong place? If you want those things, your tests now are not adequate, if you do not want them, you should delete the tests classes.\n\nI personally believe that the method deserves tests to check if it is working as expected. Meaning, that checking if it sets the properties you want in the right place.\n\nAdditionally, when writing tests try to code as little as possible. Variables âaccountServiceâ and âconfigDaoâ are not needed to test the âupdateTemplateTagInformationâ; keep in mind that is a unit test. To test âupdateTemplateTagInformationâ you only need a simple instance of âTemplateJoinDaoImplâ and a mock of âApiDBUtils.newResourceTagResponse(vtag, false)â\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/191455410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/191930272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1425#issuecomment-191930272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1425","id":191930272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTkzMDI3Mg==","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-03T19:40:25Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T19:40:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner @pedro-martins I followed your suggestions and made a big refactor, hope this would be better now.

Although it might be a bit tricky, I believe that the ideal solution would be to check for the hypervisor version; if it is 4.1/4.0 then the default value of 8 is changed to 256 (or any recommended amount for the given version). This way does not rely on admin to manually configure it (the idea would be to consider the global configuration if the admin set it, would just change a default value).\n\nI checked and maybe a method for check the hypervisor version and set the **_portsPerDvPortGroup** could be called by **com.cloud.hypervisor.vmware.manager.VmwareManagerImpl.addHostToPodCluster(VmwareContext, long, Long, Long, String)**. This method would search a host using the clusterId (**com.cloud.host.dao.HostDaoImpl.findByClusterId(Long)**); with the given HostVO it verifies the hypervisor version (**com.cloud.host.HostVO.getHypervisorVersion()**) to set the default value according this version.\n\nThanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/192951641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/192958023","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/977#issuecomment-192958023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/977","id":192958023,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5Mjk1ODAyMw==","user":{"login":"ustcweizhou","id":3204966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDQ5NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3204966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou","html_url":"https://github.com/ustcweizhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ustcweizhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-06T18:38:38Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T18:38:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kiwiflyer Simon, Thanks for your bug report, I will fix it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/192958023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/193063329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/561#issuecomment-193063329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/561","id":193063329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzA2MzMyOQ==","user":{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T02:30:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T02:30:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Shouldn't the class throw a less generic Exception?
