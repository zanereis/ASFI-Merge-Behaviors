user.  But I don't think it solves the issue if authentication with nimbus still.  No matter how we run the user code it still needs to authenticate with nimbus.  We need to give the that code credentials to do so.  We cannot use the UI user's credentials to do it because the end user could steal them, unless we do something where we hand the code a nimbus connection that is already authenticated and locked down in such a way that nimbus will enforce it being the user that we want.  But that code does not currently exist, either on the client side or not the nimbus side.</p>\n\n<p>If we are going to make big changes like that I would much rather have us look at flux, and see if we can submit a topology with a jar, and a config file.  Possibly having both of them in a single jar file.  Instead of having the bolts and spouts deserialized in the worker, we could call a constructor and instantiate them directly in the worker, like what flux does.  There is already a thrift definition for some of this, but I am not sure how advanced/tested it is, or what changes we would need to make to flux to support it.  With this we no longer need to run any user code outside of the worker at all, or load an untrusted jar file.  We just read the config file and submit the topology using the proxy settings.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612518966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612578931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4775#issuecomment-2612578931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4775","id":2612578931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI1Nzg5MzE=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-14T16:53:16Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T13:51:16Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

We have to store the batch ID somewhere to make this work, but we need a way to dedupe the data, either on the read side or as part of the commit  If we store the batch ID with each tuple and do nothing on the commit side the consumer of the data has to dedup duplicate batches.  We can do that on the read side but we essentially have to dedupe everything in the data set, even previously processed data, and hope that the storm code produced the exact same result each time or else we could end up with a problem.  Because of the complexity of doign this right, and the fact that we would put this burden on the end user I personally would rather see two files employed and we dedupe on the commit side.  One file is for writing out data, and the second file is batch ID index into the first file.</p>\n\n<p>In the simplest case the second file is just an edit log and can be thrown away when the commit is complete.</p>\n\n<p>beginCommit would write out to the edit log that batch X is starting at file Y offset Z and flush to be sure it is on disk.<br/>\nupdate would write out the data similar to what it does now.<br/>\ncommit would at least flush the data file and possibly close and rotate it to the final location, and would write out to the edit log that batch X is finished at file Y offset whatever.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting code would all be in the error handling.</p>\n\n<p>If the state comes up and it sees existing files that have not been rotated it needs to recover any batches that were committed but not rotated to the final location.<br/>\nIf beginCommit is called without the previous batch ID being committed {<br/>\n    if the commit ID is the same as the current batch ID, we need to recover the batches that succeeded but have not been rotated, then continue on as normal<br/>\n    else if the commit ID is not the same as the current batch ID we disable writing any data out until the current batch ID fully commits. <br/>\n}<br/>\nif beginCommit is called for a batchID that we already completed we disable output until we move on to the next batch ID.</p>\n\n<p>There may be other cases that we need to think about too, I just threw this out as a starting point.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612560548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/121749743","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/630#issuecomment-121749743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/630","id":121749743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTc0OTc0Mw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-15T21:13:54Z","updated_at":"2015-07-15T21:13:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am fine with whichever timeout we pick.
