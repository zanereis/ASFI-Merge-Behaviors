This is basically what you are going for. You want some files to be written with an \"unpartitioned\" spec and the optimizations to occur with a \"partitioned spec\".\r\n\r\nSo what you want to do for this table is first take note of the specId of your partitioned spec. You can read this out of table.specs() which is a map. This is the specId you want to use for optimizing. I'm not sure if trino supports optimizing to a particular spec id yet, but if they don't that's not a problem. \r\n\r\nNext create an unpartitioned spec. You can do this by altering the table and removing all partitioning columns. This should give you another spec in `table.specs()`. Take note of this number as well. If you like you can set the current spec back to the first partitioned specId by adding the partition fields back.\r\n\r\nNow we should have\r\n\r\nunpartitionedSpecID\r\nand \r\npartitioneSpecID\r\n\r\nWhatever is `current-spec-id` will be used by default by write operations and optimizes and any other operation on the table. There are two options to use this information:\r\n\r\n1. Current Spec Id => Partitioned. Whenever you write using the java api and unpartitioned writer use unpartitionedSpecID to get the unpartitioned spec associated with this table. Optimize without any options which will use the default partitioned spec.\r\n\r\n2. Current Spec Id = Unpartitioned. Whenever you optimize use the partitioned spec Id as an option so that rewritten data always becomes partitioned.  Write new data using the current spec `table.spec()`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1671376847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1671405177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8269#issuecomment-1671405177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8269","id":1671405177,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85jn555","user":{"login":"kamijin-fanta","id":1541187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDExODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1541187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta","html_url":"https://github.com/kamijin-fanta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamijin-fanta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-09T14:09:18Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T14:09:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Isn't this a bug?

I would say the bug could be that we should throw an error if you use unpartitioned writer with a partitioned spec. I believe previously this was allowed because V1 Iceberg tables don't ever remove spec fields, they just get changed to void transforms and for a while our code had some very specific wonky logic around that sometimes. You basically could have unpartitioned spec `<>` and  unpartitioned spec `<Void>` and unpartitioned spec `<Void, Void>` and so on. I think this may be an artifact of that. Now we have a safe \"isUnpartitioned\" function so we could just put that as a perquisite in the Unpartitioned writer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1671414514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1671481858","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8130#issuecomment-1671481858","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8130","id":1671481858,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85joMoC","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-09T14:27:31Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T14:27:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If it is the planning phase there isn't much to do since most of the cost is in reading the manifests. With 4000 files there are most likely many many manifests. You can try increasing the size of the manifest reading thread pool to increase parallelism there but it's best to just optimize manfiests more regularly and take the cost for one long optimize to start with. I would also highly recommend running optimize data files more frequently as well if you have 4000 files that only take up 5 gb.\r\n\r\nIf it's in the delete phase you just need to enable bulk deletes, this is default in newer versions of Iceberg. In older versions of Iceberg there was an explicit delete parallelism parameter for expire snapshots and delete orphan files. If you are on an older version set these parameters to a high number like 50 or 100. If delete are taking a long time it's probably latency of getting the delete response which is taking so long.

Happy to also help with the writing structuring.\r\n\r\nOne could initially have it as follows:\r\n\r\nWhat benefit does one have to use Apache Iceberg with Geospatial data instead of using, for instance, simply [geoparquet](https://geoparquet.org/)? I would think about:\r\n* Support writing of individual rows (this can be useful in streaming scenarios, e.g. Internet of Thing devices communicating their position).\r\n* Natively already query the geospatial data without manual/error-prone conversion (e.g. using right CRS when loading etc.) and by having a much higher performance\r\n... maybe you have some other motivations why you started geolake?\r\n\r\nOne can also think about other features (would not add them in the first spec due to complexity):\r\n* Partition of data according to spatial (location) criteria (see also: https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet/issues/13#issuecomment-1057437189), which seems to be supported by Geolake (I wonder can we instead/additionally use the z-ordering feature of Iceberg to reuse the Iceberg functionality?)\r\n* Loading/Storing rasters (at the moment all proposals, including geoparquet, include only vector data), more complex, the raster should be split in equal small tiles et.\r\n\r\n\r\nI suggest that a public Google Doc is started and that one can add what it would mean for Iceberg to support Geospatial support, e.g.:\r\n* Augmentation of the Iceberg Spec (https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/)\r\n   * Update Data type to include Geometry (https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#schemas-and-data-types), probably it should be internally based on geoarrow (https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow/) - or maybe you have some idea based on your Geolake implementation?\r\n   * Requirements for storage formats (Suggest to focus in the initial release only on parquet as it the only one which has geoparquet defined, but in future releases one could also include avro, orc using a similar specification as geoparquet)\r\n   * ...\r\n* Interdependencies to tools \r\n  * Apache Sedona - how can we make sure that the Geometry column is compatible (should we reuse the Sedona Geometry class? Or should we provide as a pull request to Sedona a Spark function that does the conversion?).
