It would be good if we can solve it in a simple way. However, you pr would bring some side effects. \r\n\r\nBasically, Flink returns timestamp in UTC+0. With your pr, the output time is a local timestamp for proctime. However, you only changed one place about how to represent a timestamp. There are a lot of other places still return timestamp in UTC+0 which would **bring confusion and inconsistency**. \r\n\r\nFlink also returns and only returns local timestamp in functions that **clearly** indicate that the time of the return type is a local timestamp, such as the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` function. `String sqlQuery = \"select proctime, LOCALTIMESTAMP from MyTable\";` This is why offset is added in the place of the link you have provided.\r\n\r\nBest, Hequn","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/450556445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/450559457","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7180#issuecomment-450559457","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7180","id":450559457,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDU1OTQ1Nw==","user":{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-30T13:04:49Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T13:04:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hequn8128, Ok, I see. thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/450559457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/450562517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7384#issuecomment-450562517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7384","id":450562517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDU2MjUxNw==","user":{"login":"wujinhu","id":6348524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDg1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu","html_url":"https://github.com/wujinhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wujinhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-30T13:58:24Z","updated_at":"2018-12-30T13:58:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StefanRRichter Please help to review this PR, thanks.\r\nI will upload test results after you review this PR.\r\n**Notice**: I do not change tests of **flink-swift-fs-hadoop** because I do not have the corresponding environment.

Thus, I think it may be improper to enable QS service by checking the registeredKvStates, and should by user explicit
