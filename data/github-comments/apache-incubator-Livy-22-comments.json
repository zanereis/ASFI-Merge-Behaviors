So, rather than looking for app in any namespace [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/blob/1f6bd7ab55db3e5b08ff133d554b32db83a23890/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/livy/utils/SparkKubernetesApp.scala#L689), it should be namespaced.\r\n\r\nThe namespace need to be passed from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/blob/1f6bd7ab55db3e5b08ff133d554b32db83a23890/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/livy/server/batch/BatchSession.scala#L109\r\n\r\nThere are couple of options on how we do this:\r\n1. Add a namespace argument to SparkApp.create() call. This changes the create() function definition which is generic for both YarnApp and KubernetesApp. \r\n2. To avoid modifying create() call, we can put namespace as part of LivyConf and pass a copy of this rather than actual ref. This will have minimal changes but technically namespace should not be part of LivyConf. \r\n\r\n@jahstreet @askhatri Please let me know your thoughts and i can implement it accordingly.
