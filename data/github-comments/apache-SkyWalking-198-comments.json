Thanks!\r\n\r\n@bigwalnut I don't think you can simply configure `SW_CORE_GRPC_HOST` or `SW_CORE_REST_HOST` to `100.65.136.30` because this IP is in your host machine, what you should do is to just bind `0.0.0.0` in the docker container, and map the port of that container to your host ip `100.65.136.30` and port `11800`, take a quick try on something like `docker run -p 100.65.136.30:11800:11800 -p 100.65.136.30:12800:12800
