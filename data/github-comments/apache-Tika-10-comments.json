But maybe there's something different about this particular use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/722693051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/722693751","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/372#issuecomment-722693751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/372","id":722693751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjY5Mzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"kkrugler","id":66217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler","html_url":"https://github.com/kkrugler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkrugler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-05T22:59:25Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T22:59:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW @PeterAlfredLee -
