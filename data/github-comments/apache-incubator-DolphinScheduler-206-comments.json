I have studied and found the errors are mainly in the `notifyProcessChanged` method. If `try catch` is used, although the cause of the error is located, the solution cost is high, such as `repeat running` to solve the problem, which wastes time and resources. if transfer to `command`, insert a command to resolve\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29919212/157670893-570f15ad-dd03-4045-bc89-51e0142c1117.png)\r\n\r\nI think add `try catch` and log if exception is OK.
