This PR will increase the number of helium package users significantly. \r\n\r\nI would like to comment about the design of `helium.json`. Basically, It's concise and well designed. \r\n\r\n- It would be great if helium package has `version` field considering local package and `latest`\r\n- If once people start to develop packages, there must be operational things like user complains. For example, \"I published package to npm, but it's not collected by helium for last 2 days. What's the problem?\" So, it's good for each package to have some information for debug and ops like `createdAt`, `heliumFormatVersion`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/276862781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/276863474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1952#issuecomment-276863474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1952","id":276863474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Njg2MzQ3NA==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-02T04:09:57Z","updated_at":"2017-02-02T04:10:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo Nice to have abstracted table structure inside zeppelin.

for GREAT suggestions @1ambda. \r\n\r\n>It would be great if helium package has version field considering local package and latest\r\n\r\nI've just added `version` and `published` field to each pkg version's information. Please check [helium.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json)(used for Zeppelin Helium GUI menu) and [helium.js](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.js)(used for zeppelin.apache.org). I also added `published` date for each version, to show latest package first. So now, it'll be look like below \r\n```\r\n    \"0.0.3\": {\r\n      ...\r\n    }, \r\n    \"latest\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"VISUALIZATION\",\r\n      \"name\": \"zeppelin-bubblechart\",\r\n      \"version\": \"0.0.4\",\r\n      \"published\": \"2017-01-23T20:42:34.373Z\",\r\n      \"artifact\": \"zeppelin-bubblechart@0.0.4\",\r\n      \"author\": \"leemoonsoo\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Animated bubble chart\",\r\n      \"license\": \"BSD-2-Clause\",\r\n      \"icon\": \"<svg viewBox='0 0 70 70'><circle cx='26' cy='28' stroke='black' style='stroke-width: 1px;' r='25' fill='seagreen'/><circle cx='42' cy='44' stroke='black' style='stroke-width: 1px;' r='20' fill='DodgerBlue'/><circle cx='54' cy='24' stroke='black' style='stroke-width: 1px;' r='15' fill='crimson'/></svg>\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the latest update.\r\n![record](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/22551286/90bc376c-e997-11e6-8529-4dde534181d4.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n>If once people start to develop packages, there must be operational things like user complains. For example, \"I published package to npm, but it's not collected by helium for last 2 days. What's the problem?\" So, it's good for each package to have some information for debug and ops like createdAt, heliumFormatVersion.\r\n\r\nEspecially for this, totally agree with you. And seems it's necessary. Actually there are lots of things to be improved and can be changed. So I need more time to rethink about how I can do that in Lambda function side. But as it doesn't affect directly to merge this PR, I'll update it later time if it's okay with you. Appreciate again!
