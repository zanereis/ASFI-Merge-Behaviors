We cannot fix all Drill problems in one PR, so please agree on follow up Jira when possible. Let's target to merge the PR next week.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/415748806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/415760213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1443#issuecomment-415760213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1443","id":415760213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTc2MDIxMw==","user":{"login":"arina-ielchiieva","id":15086720,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDg2NzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15086720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva","html_url":"https://github.com/arina-ielchiieva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arina-ielchiieva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-24T13:34:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T13:34:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@cgivre

It should be sufficient to replace deprecated and unstable classes/methods. So, even though an enormous amount of work was done, I don't see how Drill and drill dev community benefit from that work. I already mentioned that in my review comments and also on the mailing list. IMO, it will be more beneficial for Drill customers to resolve DRILL-6422 and #1264.\r\n\r\n@arina-ielchiieva:\r\n- I don't share your concern with PR being open for a month. In Apache PR may be open for much longer and there are multiple examples of PRs being open for 2, 3 and more month in Drill and other Apache projects.\r\n- I agree that it is not only possible but it is much better not to fix all problems in one PR. In some cases, instead of a follow up JIRA that may never be fixed, I'd prefer to see a pre-cursor JIRA and PR and this PR is an example where I'd like to see several Drill classes being removed or refactored first (due to a larger benefit that I see for removing those classes compared to removing Guava classes).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/415977809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/416000908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1429#issuecomment-416000908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1429","id":416000908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjAwMDkwOA==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-25T22:36:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T22:36:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @ppadma for the review!\r\n\r\nAddressed comments.

The issue is that operators are expecting a column with the name of MYCOLUMN (because that is the name provided by the planner), but instead the input column has a name of `` `MYCOLUMN` ``. This can cause errors at many points in an operator's execution, not just within the RecordBatchSizer's columnSizes map. For example, in HashJoin the HashTable uses the unquoted column names provided by the planner to retrieve the key column from the incoming record batch (See ChainedHashTable.createAndSetupHashTable). So while this fix resolves a fatal exception in the batch sizer, it does not address the issue of functional correctness in other parts of the code like the HashTable which may be silently generating incorrect results.\r\n\r\nIf we close this issue now with a temporary fix, some poor soul may spend weeks debugging strange and unexpected data correctness issues down the line. In order to avoid that scenario and to increase the urgency of fixing the root cause, I am actually thinking that we should leave the bug unfixed until we have a permanent fix for the parquet reader.

the test file, checking that incoming uninitialized input containers (for STOP or NONE outcomes) are handled correctly. (Basically the same test as before, only now calling `next()` twice (as the first call always returns OK_NEW_SCHEMA)). \r\n   A small fix was needed for the hash join, as in the case the first real incoming batch was NONE, the second `next()` was returning an OK (with 0 rows).

Is an Index Out Of Bounds Exception (IOBE) an expected behavior for this context? Or, does it indicate a bug in the code? Normally, code is expected to know the array size, and index only within that size, meaning that an IOBE is a program error.\r\n\r\nBy presenting the error to the user in the nicely-formatted way introduced in this code, we seem to be implying that this is something the user needs to worry about. Yet, if this is a program error, we should say that this is a System Error and they need to contact Support for resolution.\r\n\r\nNote also that for unexpected program errors, there is a well-defined generic way we catch exceptions in the Fragment Executor. The Fragment Executor is the handler of last resort, will report an error, and will shut down the fragment.\r\n\r\nSo, basic question: what is the source of the IOBE? If the IOBE is a program error, do we need the fancy handling if the Fragment Executor handles such errors? And, if the IOBE indicates a problem the user can resolve, should the error messages indicate a possible resolution? What might that problem be? Corrupted database? Incorrect SQL? Update done concurrently with a query? Something else?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/418200233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/418324098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1455#issuecomment-418324098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1455","id":418324098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODMyNDA5OA==","user":{"login":"KazydubB","id":38408110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDA4MTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38408110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB","html_url":"https://github.com/KazydubB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KazydubB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T10:53:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T10:54:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@paul-rogers, possible sources of IOBE here is when allocating value vector buffers or reading records from input.

You are inserting code everywhere you believe an IOBE could be thrown. Since the exception is due to a coding error, you should, in theory, wrap all possible places. But, one could apply this same argument to NPE, division by zero and other programing errors. Soon, every line of code must be wrapped to catch programming errors.\r\n\r\nAnd, what can the user do? Only call support or post to the dev list. We then look at logs: the stack trace, an create a test case.\r\n\r\nSo, we could adopt a more general approach:\r\n\r\n* If the error is something the user can correct (bad name, external system problem, resource problem), log a detailed error for the user. Catch the problem close to the cause so we can provide context.\r\n* If the error is a programming problem, catch it generically in the fragment executor. The original exception has the stack trace with is what the developer needs to fix the issue. Tell the user, \"System error -- contact your vendor. Preserve drillbit.log for host foo.bar.com and provide it to the developer.\"\r\n\r\nIf we do that, then your wrapper code is not needed unless it indicates an error the user can fix. Instead, improve the wording of the generic \"something went wrong\" error in the fragment executor.\r\n\r\nThat is, there is no reason to add complexity to the code to try to handle all possible programming errors. Instead, focus that effort on better testing to find and fix such errors. Said another way, the code being added assumes errors exist, we don't know about them, and the user would like lots of details about how we screwed up in the code. That is, IMHO, an incorrect read. Uses want working code, and want to know how to correct errors due to their application or environment.\r\n\r\nNote that this is policy is not unique to each plugin. Rather, it is a project-wide guideline that might want to be discussed on the dev list.
