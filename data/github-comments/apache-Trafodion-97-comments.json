you please add some queries that use these functions to some regression test? Don't sleep too long, though :-) You may need to add a filter to mask out the random digits in the UUIDs.\r\n\r\nAlso, you probably found this out already, Trafodion does not give any guarantees over where it places these functions. Let's say you have a table t with 1000 rows and you issue this query:\r\n\r\nselect uuid(), sleep(1) from t;\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee that you get 1000 different uuids back or 1000 clones of the same one. Also, the query may sleep some amount other than 1 or 1000 units. The outcome depends on the query and maybe other factors such as CQDs. This makes these functions not as useful as they seem and that's why the designers of the SQL language have stayed away from non-deterministic functions and functions with side-effects.\r\n\r\nIf you create scalar UDFs for such functions you have some limited control via the \"NOT DETERMINISTIC\" attribute, as you probably have already seen in TRAFODION-2912. That is the better approach, but it comes with a performance penalty.\r\n\r\nHere is a use case that many people may want to have, so it would be good to allow it:\r\n\r\ncreate table t(id char(36) not null default uuid());\r\n\r\nAgain, it is not easy to guarantee that every row inserted into the table will get its own uuid. So, at second thought, don't allow this unless you ensure that you get a unique column this way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/366112424/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/366114562","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1444#issuecomment-366114562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1444","id":366114562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjExNDU2Mg==","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T01:02:08Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T01:02:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another example:\r\n```\r\nselect * from t1 join t2 on t1.ts = t2.ts\r\nwhere t1.ts between unix_timestamp() - 1000 and unix_timestamp() - 800;\r\n```\r\nQueries like this may give you complete nonsense back.

Hans, yes, the uuid() and sleep() may have issues as you described. The major usage of uuid is to be used as the default function for column definition. But you are right, it could be used in a select list or anywhere a function is allowed and the output is deterministic. Let me add these in the documentation and add some regression test. The reason I didn't add tests is because they are random, but as you suggested, the output can be filtered out.\r\nFor unix_timestamp(), it is just like the currenttimestamp(), as I understand, the approach trafodion using is to have them using same value id in a single query, and each occurrence of them should invoke once and represent identical value. But I didn't strictly test it. Let me add test case, and do more check on this.\r\nThese are very excellent and knowledgeable comments. I never thought in this way.

If you want to use uuid() as the default in DDL, that is one case where we might be able to give a guarantee, with some special code. Maybe you can look at the code for identity columns and the code that generates the SYSKEY and take a somewhat similar approach for uuid. However, since identity columns and SYSKEY are actual columns, you won't be able to solve it in exactly the same way. It might have been easier to initialize a column to a uuid in a different way, without using a function (and maybe you can under the covers handle the uuid default that way). You can then still keep the function and just document that it behaves in unpredictable ways.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/366288941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/366327605","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1449#issuecomment-366327605","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1449","id":366327605,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjMyNzYwNQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-16T18:59:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T18:59:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

My main concern is that methods like RelExpr::pushdownCoveredExpr() (the main method that decides where to evaluate an expression) may decide to evaluate the uuid() function on the parent rather than push it down. The uuid() function requires no inputs, so it can be evaluated anywhere, and the normalizer is completely free to choose a location for the evaluation. This is all done based on heuristics, and the code gets very complicated, especially when VEGies are involved.\r\n\r\nAnother problem comes from how the SQL standard is defined. SQL is a descriptive language and leaves the optimizer lots of choices. Let's say I have a table T with n rows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect *\r\nfrom T x, T y\r\nwhere x.a = y.a + sleep(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe standard says that _effectively_, we form the Cartesian product of the tables (T and T, in this case) and evaluate the where clause on it. If you take this literally, we would have to sleep n ** 2 seconds for this query. However, we generally assume ItemExprs like + and = and also sleep() to be deterministic and without side-effects, so we use something like a hash join that evaluates the where clause much less often than n**2 times. But, a function with side-effects like sleep() violates the definition of \"effectively\". This is just a very simple example.\r\n\r\nHere is another:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith x as (select uuid() from T)\r\nselect count(distinct *)\r\nfrom (x union all x) x2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf table T has n rows, what's the answer to this query, n or 2n? As you probably know, with Trafodion you probably get 2n by default, but set some CQDs and suddenly you may get n.\r\n\r\nThese are somewhat esoteric examples, but if you get into more complex queries like TPC-DS, you may run into similar issues quite frequently.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm fine with these functions as long as we make it very clear that they are not well-defined and should not be used beyond very simple queries.\r\n\r\nWhat we would need to do this right are \"not deterministic\" and \"external action\" attributes of functions. We have \"not deterministic\" for UDFs, but we don't honor this attribute in every case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/367063104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/367063872","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1449#issuecomment-367063872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1449","id":367063872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzA2Mzg3Mg==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T18:00:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T18:00:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes.
