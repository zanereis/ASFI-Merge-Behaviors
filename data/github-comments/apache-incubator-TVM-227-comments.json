error message is:\r\n```\r\nOMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libiomp5.dylib already initialized.\r\nOMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.

okay, i've iterated on this with @rkimball and it's a little more complex. I was previously working on this problem when i was trying to make TVM RPC server run GDB. To do that, I installed a custom SIGINT handler in Python which only raised KeyboardInterrupt if GDB had died. \r\n\r\nit turns out this all boils down to `siginterrupt()`, which Python implicitly calls when you set a custom signal handler and also exposes to Python programs as `signal.siginterrupt`. I was able to reproduce the behavior I saw in @rkimball's demo by adding this code to main():\r\n```\r\nif (siginterrupt(SIGINT, 1) == -1) {\r\n  perror(\"siginterrupt\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfinally, the root of the problem: why does Python care about `EINTR` and `siginterrupt`? See [PEP 475](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/), which explains that basically handling is specific to even the particular Python code that's running on top of TVM. Python provides a callback function, `PyErr_CheckSignals`, and C extensions are supposed to invoke that function if `EINTR` is seen to decide whether to return. This is how Ctrl+C is handled in Python when a C extension is blocked in a syscall. To handle this properly within `libtvm.so` then, we need to provide some generic e.g. PackedFunc callback that frontends can set to define the `EINTR` behavior. This didn't seem worth it when I was just trying to run GDB on an RPC server, but it does now.

The changes made were explained in PR #5339. So in the original implementation, `get_valid_count` will rearrange the invalid boxes to the end of the array while in the updated implementation, this movement is done by `argsort` to improve the performance. `valid_count` is changed to initialized to `None` in order to let `argsort` sort the entire array instead of only the first `valid_count` number of elements. Since `argsort` doesn't make changes to `valid_count`, I'm not sure why running `nms` multiple times will manifest the number of valid boxes.
