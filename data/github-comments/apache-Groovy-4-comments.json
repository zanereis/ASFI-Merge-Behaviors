Running this on Groovy 2.4.5 with IBM's implementation of Java SE 8 shows a memory leak (with -Xmx256m it throws `OutOfMemoryError` in a few minutes).  If I add the system property `-Dgroovy.use.classvalue=true` the memory leak is fixed and the testcase runs indefinitely with no problems.\n\nI think this shows that the `java.lang.ClassValue` code @candrews added for Java 7+ works as designed on IBM's runtime.\n\nTest.java:\n\n``` java\npackage demo;\n\nimport groovy.lang.GroovyShell;\n\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n\n            new Thread(new Runnable() {\n\n                @Override\n                public void run() {\n\n                    long i = 0;\n                    while (true) {\n                        new GroovyShell().evaluate(i + \" * 2\", \"Script_\" + i);\n                        i++;\n\n                    }\n                }\n\n            }).start();\n        }\n\n        while (true);\n    }\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/147346962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/comments/147469212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/135#issuecomment-147469212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/135","id":147469212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzQ2OTIxMg==","user":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-12T17:31:00Z","updated_at":"2015-10-12T17:31:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just started the vote.

The order must not matter. If it does, then there is a bug in the code that works only with a certain order. And that's the part that needs fixing with either a sorting there or not depending on sorting at all.  Furthermore, the patch addresses code of precompiled classes generated from a class object. We have also ClassNodes objects from code currently under compilation and from classes stored in jars and read by asm. Nothing in this patch asserts the order in those cases, and I think there should not be as well. As the patch is now I must fear, that if the classes inside of Groovy7363Support or moved into the assertScript part, that the test will fail again.
