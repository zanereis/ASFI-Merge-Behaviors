For JarClassLoader, as an example, it could come from anywhere, in client code that we don't control, for instance in a NetBeans plugin or a platform application--or simply other IDE modules that shouldn't need to change as a result of this change. For instance, a task running in an interruptible RequestProcessor may receive an interrupt if RequestProcessor.cancel() is called while the task is running (and if this is enabled in the RequestProcessor's constructor).\r\n\r\n> Being able to intercept for example class loading over a broken URL (with an unresponsive host for example), sounds like an improvement.\r\n\r\nYes, absolutely. That's why RequestProcessor supports this, for instance. But for this to work, the each piece of possibly-interruptible code must be reviewed and/or changed to make sure the interrupted case is handled specially. For example, in the JarClassLoader case, we could theoretically do the same as when the class is not found at all--but what if higher-level code then caches this negative result, and decides never to try to load that class again? That would be bad if the interruption happened simply because the I/O operation was taking a little bit of time. And these kinds of bugs would be very hard to track down, since they would only happen every once in a while, basically at random.\r\n\r\nThe only safe thing to do, absent an API that explicitly says \"the result of this method should not be cached\" or \"this method may throw an InterruptedException\", is to force the request to finish despite the interrupt, but then making sure to leave the thread interrupt bit on before returning. That's what the old FileInputStream/FileOutputStream did.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423650130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423690320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/895#issuecomment-423690320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/895","id":423690320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzY5MDMyMA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T22:47:00Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T22:47:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 Cool.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423690320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423692200","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/886#issuecomment-423692200","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/886","id":423692200,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzY5MjIwMA==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-21T22:59:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T22:59:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I tested the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. open the module\r\n2. right-click the functional test file e.g. J2eeProjectsTest.java\r\n3. click \"Test File\"\r\n\r\nMany functional tests seem to fail before the license headers are added...

That's analogous to using empty catch(Exception) constructs.\r\n\r\nHandling exceptions is a responsibility of the caller. If a higher-level code caches a negative result and leaves the system in a bad state, it's a bug in the higher-level code.

Or to put it another way - fix the problems, not the symptoms.\r\n\r\nSo for the alternatives:\r\n1. Fix the callers properly to retry the I/O operation where appropriate\r\n2.

Otherwise, frankly, we may need to revert https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/commit/4b82e6adb31e294c74fd2fa99779ce9e27ae6184 and reintroduce it piece by piece with a proper investigations of what happens when ClosedByInterruptException is thrown.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423803885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423805133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/896#issuecomment-423805133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/896","id":423805133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzgwNTEzMw==","user":{"login":"tmysik","id":331924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/331924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik","html_url":"https://github.com/tmysik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmysik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-23T10:04:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-23T10:04:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junichi11 \r\n\r\nNot sure about the official icon/logo but this is what they use [on their official Twitter](https://twitter.com/phpstan?lang=cs).

Getting threads to interrupt more promptly than before is a \"nice-to-have\", but really a separate enhancement that can be postponed.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, there is a solution which achieves what 4b82e6a intended to achieve (dropping finalize()), without changing interrupt-related behavior: Wrap the NIO streams in new InputStream/OutputStream classes, which delegate to them but which catch and retry on ClosedByInterruptException. Then use these classes in all places where explicit interrupt handling has not been deemed to be safe.\r\n\r\n(See also https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Interrupted-Primitives.html for the equivalent problem in the UNIX world. Retrying on interrupt is the common solution.)\r\n\r\n> Leaving an interrupt flag on is just akin to leaving a message in the error log. Not stopping == ignoring\r\n\r\nAdding one note here--this is not quite true. A long-running client process is typically doing a series of expensive operations in a loop, e.g. indexing 4000 Java files. Each individual I/O operation will only take a few milliseconds. To support interruptions, the client code will check the thread's interrupt bit once before indexing a new file, and abort the operation if the interrupt bit is set. It is perfectly reasonable to require each individual I/O operation to complete, as long as the thread interrupt bit is checked every now and then.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423816771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423819273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/896#issuecomment-423819273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/896","id":423819273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzgxOTI3Mw==","user":{"login":"junichi11","id":738383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/738383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11","html_url":"https://github.com/junichi11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junichi11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-23T14:09:01Z","updated_at":"2018-09-23T14:19:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tmysik \r\n\r\n> if the scope is other then a project (or a project directory), use PHPStan to ask for dependent files and add them to the files to be analuyzed.

Hi, why JUnit BOM is not used in pom.xml for versions and dependencies?

I tried to limit my changes to re-use a lot of what already worked with JUnit 4. \r\n\r\nIt's also a matter of taste, and to me its not a big deal. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423968778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/423970654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/892#issuecomment-423970654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/892","id":423970654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzk3MDY1NA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T13:16:32Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T13:16:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great, and thanks for the screenshots (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Miscellaneous).
