For some users who are not willing to spend some time picking up python but do have tons of workflows to generate, yaml is a better approach than dragging and connecting tasks through the UI. Just curious, why do you want this feature? Are you a `yaml lover`? üòÑ\r\n\r\nIf we can use YAML to manage workflows, it might make it easier for engineers to manage workflows and do version management. Git can be used to manage and share workflows.\r\nIn addition, after communicating with some overseas engineers, I found that some engineers prefer to use YAML to manage programs, which I think is also suitable for me.\r\nI think `yaml` is better than `TOML` or `JSON` for this scenario.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1185584172/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1185623688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11002#issuecomment-1185623688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/11002","id":1185623688,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5Gqy6I","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T14:52:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-18T03:56:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11002?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) Report\n> Merging [#11002](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/11002?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (be29c89) into [dev](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/dolphinscheduler/commit/083ab2b5c9682e6afadefcbc4d5285622a4155d0?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=The+Apache+Software+Foundation) (083ab2b) will **decrease** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n> :exclamation: Current head be29c89 differs from pull request most recent head a1969b3.

Hi @SbloodyS, could you please take several minuates to review the code? Almost finished, one thing left to be confirmed:\r\n> \r\n> I notice there's a folder https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/tree/dev/dolphinscheduler-dao/src/main/resources/sql/upgrade, with lots of subfolders inside (e.g. `2.0.4_schema`), does that means these will be excuted when a user, with 2.0.4 installed, trying to upgrade dolphin to the latest release?\r\n> \r\n> If so, I think every files in this folder need add one line to alter the alert group table to add one additional column.\r\n\r\nIs it appropriate to put it in 3.1.0? @zhongjiajie @caishunfeng
