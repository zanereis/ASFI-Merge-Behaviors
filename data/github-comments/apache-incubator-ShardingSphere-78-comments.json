We have made some progress in the configuration after discussion.\r\nThe new configuration in the plan is as follows.\r\n```yml\r\nspring:\r\n    shardingsphere:\r\n        orchestration:\r\n

'#Example:zookeeper,nacos,apollo'\r\n```\r\nThe old configuration is as follows.\r\n```yml\r\nspring:\r\n    shardingsphere:\r\n        orchestration:\r\n            name: ''\r\n            overwrite:

'#'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe hope that the new configuration can be compatible with the old configuration, but we want the configuration to be non redundant. There are some difficulties we get, can you give me some advice ?\r\n\r\n1. For compatibility with old configuration, ConfigCenter and LeafCenter must be optional. Can we use RegistryCenter to do the job of ConfigCenter or LeafCenter When user don't config ConfigCenter or LeafCenter ?\r\n\r\n2. There are `orchestration`'s child `name` in old configuration. Can we keep the `orchestration.name` and add `orchestration.registry.name` `orchestration.config.name` `orchestration.leaf.name` ?\r\n\r\nWe're very confused about this, Looking forward to your advice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/548364888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/548393908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3185#issuecomment-548393908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/3185","id":548393908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODM5MzkwOA==","user":{"login":"wgy8283335","id":22066046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDY2MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22066046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335","html_url":"https://github.com/wgy8283335","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgy8283335/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T14:11:06Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T14:11:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`overwrite`
