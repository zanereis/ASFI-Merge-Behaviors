Can we stay with one?\n\nYes, there is a reason for that – that is the way it is done in Lucene. As for sticking with one I am not sure. The one the Lucene developers came up with seems much more specialized than the one in the JDK, which is what our Support.PriorityQueue is a close match for.\n\nI noticed that there were modifications to the Util.PriorityQueue that were not in Lucene (namely adding a default constructor and functionality to make it growable). There were also major differences in the unit tests (I ported the original tests over, but left the extra ones in place). I was hoping this was the cause of the null reference exception in one of the tests in Misc, which I know can be fixed by simply making defensive coding against null, but I was hoping to uncover and fix the root cause. Unfortunately, the Util.PriorityQueue does not seem to be it. But it seems Connie has already resolved it on this branch.\n\nI also noticed that [Core.Search.TopTermsRewrite is referencing the wrong PriorityQueue](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Search/TopTermsRewrite.cs#L287). I have it corrected here on a local branch, but haven’t yet run tests on it to see what the total impact is (that particular class doesn’t have any unit tests). I suspect there are other places where the wrong PriorityQueue is being used, which could affect the stability of those pieces.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/259663964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/259670306","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/193#issuecomment-259670306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/193","id":259670306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTY3MDMwNg==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T11:46:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T11:49:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have now merged these changes to master.\n\nDo note that there is a new commit where the test class override stubs can be reverted (if needed): https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/commit/a209d7183138d3f2179b03113626ce5708f6e835\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/259670306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/259670890","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/193#issuecomment-259670890","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/193","id":259670890,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTY3MDg5MA==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-10T11:49:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T11:49:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oops, looks like the first attempt to push was rejected and I posted the wrong commit before.

To make this PR smaller, I was wondering if it would be a good idea to split my changes from NUnit 2 -> NUnit 3 into another PR? (dotnet-test-nunit uses NUnit3)\n\n@conniey, thanks for putting all of the effort into this.\n\nIt would be very helpful if you would outline what the plan is to get from this branch to building both .NET 4.5.1 and .NET Core for NuGet release. For the time being, lets not focus so much on the tools (such as TeamCity or which scripting language to use), but on the packaging and deployment requirements for NuGet.\n\nIn my mind it seems like it would be best to first get everything onto one branch (preferably master), since a build script that uses 2 different branches would be hard to maintain, and the remaining code changes we need to do for release will definitely be harder to maintain on multiple branches. Do you agree? If so, what needs to happen (if anything) to get this branch (and/or #194) ready to merge? If not, please provide some info.\n\nIs it going to be easier to put binaries for both .NET 4.5.1 and  .NET Core into the same NuGet package, or do we need separate packages? Will it be possible to put both the 32 and 64 bit binaries into the same NuGet package? I think we should aim for as few packages as possible (preferably a single NuGet package per project that contains binaries for all platforms and bitness), which is generally easier to maintain than separate packages.\n\nLet's assume that everyone who wants to use Lucene.Net on .NET Core will download it via NuGet. What needs to happen to get us to that point? Specifically, are there any special requirements necessary to get the icu-dotnet dependency into the target project? Is icu-dotnet ready to be deployed via NuGet now, or does something else need to be finished and/or automated first? Are there any known restrictions to the type of projects/platforms that it can be deployed into? Are there any additional special requirements that we need to take into consideration that vary from a \"normal\" .NET Core NuGet deployment?\n\nAre you interested in making a build script (or at least the start of one) to not just build and test both .NET frameworks, but also to package them up via NuGet, and perhaps make `install.ps1`/`uninstall.ps1` scripts for delivery (assuming we are going to put both 32 bit and 64 bit in the same package), or should we leave that task to Wyatt and/or me? A common approach that is compatible with any CI server is just to make a script that drops the build artifacts into a `.gitignore`d local directory. The CI server (whether it is TeamCity or MyGet) can then be configured to pick up the .nuget artifacts and put them into a MyGet feed. When we are satisfied that we have reached the appropriate release point, we can then manually push from MyGet to NuGet. From Wyatt's description, that is similar to the setup we have now, we just need the build script that is smart enough to do the packaging that can be plugged into the TeamCity setup.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/260197423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/260197786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/191#issuecomment-260197786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/191","id":260197786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDE5Nzc4Ng==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-13T16:54:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-13T16:54:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"BTW - your test suite status indicates that you haven't yet merged Lucene.Net.Grouping here.

It would be better to ship 1 package with a package structure like:\n\n```\nlib\\\n   net451\\\n     Lucene.Net.Core.dll (Built against .NET 4.5.1)\n   netstandard1.5\\\n     Lucene.Net.Core.dll (Built against .NET Standard 1.5)\n```\n\n>  If so, what needs to happen (if anything) to get this branch (and/or #194) ready to merge?\n\n #194 can be merged, as long as we are set-up to run NUnit 3 tests. \n\nFor this PR, the things to figure out are:\n- Which NuGet packaging option to use (listed below)\n- How to build in TeamCity\n- Double-check that all the tests pass. :)\n\n> Will it be possible to put both the 32 and 64 bit binaries into the same NuGet package?\n> Let's assume that everyone who wants to use Lucene.Net on .NET Core will download it via NuGet.

Is icu-dotnet ready to be deployed via NuGet now, or does something else need to be finished and/or automated first?\n\nBoth 32-bit and 64-bit native binaries are packaged into [`icu.net-54.04-alpha.nupkg`](https://www.myget.org/feed/icu-dotnet/package/nuget/icu.net).  Since Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common is a library, which native binary that gets built depends on the consuming project. If the project is managed using `project.json` (NuGet v3 and/or .NET CLI toolchain), then the system knows which native dependency (32bit, 64bit, windows or linux, etc) to restore based on the runtime that is being targeted in the [\"runtimes\": { } section](https://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/schema/project.json#runtimes).  Packages like [libuv](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Libuv/) use this so one package can work on multiple platforms.  Here's the issue (dotnet/cli#3233) that describes a user's similar problem with the solution.\n\nThe issue arises when someone is using `packages.config` (NuGet v2) to manage their project because the system only understands `content`.  Currently, `icu.net-54.04-alpha` package would drop all its contents into the packages directory, but it would be up to the user to add a link to those dlls. (I am working on updating that package's install/uninstall scripts to create a relative link to the 32-bit and 64-bit dlls in the project system so they are aware of it.)\n\nI am currently hosting the icu.net package on my myget-feed, so it can be consumed.  The [project](https://github.com/sillsdev/icu-dotnet) that this was forked from builds a minimal version of icu, which would not work for the Thai analyzers.\n\n> Are you interested in making a build script (or at least the start of one) to not just build and test both .NET frameworks.\n\nThat powershell snippet I have at the top can be used for both building, packaging and testing with a few modifications.  Is there an existing build script/steps I can look at?\n\n## Building NuGet Package\n\nThere are 2 options to build the NuGet package targeting .NET 4.5.1 and .NET Standard 1.5. \n1. Option 1: Use .NET CLI `project.json` tooling\n   \n   `project.json` is capable of multi-targeting ([How to Multitarget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tutorials/libraries#how-to-multitarget)).  In this PR, the .NET Core projects build for both .NET 4.5.1 and .NET Standard when you execute msbuild on either the `.xproj` or `dotnet build`.\n   \n   Steps to create .nupkg:\n   1. `msbuild Lucene.Net.Portable.sln`\n   2. For each project, execute `dotnet pack <directory with project.json>`\n2. Option 2: Build Lucene.Net.sln and Lucene.Net.Portable.sln\n   \n   Steps to create .nupkg:\n   1. msbuild Lucene.Net.sln (Visual Studio 2012)\n      - The reason for using VS2012 is because the restore order for NuGet packages in NuGet v3 (VS2015) is: project.json > {projectname}.project.json > packages.config > packages.{projectname}.config. So you get into issues like dotnet/corefx#4544 when trying to build a csproj that has a project.json in it.  There is a workaround using some hackery described in [this blog](http://stackify.com/using-both-xproj-and-csproj-with-net-core/).\n   2. msbuild Lucene.Net.Portable.sln (Visual Studio 2015)\n   3. Re-generate nuspec (in case new dependencies were added to any of the projects)\n   4. nuget pack <path to nuspec>\n\n**Option 1**\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Build a single solution | Requires VS2015 with Update 3 and .NET Core SDK |\n| NuGet package is taken care of by .NET CLI |  |\n\n**Option 2**\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| VS2012 users can continue working on desktop solution | Requires users who want to test both solutions to have VS2012 and VS2015 installed |\n|  | Have to generate nuspec for .nupkg |\n|  | Keep track of two solutions |\n\n> BTW - your test suite status indicates that you haven't yet merged Lucene.Net.Grouping here. It might be a good idea to ensure there are no issues with it in .NET core \n\nThanks for letting me know!

Basically, TeamCity both has built in tools that can run different plugged in processes AND it can also run external scripts. It is just a matter of adding the build steps in TeamCity to run the internal or external processes, which I am confident Wyatt or someone on his team is familiar with.\n\nThe only thing we need to deliver is a script that can be used to run each of the tasks (build/test/pack, etc), and the corresponding CLI command or commands to run them (and of course the links to any dependencies required on the server).\n\n>  Is there an existing build script/steps I can look at?\n\nSure, here are some examples\n\nhttps://github.com/maartenba/MvcSiteMapProvider/tree/master/build - This one has multi-targeting, and uses PowerShell/PSake for the build tasks. It may be a bit too complex for what we need, but it can be scaled down.\n\nhttps://github.com/NightOwl888/BoboBrowse.Net/tree/master/build - Here I took the same script and scaled it back for a project with fewer requirements.\n\nhttps://github.com/snikch/jquery.dirtyforms/blob/master/gulpfile.js - Here is an example in Gulp rather than PowerShell. Again, more complex than we need because it is used to update many Git subprojects, but can be scaled down easily. Here is its corresponding JSON file: https://github.com/snikch/jquery.dirtyforms/blob/master/package.json\n\n## PowerShell/PSake\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| Language you and I are both familiar with | Requires extra PSake (or similar) script to manage tasks |\n| Can run .NET functionality natively | Tasks run synchronously by default |\n| If we end up making a NuGet install.ps1 script, it will be the same language as the build script | Generally more code to maintain |\n\n## Gulp\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- |\n| JavaScript, so familiar syntax to lots of people | Requires plugins to work, and they may vary in quality |\n| Doesn't require an extra script to manage the tasks | Plugins are updated frequently - need to be sure that you specify the exact versions for plugins or the script may break (by default they upgrade automatically) |\n| Script runs asynchronous by default, so long running tasks can run parallel | Asynchronous by default sometimes makes it difficult to inline functionality |\n| Tasks can be managed from a JSON file |  |\n\nGulp has a nice CLI syntax that is straightforward\n\n```\ngulp <taskname>\n```\n\nor to run the default task configured in package.json\n\n```\ngulp\n```\n\n## Build Option\n\nIMO, the best option appears to be option 1. The fewer build tools it takes to get the job done is definitely going to be the simplest route. Not to mention, I would like to get my feet wet (or wetter?) with the newer tooling - it has been about a year since I last dealt with it.\n\nFrom the build script standpoint, it doesn't really matter too much as long as the build server can do it. The script itself can be broken into multiple tasks, each which has a separate CLI command to run and then tied together with a master script and/or the task steps in TeamCity. \n\nPerhaps Itamar can setup something like TravisCI, which can be configured on GitHub to run the unit tests when someone submits a PR..? Then we wouldn't have to worry so much if contributors have the right tooling to run the tests.\n\nIf you ask me, having TeamCity in the mix is a bit overkill for this process - MyGet is plenty capable of doing everything we need to build, deploy, and version the builds. But if you set it up so it works on MyGet (which interestingly doesn't require a command to push the NuGet packages to the feed), then it should be possible to use the same script on TeamCity.\n\nHere's an idea - why not make the script smart enough (at least for running tests) to detect if the right tools are installed and error out giving the appropriate info on what tool is required (and perhaps the URL where to get it). Also, perhaps it could list a command or commands that are possible with the current tooling to run the tests on one framework or another.

At the very least, this will create a lot of merge conflicts for #191 and an unneeded NuGet package to be created and then abandoned shortly afterward. Not to mention, naming the package `Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common.ICU` is a poor naming choice, since there is another package `Lucene.Net.Analysis.ICU`, which will cause lots of confusion if/when it is ported. We are getting very close to the point where #191 can be merged - we are probably just a few days away from that point, after which we will be able to get the pre-release on NuGet in short order.\r\n\r\nThat said, it might pay off if some interested parties take a look at her [demo](https://github.com/conniey/lucenenet-demo) and create prototypes to verify icu-dotnet works for all environments. That is what will happen anyway when we get the pre-release on NuGet, but we might be able to head off any remaining issues earlier with earlier feedback.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, if anyone needs an immediate solution to this, they should choose one of the following options:\r\n\r\n1. [Manually build and pack #191](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/191#issue-186402248) (recommended)\r\n2. Manually build this branch (will require some extra work to pack if you need NuGet packages)\r\n3. Use the [MyGet packages](https://www.myget.org/gallery/lucene-net) and delete the ICU DLLs (assuming you don't need Thai support or to utilize the SegmentingTokenizerBase). This is not guaranteed to work, but has worked in at least one case.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/262569964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/262581329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/191#issuecomment-262581329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/191","id":262581329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjU4MTMyOQ==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-23T17:32:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T17:32:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Prescott,\n\nThanks.

For Spatial4n, I was unable to get a portable library to work as far back as .NET 3.5, so having a .csproj around for the old stack might be the only solution.\r\n\r\nYou can create projects targeting .NET 3.5 using .NET Core projects (.xproj).  Here's an example project.json that'll do it below. And if you want to multi-target your library, just add another framework in the frameworks section.  The benefit of using .NET Core projects rather than Portable libraries is that Portable libraries only allows you to use the intersection of APIs from different frameworks so that it can compile it into a single binary.  Whereas .NET Core projects, compiles the code multiple times, generating a different binary for each framework you have in the framework section.  So, you're not limited to the intersection of all your frameworks APIs.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0-*\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n  },\r\n  \"frameworks\": {\r\n    \"net35\": {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n> Ahh, that is something I didn't try before (it says above it won't work with VS2015).

Yes, opening Lucene.Net.sln from this PR will not work in Visual Studio 2015.  I had mentioned that issue before (see quotation below).  If you want, I can add in that workaround described in the [blog](http://stackify.com/using-both-xproj-and-csproj-with-net-core/) so Lucene.Net.sln will open in Visual Studio 2015.  I was hoping that long term, we wouldn't have to keep the csproj files around though because the xproj does everything the existing solution did and more.  What do you think?\r\n\r\n> The reason for using VS2012 is because the restore order for NuGet packages in NuGet v3 (VS2015) is: project.json > {projectname}.project.json > packages.config > packages.{projectname}.config. So you get into issues like dotnet/corefx#4544 when trying to build a csproj that has a project.json in it. There is a workaround using some hackery described in this [blog](http://stackify.com/using-both-xproj-and-csproj-with-net-core/).\r\n\r\n> Here's the file...  restore.zip.\r\n\r\nWow, your restore.dg is missing a lot of project references.  It only has Lucene.Net.Tests.Analysis.Common as a project to restore.  I've read a bunch of bugs where the .NET Core VS tooling doesn't behave the same way as the command line tools.

It uses classes, which since 4.8 don't exist anymore (e.g. TermEnum) and needs MemoryIndex to be ported to full .NET. Shall I wait till porting 4.8 version to .NET Framework is complete?\r\n\r\n@Metamorphus \r\n\r\nI am not sure I understand your question exactly, but since this is a port of version 4.8.0 we should port all of it from [lucene-solr 4.8.0](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0) (or no later than 4.8.1) to be compatible. As great as it would be to be able to get the features of Lucene 6.x, it is not very likely we will be able to make the pieces fit if we try that. \r\n\r\nOnce we reach the 4.8.0 milestone and have a stable release, my hope is that work can begin on [upgrading it to a more recent version of Lucene](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/174#issuecomment-251614795), rather than doing another port from scratch (which for 4.8.0 has taken 2 years to get to its current state of 95% of the way to release, and is the reason why Lucene.Net is now lagging so far behind Lucene). For now, 4.8.0 is shiny and new in the .Net world, and is a huge improvement over Lucene.Net 3.0.3. Your contribution of Highlighter will make the 4.8.0 release a reality sooner.\r\n\r\nLucene 4.8.0 Highlighter is available here: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucene/highlighter. To make things easier, you may wish to clone the [lucene-solr repo](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/) to your local machine and then use\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout tags/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nto view the Java code at the 4.8.0 release.\r\n\r\nThen, you can clone the https://github.com/apache/lucenenet repository (if you have not already done so), make a branch to work on (`git checkout -b highlighter`), add 2 projects to the solution named  `Lucene.Net.Highlighter` and `Lucene.Net.Tests.Highlighter`, and begin porting. Note that we are keeping similar namespace names despite the fact that they may differ from project names that they reside in.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have much knowledge of Java, but be prepared to do a Google search for every piece that you are unsure about (something like `java HashMap equivalent c#`). If you can't get an answer on Google, try to find another piece of code in lucene-solr that references the same type and see how the conversion was handled in Lucene.Net.  It is usually simpler to do this up front than to put something in that you are totally unsure of and then have to work out why the tests are failing later, but also note that you won't be able to be 100% sure it is right until the tests are passing (and even then there may still be some doubt). \r\n\r\n> Heads up - be aware that the Substring overload with 2 parameters in Java works differently than .NET (it should be translated from `Substring(start, end)` to `Substring(start, end - start)`).\r\n\r\nAnyway, once you are comparing the same version between Lucene and Lucene.Net, things should go smoother. The `MemoryIndex` class is in the `Lucene.Net.Memory` project. To my knowledge, there is no `TermEnum` type, but there is one named `TermsEnum` in the `Lucene.Net` (core) project in the `Lucene.Net.Index` namespace, which is used by 4 types in Highlighter 4.8.0.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need further assistance, and do be sure to also confirm whether you will be porting Highlighter so we don't have any duplicate efforts or lags because we are waiting for something that isn't being worked on. Also, you should probably join the [dev mailing list](https://lucenenet.apache.org/community.html) and continue this conversation there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/262852490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/262934834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/174#issuecomment-262934834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/174","id":262934834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjkzNDgzNA==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T11:12:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T21:52:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Spatial is now complete.\r\n\r\nThe `Spatial4n.Core` and `Spatial4n.Core.NTS` dependent NuGet packages are currently on this MyGet feed: https://www.myget.org/F/spatial4n/api/v2\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/262934834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/262942103","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/191#issuecomment-262942103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/191","id":262942103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Mjk0MjEwMw==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-25T12:00:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-25T12:00:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@conniey \r\n\r\nFYI - I have completed Lucene.Net.Spatial and it has been added to the master branch.

I'll get my first touch to it at weekend, but I anticipate a lot of problems, since I'm only a junior developer (e.g. I'm not even familiar with NUnit). That's why don't count on me for now. I'll give the final answer next week.\r\n\r\nRight now, however, I'm facing another problem. I use basic Lucene operations (add document and search by query) in my project and it works well, when I run the project via `dotnet run`, but when i publish the project and run its dll, I get this error:\r\n\r\n`fail: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel[13]\r\n      Connection id \"0HL0L6Q75SUEF\": An unhandled exception was thrown by the application.\r\nSystem.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'Lucene.Net.Util.Constants' threw an exception. ---> System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.Configuration' threw an exception. ---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.KeyValueParser.AddToDictionary(XElement element, Stack1 context, SortedDictionary2 results)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.KeyValueParser.ParseElement(XElement element, Stack1 context, SortedDictionary2 results)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.KeyValueParser.ParseElement(XElement element, Stack1 context, SortedDictionary2 results)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.KeyValueParser.ParseElement(XElement element, Stack1 context, SortedDictionary2 results)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.ConfigFileConfigurationProvider.ParseElement(XElement element, Stack1 context, SortedDictionary2 results)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.ConfigFileConfigurationProvider.Load()\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigurationRoot..ctor(IList1 providers)\r\n   at Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigurationBuilder.Build()\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.Configuration..cctor()\r\n   --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.Configuration.Configuration.GetAppSetting(String key)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Support.AppSettings.Get(String key, String defValue)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Util.Constants..cctor()\r\n   --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Index.DocumentsWriterPerThread..ctor(String segmentName, Directory directory, LiveIndexWriterConfig indexWriterConfig, InfoStream infoStream, DocumentsWriterDeleteQueue deleteQueue, Builder fieldInfos)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Index.DocumentsWriter.EnsureInitialized(ThreadState state)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Index.DocumentsWriter.UpdateDocument(IEnumerable1 doc, Analyzer analyzer, Term delTerm)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.UpdateDocument(Term term, IEnumerable1 doc, Analyzer analyzer)\r\n   at Lucene.Net.Index.IndexWriter.AddDocument(IEnumerable1 doc, Analyzer analyzer)\r\n   at CCC.Repositories.GenericModelRepository1.Add(T item, String username) in C:\\Projects\\CCC\\src\\Repositories\\GenericModelRepository.cs:line 85\r\n   at CCC.Controllers.ApiController1.Post(T entity) in C:\\Projects\\CCC\\src\\Controllers\\ApiController.cs:line 75\r\n   at CCC.Controllers.BlogsApiController.Post(Blog item) in C:\\Projects\\CCC\\src\\Controllers\\BlogApiController.cs:line 35\r\n   at lambda_method(Closure , Object , Object[] )`\r\n\r\nMe and my team were struggling with this the whole afternoon, and then we found this code fragment in Lucene.Net.Core\\Support\\Configuration\\Configuration.cs file:\r\n\r\n`var entryAssembly = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly();`\r\n `var configurationFiles = new string[0];`\r\n\r\n `if (entryAssembly != null)`\r\n `{`\r\n       `var directory = Path.GetDirectoryName(entryAssembly.Location);`\r\n      ` configurationFiles = Directory.GetFiles(directory, \"*.config\");`\r\n `}`\r\n\r\nSo basically, it looks at the directory, where application assembly is located, and grabs our web.config file, and treats it as its own configuration file. Is this correct behavior? \r\nThis is definitely the reason of the problem, since bin folder, where built assembly is located, contains no *.config files, and running the project via `dotnet run` works well. But published application needs web.config file to launch web-server.

I opened a pull request for Collation (a small namespace in Analysis.Common): https://github.com/conniey/lucenenet/pull/25. Not sure if you didn't mention it because it is not critical to getting this branch merged or if you were unaware of this task. Note there are still 4 failing tests and I suspect there may need to be updates to icu-dotnet in order to fix them.\r\n2. Typically when I make a build script I include a way to set the version number from the CLI so the binaries can be built and NuGet packaged without having to manually update the version number in several locations. This is helpful if, for example, you need to be able to create packages outside of the normal CI process (for example, it might take some of the pressure off if we could make a build from this branch and upload it manually). It also opens the door if you need to any customizations other than the typical \"patch AssemblyInfo.cs\" that is available in CI environments (such as setting the copyright year to the current year).

Then, start coming up with a plan to create a higher level APIs to cover the most common use cases (similar to the way [SimpleLucene](https://simplelucene.codeplex.com/documentation) did but with a broader scope). Ultimately, we should probably create high-level integration packages for various frameworks (ASP.NET, MVC, WebApi, WPF, etc) so everyone that uses Lucene.Net doesn't have to rewrite the same boring configuration code and so Lucene.Net can be configured using the standards in those frameworks (such as with DI and via extension methods). And of course, these high-level APIs should ideally be setup so they don't need to change (additions only) when the next version of Lucene is ported.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/266240033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/266468622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/191#issuecomment-266468622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/191","id":266468622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjQ2ODYyMg==","user":{"login":"conniey","id":10136526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10136526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey","html_url":"https://github.com/conniey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-12T15:59:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T15:59:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@NightOwl888 : Hey.

Still have 7 that are failing. I am trying to identify all of the issues, so this list may not be complete, but this is what I have found so far.\r\n\r\nicu-dotnet Issues\r\n----\r\n1. Sentence breaking not working when first word of sentence is lower case. In Java, both of the following return the same results (the latter):\r\n\r\n```\r\n?Icu.BreakIterator.GetBoundaries(Icu.BreakIterator.UBreakIteratorType.SENTENCE, new Icu.Locale(\"en-US\"), \"test this is.  another sentence this test has.  far away is that planet.\")\r\nCount = 1\r\n    [0]: {Start: [0], End: [72]}\r\n?Icu.BreakIterator.GetBoundaries(Icu.BreakIterator.UBreakIteratorType.SENTENCE, new Icu.Locale(\"en-US\"), \"Test this is.  Another sentence this test has.  Far away is that planet.\")\r\nCount = 3\r\n    [0]: {Start: [0], End: [15]}\r\n    [1]: {Start: [15], End: [48]}\r\n    [2]: {Start: [48], End: [72]}\r\n```\r\n2. Sentence incorrectly breaking when there is a `\\n` in the string. In this string: `\"any application that requires\\nfull-text search, especially cross-platform. \\nApache Lucene is an open source project available for free download.\"` we are expecting the first sentence to end at 76, but getting 30.\r\n3. Word breaking is happening on hyphenated words instead of treating them as a single word, for example, \"high-performance\" should be considered a single word, not 2 words.\r\n\r\n4. The ThaiWordBreaker class was added to work-around another BreakIterator difference from Java - namely that in Java Thai characters were broken into separate \"words\" if adjacent to non-Thai characters. For example \"สวัสดีkrap\", should break to \"สวัสดี\" and \"krap\". Ideally, icu-dotnet would handle this, but this solution is acceptable if that is unreasonable to do.\r\n5. If we are keeping the ThaiWordBreaker, I just ran the tests dealing with Thai numerals, and my assumption that those should be broken just like Thai characters was incorrect. So, the [these lines](https://github.com/conniey/lucenenet/blob/08453c16290465842866affa6f2fdd35517608b6/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Th/ThaiTokenizer.cs#L235-L236) should be changed to:\r\n```\r\nisThai = char.IsLetter(c) && thaiPattern.IsMatch(c.ToString());\r\nisNonThai = char.IsLetter(c) && !isThai;\r\n```\r\nYou may wish to also change the variable names to `isThaiLetter`, `isNonThaiLetter`, etc. to make this more clear in the code. You can use the following test to verify the results.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Test, LuceneNetSpecific]\r\npublic void TestNumeralBreaking() \r\n{\r\n\t  ThaiAnalyzer analyzer = new ThaiAnalyzer(TEST_VERSION_CURRENT, CharArraySet.EMPTY_SET);\r\n\t  AssertAnalyzesTo(analyzer, \"๑๒๓456\", new String[] { \"๑๒๓456\" });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBreakIterator Dependencies\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems like an easier path to setup the BreakIterator similar to the way it was in Java (as an abstract class), since it is being passed as method and constructor parameters and because it is meant to be an extension point where you can design your own word breaking if you need to customize the default ICU behavior. So, I ported the abstract `BreakIterator` class and have created a concrete `IcuBreakIterator` to wrap the icu-dotnet \"BreakIterator\" static functions (with the ability to pass locale and \"type\" to the constructor). I am still working on creating tests to verify the behavior against Java. Basically, the same \"iterator\" logic that exists in Java to move forward, backward, or arbitrarily through the break points is in this class.\r\n\r\nHowever, since this class depends directly on icu-dotnet, we can't just put it into our Support namespace without adding an icu-dotnet dependency to Lucene.Net.Core. And since other parts of Lucene (SimpleCN, ICU, Analysis.Common, etc) depend on BreakIterator functionality, it would be simpler to share this behavior if it were part of a common library. \r\n\r\nWhile we could build our own, it would be an extra dependency that doesn't exist in Lucene. Ideally, it should go in icu-dotnet (since in Java it was part of the JDK, which icu-dotnet is emulating). If this functionality were in icu-dotnet, it would not just benefit the Lucene.Net project, but could potentially make other projects easier to port from Java.

In hindsight, this change may not have been necessary.\r\n- [CharacterIterator](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration-highlighter/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Support/CharacterIterator.cs) - a GetTextAsString() method was added primarily so we can get the text to pass on to icu-dotnet, and the documentation hasn't yet been migrated from Java.\r\n- [StringCharacterIterator](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration-highlighter/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Support/StringCharacterIterator.cs) - Exactly like Java (but documentation not yet migrated).\r\n- [IcuBreakIterator](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration-highlighter/src/Lucene.Net.Highlighter/IcuBreakIterator.cs) - If you remove the hacks I put in to emulate the RuleBasedBreakIterator, it would probably be a useful addition to icu-dotnet.\r\n- [TestBreakIterator](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration-highlighter/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.Highlighter/TestBreakIterator.cs) - A partial set of tests that verify the sentence and word breaking RuleBasedBreakIterator rules.\r\n\r\nNote that CharacterIterator is a dependency of [CharArrayIterator](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration-highlighter/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Util/CharArrayIterator.cs), but since that is in Analysis.Common (which already depends on icu-dotnet), we can completely remove all of these classes from Lucene.Net once the functionality is available in icu-dotnet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/266878654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/267138927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/194#issuecomment-267138927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/194","id":267138927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzEzODkyNw==","user":{"login":"synhershko","id":212252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko","html_url":"https://github.com/synhershko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/synhershko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-14T19:56:42Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T19:56:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

It still isn't quite perfect but it is getting there. Currently I am using build.ps1 to build things. I am still working on getting the tests to run successfully. It can easily be made to accept the current versioning once we unify the codebase.\r\n\r\nThe individual project builds and tests are at @synhershko 's request. Mechanically, the [Lucene.net.core](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=LuceneNet_Core)  build is the real build and test with the [nightly](https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=LuceneNet_LuceneNetNightly) generating the myget packages.

They changed the way that they ingested Native library dependencies and split it into a different repository that I have to merge to and take into account.\r\n* Fix assembly loading changes in .NET Core\r\n  * Recently, icu-dotnet introduced a new way of loading assemblies that uses native Windows/Linux API calls rather than using a [DllImport] from C#.  Since we implemented a new way to load native libraries in .NET Core (via /runtimes/{RID}/ rather than adding to the Environment.Path), it breaks loading in .NET Core.  I need to research how to get the native library runtime paths in .NET Core.  Then figure out how to load it first when they are using the Windows/Linux APIs\r\n* Modify [BreakIteratorRules.java](http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/text/resources/BreakIteratorRules.java.html) to consumable rules for icu-dotnet\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/279609348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/282604682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/203#issuecomment-282604682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/203","id":282604682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjYwNDY4Mg==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-27T01:02:18Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T01:02:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@conniey \r\n\r\nI also apologize for the delayed response.\r\n\r\n> Is there anything I can help with?\r\n\r\nYes, there is. I have been working on cleaning the API up and making it more .NET-like.\r\n\r\n### CLS Compliance\r\n\r\nPart of this process is making the whole project CLS compliant, so it can be consumed by VB and other .NET languages.\r\n\r\n1. Currently, there are only 8 remaining CLS-related warnings that need to be addressed. But before we fix them, it would be nice if we could ensure that the fixes don't cause any negative effects - in other words, we need as many tests fixed as possible (namely in Lucene.Net.Core). If you could help with the debugging efforts, that would be great.\r\n2. In addition, there was a bit of a snag with icu-dotnet because *it* is not marked CLS Compliant. Therefore, by default none of its types are CLS Compliant and cannot be exposed publicly in Lucene.Net (including Enum types). I would appreciate it if you mark the assembly with the CLSCompliant attribute.  \r\n\r\nI reverted the ThaiAnalyzer back to its previous state and adapted the ICUBreakIterator to work with it - seems to work pretty well, for now (and it is now CLS Compliant). Let me know if/when you have a rule-based break iterator so I can ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Collation\r\n\r\nAlso, I ended up marking the Collation-related types CLSCompliant(false). I am now pretty much convinced that there is no way we can get them working with icu-dotnet, based on [this documentation](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucene/analysis/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/collation/CollationAttributeFactory.java#L65-L68). It also seems to indicate that the collation functionality in the Analysis.ICU package is better (and it is based on ICU 4J, so it should work). Anyway, my thought is to add `FEATURE_COLLATION` as an option and leave it out of the compile, since it is pretty much useless unless we port over a large part of the JDK to make it work. So, ignore those failing tests for the time being.\r\n\r\n### Test Framework\r\n\r\nI also reverted the changes to OLD_FORMAT_IMPERSONATION_IS_ACTIVE and made it static again. There really doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to ensure this flag is read from everywhere if it is non-static. This fixed more than a dozen failing tests. I am working on finishing up the Codec functionality now - specifically the randomizing of codecs and the IgnoreCodecs functionality.\r\n\r\nBut, I could use some help. The test framework has been a major source of test failures. Many parts of it were not translated correctly or are still unfinished. IMO, the test framework should be reviewed line-by-line to ensure that the equivalent functionality is implemented.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Comments\r\n\r\nAlso, as I [mentioned above](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/203#issue-203023160), some of the documentation comments need to be finished. Mostly, they are malformed so they don't show up in Visual Studio, but there is also some documentation that is either incorrect or has not been brought over from Lucene.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/282604682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/289209786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/204#issuecomment-289209786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/204","id":289209786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTIwOTc4Ng==","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-25T12:50:13Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T12:50:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool - certainly will be better than sending files one by one :).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/289209786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/624212358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/279#issuecomment-624212358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/279","id":624212358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDIxMjM1OA==","user":{"login":"clambertus","id":8631661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzE2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8631661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus","html_url":"https://github.com/clambertus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clambertus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-23T23:49:46Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T17:57:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<p>We should probably look into doing this.

In any case, this is a major API change that should be looked at before the 4.8.0 release.</p>\n<i>by nightowl888</i>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/624212358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/comments/296527126","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/203#issuecomment-296527126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/203","id":296527126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjUyNzEyNg==","user":{"login":"davhdavh","id":1201165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDExNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1201165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh","html_url":"https://github.com/davhdavh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davhdavh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-24T05:22:21Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T05:22:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When do you expect the merge to happen?
