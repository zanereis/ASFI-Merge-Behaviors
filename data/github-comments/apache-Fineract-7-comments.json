suggest that we ignore the entire Flyway related discussion (above, in previous inline review discussions), I think I actually got it work in the end now, but all that was more of a \"distraction\" re. the main point of this effort (the Gradle upgrade) - because we (probably) will just remove Flyway from Gradle anyway, see #613.\r\n\r\nBut what we do still need to do here is to get `./gradlew integrationTest`to pass on this branch/PR - it currently does not, because Tocmcat does not fully start (it starts but seems to ignore Fineract WAR completely), see `build/reports/tests/integrationTest/classes/org.apache.fineract.integrationtests.AccountNumberPreferencesTest.html`.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is that `./gradlew tomcatRunWAR` does work though!

(I've updated the title to more accurately reflect this.)\r\n\r\nThis use blocks #607, which blocks #601, which would help to clean up with seems to be a classpath mess.\r\n\r\nSo I'm proposing that we simplify things by removing our dependency on BVal, understanding that we loose a (minor?) convenience (?) use of `@NotEmpty` annotation. I doubt that was actually ever intended to be available at all - it's, likely, more of a side effect of the (wrong) use of `openjpa-all` (which is a \"shaded\" JAR which contains far to much). \r\n\r\nI'm also not entirely sure if this  `@NotEmpty` annotation check even actually worked? At least [the OpenJPA documentation makes no mention of Apache BVal, or even any annotation based validation](http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.4.3/apache-openjpa/docs/manual.html).\r\n\r\nLong story short, I'm suggesting this (very minor) change despite it (possibly, not even sure) causing a minor regression in checking for (unlikely?) empty fields in one particular request.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to add a real integration test for `@NotEmpty`, and if that currently works, add an explicit dependency to BVal, or some other artifact JAR with these validation annotations. To me, both seem unnecessary, and avoiding it will likely reduce other dependency issues (in #601 I'd like to try to clean up what, to me, currently seems to be a bit of a mess in terms of Fineracts depenencies).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509102619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509104653","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/615#issuecomment-509104653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/615","id":509104653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTEwNDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-08T07:02:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T07:02:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@awasum @mohitsinha re. giving more details about test failures on Travis CI, you may be be interested in reading the comments and linked issues re. the back and forth for `./gradlew test` with and without `--info` [at the end of .travis.yml](https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/.travis.yml) ...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509104653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509105476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/606#issuecomment-509105476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/606","id":509105476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTEwNTQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-08T07:05:12Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T07:06:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Oh and BTW I just stumbled upon this in `fineract-provider/build.gradle` :\r\n\r\n    exclude module: 'bval-core'\r\n    exclude module: 'org.apache.bval.bundle'\r\n    exclude module: 'bval-jsr303'\r\n\r\nSo in the past someone actually tried to actively prevent the use of Apache BVal at some point - but because of `openjpa-all`, it sneaked (back?) in;

Are you referring to the *`:enhance`* issue? Or the *`:metamodel`* issue? Apologies for the confusion between the two. \r\n\r\nThe *`:enhance`* issue that I referred to [*here*](https://github.com/vorburger/fineract/pull/1#issuecomment-509453457) and the *`:metamodel`* issue that I referred to [*here*](https://github.com/radcortez/openjpa-gradle-plugin/issues/8#issue-464995001), are separate issues — *though on the same plugin* — discovered under separate scenarios. It is very likely, I suspect, that the two issues are related somehow.\r\n\r\nI discovered the *`:enhance`* issue immediately after I cloned the fineract project. The very first thing I did as a sanity check, was run *`gradle check`* on the project. That failed, [*producing this stack trace*](http://bit.ly/RadCrtzNhnc). However, I proceeded with [*my`api/implementation` changes*](http://bit.ly/FinerPR1) regardless, by working around that. I simply excluded the problematic task with *`gradle -x :enhance ...`* whenever I needed to build the project.\r\n\r\nAfter I was finished, I was still curious why the *`:enhance`* task had failed. So I investigated by creating a simple, stripped-down standalone project that only applied the *`com.radcortez.gradle:openjpa-gradle-plugin:3.0.0`*. That simple project did not include any of the other dependencies that fineract has. \r\n\r\nIt was under that scenario that I discovered the radcortez plugin's *`:metamodel`* issue.  [*Here's the stack trace I encountered*](https://github.com/radcortez/openjpa-gradle-plugin/files/3368461/openjpa-gradle-plugin.issue.8.a.txt) in that scenario. \r\n\r\nIt's possible that the reason you have not encountered [*the `:metamodel` issue*](http://bit.ly/RadCrtz8) in the fineract project, might be because [*the `:metamodel` task/extension*](http://bit.ly/RadCrtzMeta) must be explicitly ran/configured in order to reproduce [*the issue I reported*](http://bit.ly/RadCrtz8). Whereas, the *`:enhance`* task is automatically ran as part of any Gradle build that includes Gradle's built-in *`classes`* task; such as the *`gradle :check`* task.\r\n\r\nOr is it possible that some admixture of all of the dozens of different dependencies in the fineract project affects the behavior of the radcortez plugin? Could it be that some combination of direct dependencies and transitive dependencies in fineract are masking or eliminating the radcortez plugin issue for you? Or maybe I'm only seeing issues on my machine because of development environment-related differences? Like OS or whatever? I'm on Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509612834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509706132","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/607#issuecomment-509706132","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/607","id":509706132,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTcwNjEzMg==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T16:08:23Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T16:08:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Made further progress re. this, let's see if all intergration tests on Travis CI pass now...\r\n\r\n```\r\n342 tests completed, 1 failed, 13 skipped\r\n:integrationTest FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\nis actually not too bad... it's unclear on Travis which (single) one it is.

With the latest additional commit just pushed to this PR now, it is starting to look much better for me locally - now let's see if all ITs pass on Travis CI with the upgraded Gradle!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509789723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/509791385","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/614#issuecomment-509791385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/614","id":509791385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwOTc5MTM4NQ==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-09T20:17:22Z","updated_at":"2019-07-09T20:17:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@awasum @Anh3h this LGTM now, and I have no more objections.

But that just hides what IMHO is still a real problem in GitPod though (https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/648) - any project that needs a Gradle version that is not compatible with the one you packaged won't properly work. Gradle in practice is not  backwards compatible over major versions. \r\n\r\nHope this helps and clarifies?
