First is that what you have built here is incredibly awesome and powerful! I think FilterCSVColumns is the wrong name for this Processor - it should be perhaps TransformCSV, as leveraging Calcite allows us to do some pretty powerful queries, such as \"SELECT \\* FROM CSV.A WHERE AMOUNT2 < 99\" and I imagine that this type of use case will be very common.\n\nI do have a concern, though, which is that if you attempt to perform a JOIN operation, for example \"SELECT X.AMOUNT2, X.AMOUNT3 FROM CSV.A as X JOIN CSV.A AS Y ON X.AMOUNT2=Y.AMOUNT2\" we end up with an IOException: Stream closed. This is because Calcite will have to read the data multiple times in order to perform the JOIN. I think we can get around this by changing the CsvSchemaFactory2 to be something like CsvInputStreamFactory, and that class, rather than receiving the InputStream directly would be passed the FlowFIle and ProcessSession and could create the InputStream on-demand. This would allow the data to be read multiple times by creating two InputStream's. The nice thing is that if this runs on a system with sufficient RAM the Operating System's disk cache will generally mean that we don't even have to read the data for the second pass unless it's a really massive amount of CSV.\n\nAdditionally, I think we need to have some sort of validator for the SQL Select Statement property, as right now if the query is invalid, the processor is valid and just routes everything to failure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218531630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218543143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/420#issuecomment-218543143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/420","id":218543143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODU0MzE0Mw==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T18:12:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T18:12:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ToivoAdams as I think even more about this, it's opening up a lot of awesome possibilities.

The system.out calls are _only_ coming from one test class (3 test cases) and I kept them there for a reason, primarily to help with review process where values can be visualized by the reviewer.

This is definitely something people had asked for. \nNow, . . . . I see that you added it to the standard processors. What I would suggest is to make it a separate bundle in 'nifi-nar-bundles'. Basically we are at the point where we are trying to be cognizant of a NiFi size and do not put anything new into standard processors. So it has to be a separate bundle. And while we are in the early stages of Extension Registry discussion, having separate bundles, would still (even today) allow anyone to add/remove what they don't want in NiFI while with the current approach you've taken it won't be easy to do. \nLet us know if you need more guidance, but I would also suggest to look into any bundle in 'nifi-nar-bundles' as an example.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/219501349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/219502908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/404#issuecomment-219502908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/404","id":219502908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTUwMjkwOA==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T18:19:34Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T18:19:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 there is a merge conflict in \n\n```\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in nifi-mock/src/test/java/org/apache/nifi/util/TestStandardProcessorTestRunner.java\n```\n\nCould you please take care of it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/219502908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/219503574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/416#issuecomment-219503574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/416","id":219503574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTUwMzU3NA==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-16T18:21:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T18:21:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@olegz i am not aware of any discussion or decision to avoid adding things to standard processors.

During that release would we would also need to update this custom UI appropriately.\n\nGoing forward, we should establish APIs/components/widgets for custom UIs to consume with guarantees around their APIs. However, we need to be mindful that when we do this we won't be able to freely break those APIs.

So for the example scenarios...\n- You could do this two different ways, but one would be to create a new Group instance with name \"Admins\" and no users and call addGroup(), then create a new User instance with name \"Bryan Bende\" and a set of group ids containing the id of the \"Admins\" group and call addUser()\n-  Same as above to create the group and user and place the user in the group... then you would retrieve the User instance for \"Andrew LoPresto\", make a copy of that User instance with the name set to \"Andy LoPrestro\" and call updateUser(...)\n- Same as scenario 1 to create the group and users and place the users in the group, although to add both users to the group in one action you could retrieve the Group, make a copy of the Group and add both user ids to the set of users, and call updateGroup(). Removing \"Bryan Bende\" from \"Admins\" could be done by copying the Group without \"Bryan Bende\"s id in the set of users and calling updateGroup, or by copying the User for \"Bryan Bende\" without the id of the \"Admin\" group in the set of groups and calling updateUser().\n\nAfter thinking about all of these, it seems like it would nice to have builders that made it convenient for updating a User or Group... So something like...\n\n```\nUser user = authorizer.getUser(id);\nUser updatedUser = new User.UserBuilder().fromUser(user).name(\"New Name\").build();\nauthorizer.updateUser(updatedUser);\n```\n\nAlso easily removing entries, so something like this for removing a user from a group:\n\n```\nUser user = authorizer.getUser(id);\nUser updatedUser = new User.UserBuilder().fromUser(user).removeGroup(groupId).build();\nauthorizer.updateUser(updatedUser);\n```\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220121052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220124482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/256#issuecomment-220124482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/256","id":220124482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDEyNDQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T18:57:08Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T18:57:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Edgardo Vega  on dev@nifi.apache.org replies:\nIsn't the concern about the webhook url handled by the fact there is nifi\nsecurity.

It is simple Java implementation of SSH2, allowing anyone to build components that need to interact over SSH. So _\"processors here are still using SFTP under the covers\"_ is not really accurate? What I think is more accurate is that both processors utilize the same library (JSch) to accomplish the set goal.  \nNow, I am not saying there are no issues with @eorgad's  code, configuration, documentation etc. I have not personally had a chance to look through it yet, and I am sure there are things that may be incorrect or things that could be improved.

I suppose I am more familiar with, and conditioned to assume, the models used in many database-backed frameworks where the user and group models are canonical -- while there may be many `User` objects instantiated that describe \"Andy LoPresto\", they all refer to the same record in persistent storage, and modifying one (and saving it) updates the record that all point to. In addition, it would not be necessary to clone a retrieved record in order to modify it. \n\nExample (using Rails/Grails-esque syntax, but easily replaceable with `authorizer.getUser(id)` ): \n\n```\nUser andy = User.getByUsername(\"alopresto\")\nlogger.info(andy.getFirstName()) // \"Andrew\"\nandy.setFirstName(\"Andy\")\nandy.update()\n```\n\nIn addition, while updating the relationship can be done from either end (i.e. adding a user to _n_ groups is easier by modifying the one user instead of retrieving and modifying _n_ groups, while removing all users from a specific group would use the opposite operation), it seems like the model proposed above duplicates a lot of data during each operation. Is there a reason for this? It seems likely there is a tradeoff I am missing. \n\nI also have questions about resolving uniqueness constraints, ID mutability, locks, merge conflicts, etc. on updates, but it seems that these details are delegated to the `authorizer` implementation?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220227038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220307255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/452#issuecomment-220307255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/452","id":220307255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDMwNzI1NQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T12:17:46Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T12:17:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto Thanks for the very thorough review! This API is designed strictly for handling the persistence of access policies which would also include Users and Groups. These objects are designed as simple data objects or POJOs. While the MutableAuthorizer can load these records, it must be told when to save. It wouldn't know a given User/Group/Policy has been modified. This is part of the motivation to have the objects be immutable. The intent is very clear to an implementor of MutableAuthorizer that the objects won't be modified outside of their knowing. I believe that @bbende recommendation of introducing a Builder for creating new versions of a given User/Group/Policy is a great way to handle the cloning.\n\nThe end goal here was to design the API such that the implementation only needed to be concerned with persistence.\n\n**uniqueness constraint** - How we address this would ultimately be based on whether we support reloading the Users/Groups/Policies while the application is running. We decided against this as the motivation for the MutableAuthorizer API was to support an Authorizer that was managed by NiFi. With this approach we would be enforcing uniqueness at startup and when new records were added outside of the MutableAuthorizer.\n\n**ID mutability** - The identifier of a record is not mutable. The identity of a user and name of a group are (using the clone/builder approach described). This is to more easily support name chanes or typos without having to re-create all the policies for that entity as well.\n\n**locks & merge conflicts** - Thread locking is handled by the web tier using the same mechanism as the other Resources. For 1.0.0 we are introducing fine grain locking through a RevisionManager. Obtaining a write lock for a given record would require a client to include a Revision. The RevisionManager manager would validate the Revision and lock the Revision to prevent other clients from modifying the same record.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220307255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220330762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/454#issuecomment-220330762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/454","id":220330762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDMzMDc2Mg==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T13:53:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T14:07:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 When canceling revision claims for Connectable components in the verifyXxx() methods, DAO access will not return null so you do not need to check for it there.

If the authorizer' responsibility is strictly to manage and enforce policy, then we probably want a `UserService` to manage user retrieval, modification, etc. Maybe this is injected into the authorizer to allow various identity provider implementations (LDAP, Kerberos, etc.) to work with various authorizers (Ranger, NiFi internal, etc.) I'm not going to hold up this step with the understanding there are still more design decisions to be made. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220464739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220467272","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/453#issuecomment-220467272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/453","id":220467272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDQ2NzI3Mg==","user":{"login":"eorgad","id":7086512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODY1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7086512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad","html_url":"https://github.com/eorgad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eorgad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-19T22:14:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T22:14:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Taking a dipper look at this, the the ScpTo.java code uses the following:\n...\n // exec 'scp -t rfile' remotely\n      String command=\"scp \" + (ptimestamp ? \"-p\" :\"\") +\" -t \"+rfile;\n      Channel channel=session.openChannel(\"exec\");\n      ((ChannelExec)channel).setCommand(command);\n\n```\n  // get I/O streams for remote scp\n  OutputStream out=channel.getOutputStream();\n  InputStream in=channel.getInputStream();\n```\n\n  ...\n  So implementing this would probably be the equivalent of invoking an ExecuteProcess \n  and providing it with the parameters for scp command.

The reason we cannot do that directly is the extension point that is getting discovered is an Authorizer. However, this did make me think of possibly changing the MutableAuthorizer into an abstract class which implements (and marks final) the authorize() method. Then the MutableAuthorizer would simply handle User/Group/Policy persistence. Maybe the name changes too... something like AbstractPolicyBasedAuthorizer. The NiFi internal implementation would look like\n\n`class FileAuthorizer extends AbstractPolicyBasedAuthorizer`\n\nWe'll hash out some of the details and update the PR accordingly. May be a good place to handle duplicate detection and whatnot.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220469545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220499039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/453#issuecomment-220499039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/453","id":220499039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDQ5OTAzOQ==","user":{"login":"mosermw","id":10587698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTg3Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10587698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw","html_url":"https://github.com/mosermw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mosermw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T01:59:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T01:59:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eorgad your interest and willingness to get involved with the NiFi community is certainly appreciated.  In this case, I don't think the Travis build failed on the code in this PR.  If you run \"mvn clean install -Pcontrib-check\" in your branch successfully, then that should give you confidence that your PR will be fine.\n\nI do think there is value to a PutSCP processor over using ExecuteProcess.  I personally wouldn't want to remember the specifics of the scp command in order to configure ExecuteProcess properly, so PutSCP would be a boon right there.\n\nI think special care is needed to design this processor to the strengths and limitations of the scp protocol.  For instance the PutSFTP processor will first sftp.put() to a temporary file, then sftp.rename() that temp file to the intended permanent name (this is to avoid the possibility that automated processes on the remote host pick up an incomplete file in the middle of transfer).  PutSFTP also has options to sftp.setMtime(), sftp.chmod(), and sftp.chown().  I'm not sure how much of this interaction is supported in the scp protocol.\n\nFor processors like ListSCP or GetSCP, which probably would need to rely on getting a directory listing on the remote host, I'm having a difficult time determining if the scp protocol can do this.  I can see a FetchSCP, though, when it's given a specific filename on the remote host to transfer into NiFi.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220499039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220607952","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/452#issuecomment-220607952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/452","id":220607952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDYwNzk1Mg==","user":{"login":"jtstorck","id":19271493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjcxNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19271493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck","html_url":"https://github.com/jtstorck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtstorck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T13:39:17Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T13:39:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 looks good to me at this point, though @mcgilman's earlier comment on making MutableAuthorizer a base class does sound good, since the idea of the MutableAuthorizer was not so much about the authorization, but about the management of users/groups/policies from the NiFi UI.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220607952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/220610191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/454#issuecomment-220610191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/454","id":220610191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDYxMDE5MQ==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-20T13:48:16Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T13:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mcgilman I agree, I do think it makes more sense to handle that in the Revision.
