@rhtyd Sorry for the delay in responding. I believe I have addressed all of your points except one (which I wanted to run past you before making any changes here).\r\n\r\nThe one remaining issue is with where to place the SIOC code.\r\n\r\nSIOC is short for VMware Storage I/O Control.\r\n\r\nInitially I placed it under plugins/api/solidfire-sioc because 1) I wanted it to extend the standard CloudStack API and I thought all API plug-ins needed to be placed in this location and 2) originally there was SolidFire-specific code in here (hence the naming of some folders).\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, in working with the customer for whom I originally developed this code (the SIOC code, that is), I was able to extract all SolidFire-specific references.\r\n\r\nHow's about this? If I go ahead and remove references to SolidFire from this SIOC code (ex. folder naming, file naming, etc.), would you be OK with me placing it here: plugins/api/sioc?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/355140092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/355141248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2365#issuecomment-355141248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2365","id":355141248,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTE0MTI0OA==","user":{"login":"khos2ow","id":372575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjU3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow","html_url":"https://github.com/khos2ow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khos2ow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-03T22:06:54Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T22:34:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner I don't know if we can have a clusters/hosts with different XS versions, but in any case I changed it again as follow\r\n- register only *one* iso with `name` of **xs-tools.iso** and `display_text` of **XenServer Tools Installer ISO (xen-pv-drv-iso)**\r\n- get the actual iso name (either _xs-tools.iso_ or _guest-tools.is_) on the fly based on `product_version` of `com.xensource.xenapi.Host.Record`\r\n\r\nin the future, if the name of iso changes again, only another `else` block will be needed in `CitrixResourceBase#actualIsoTemplate`\r\n  \r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/355141248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/355141747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2146#issuecomment-355141747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2146","id":355141747,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTE0MTc0Nw==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-03T22:09:11Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T22:09:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok, I see your point now, @rafaelweingartner. github had hidden the first few comments.
