Actually, this is a case from tutorial **extern op**, [link ](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/language/extern_op.html). After investigating, I have found this issue was introduced by #5417. See [diff](https://github.com/apache/tvm/commit/8d7249688771bb6806595931586d95648036f383?branch=8d7249688771bb6806595931586d95648036f383&diff=unified#diff-68d4c81453bf10caf7ae867ee644de009e7fed808ce871b54364d27134e920e7R186-R194).\r\n> \r\n> You can comment out this ICHECK as a workaround.\r\n> \r\n> ```c++\r\n> CHECK(GetUniqueName(packed_func_name) == packed_func_name) <<\r\n>         \"Expected name \" << packed_func_name << \" to not be taken\";\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n@leeexyz I found that 1) comment the ICHECK line 2) use export_library() and load_module() didn't solve all the problem. Still, the program is not able to compile:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4969797/111582831-5a341780-87f6-11eb-923e-9309228b2729.png)\r\n\r\nI think the root cause is \"tvm.contrib.cblas.matmul\" is not a qualified c variable name. Below is the c source file generated by tvmc backend:\r\n<img width=\"1558\" alt=\"WeChatWorkScreenshot_c4c8f1de-7a24-4c90-b39c-3e8a7f58088a\"

The level of documentation can be debatabe, while it is always good to add more details in the docs, we also cannot too hung up on things, to ensure timely delivery of the item, assuming the code quality is good and readable (in this case get other committers to read and understands the code logic).\r\n\r\nWhich such cases happens, we could apply the following principle - reviewers should strive to read and understand the code, and suggest comments that can be directly act upon to make sure merge happen in a reasonable pace. The merger/committer takes the responsibility in case future problem occurs to the case.\r\n\r\nIt is of course great to help further suggest improvements. Normally in such cases it would be great if reviewer can make suggestions that also facilitate merging in a quick way, especially comments that are directly actionable(e.g. suggest changes that can be directly applied to the code). This is particularly useful to help the code review move forward. Of course doing so would demands more time from the reviewer (to read and understand), but that is what we should strive to do in code reviews.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of actionable comment, please feel free to suggest more.\r\n\r\n### Example  Actionable Comment\r\n\r\nPlease add the following comment to enter_block:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNote\r\n------\r\nThis function is used for normal scopes that does not\r\ninvolve a `with block` scope.

It makes this PR much clearer and readable. I totally agree that great documentation is necessary for open-source projects. But I agree more with @junrushao1994 that we should distinguish who the documents are written for. We cannot write every doc for devs without any background. I think that the docs in TVM parser are written for developers who knows the TIR data structures. So that documents for data structures (e.g. block signature: reads/writes/match_buffer_region) are not necessary. But I have been making my effort to address actional items as much as possible, making things move on. Finally, I add the block example in `context_maintainer` to make everyone happy, although I still disagree it should be here.\r\n\r\nI have polished the code for many rounds together with my co-authors. I want to thank their efforts again for improving code quality. During development, I found some latent issues of TVMScript Parser. I just updated the following thing besides basic functional improvement:\r\n1. Type annotations for the Parser\r\n2. Fix error reporting issues left over by last PR (authored by @tkonolige)\r\n3. Add many test cases for Parser and error reporting (not only for new features of TensorIR)\r\n4. Add more document and assert checks lacking in the current version\r\n\r\nThis PR's original purpose is to add support for TensorIR, which is long about 1000 lines of code. But I just tried my best to improve code quality, and finally, the changes became to 2000+ lines. That's far more than what should an incrementally PR does. I'd love to try my best to polish code but not endless requests.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm happy to improve code quality and documentation. But it still to think about the tradeoff between readability and heavy documents.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/803371685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/803458288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7630#issuecomment-803458288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7630","id":803458288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzQ1ODI4OA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-20T20:24:37Z","updated_at":"2021-03-20T20:24:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thansk @Hzfengsy for continuous effort to improve this PR.
