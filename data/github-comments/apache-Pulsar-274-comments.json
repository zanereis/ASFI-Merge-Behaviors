Though both `MessageListener` and `ReceiveCallback` are `std::function` callbacks, they're much different. Let's see what Java API does first.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface MessageListener<T> extends Serializable {\r\n    /**\r\n     * This method is called whenever a new message is received.\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>Messages are guaranteed to be delivered in order and from the same thread for a single consumer\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>This method will only be called once for each message, unless either application or broker crashes.\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>Application is responsible for acking message by calling any of consumer acknowledgement methods.\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>Application is responsible of handling any exception that could be thrown while processing the message.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param consumer\r\n     *            the consumer that received the message\r\n     * @param msg\r\n     *            the message object\r\n     */\r\n    void received(Consumer<T> consumer, Message<T> msg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `MessageListener` is a real callback and it's noted that the callback is responsible for asking messages.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Receive a single message\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>Retrieves a message when it will be available and completes {@link CompletableFuture} with received message.\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>{@code receiveAsync()} should be called subsequently once returned {@code CompletableFuture} gets complete\r\n     * with received message. Else it creates <i> backlog of receive requests </i> in the application.\r\n     *\r\n     * <p>The returned future can be cancelled before completion by calling {@code .cancel(false)}\r\n     * ({@link CompletableFuture#cancel(boolean)}) to remove it from the the backlog of receive requests. Another\r\n     * choice for ensuring a proper clean up of the returned future is to use the CompletableFuture.orTimeout method\r\n     * which is available on JDK9+. That would remove it from the backlog of receive requests if receiving exceeds\r\n     * the timeout.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return {@link CompletableFuture}<{@link Message}> will be completed when message is available\r\n     */\r\n    CompletableFuture<Message<T>> receiveAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no `ReceiveCallback` in Java client because `receiveAsync` just returns a future of `Message`. C++ client has no future before C++11 while it seems that the Pulsar C++ client is written with C++03 initially. Even with C++11, the `std::future` is not so convenient as Java's `CompletableFuture`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, C++ client API usually passes an extra callback argument `std::function<Result, const T&>`  to replace Java API's `CompletableFuture<T>`.\r\n\r\nThe `receiveAsync` is only responsible for processing the future of `Message` but not how you acknowledge it. For example, you can also capture a list of `MessageId` and acknowledge it later.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    std::vector<MessageId> messageIds;\r\n    std::mutex mtx;\r\n\r\n    std::thread ackPeriodlyTask([&consumer, &messageIds, &mtx] {\r\n        while (true) { // TODO: add a flag to stop the task\r\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\r\n            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);\r\n            // TODO: you need to acknowledge all message ids if the subscription mode is Shared or Key_Shared\r\n            consumer.acknowledgeCumulative(messageIds.back());\r\n            messageIds.clear();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\r\n        consumer.receiveAsync([&messageIds, &mtx](Result result, const Message& msg) {\r\n            // TODO: handle `result` and `msg`\r\n            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);\r\n            messageIds.emplace_back(msg.getMessageId());\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we don't acknowledge each message because in failover subscription mode, it's unnecessary and inefficient. Though you can set `AckGrouingTimeMs` and `AckGroupingMaxSize` now, the above code is just an example. What I want to say is:\r\n\r\n- `receiveAsync` only focus on the received message in the future.\r\n- `MessageListener` requires you to handle the acknowledgement.\r\n\r\nThe difference makes that `MessageListener` has a `Consumer` parameter while `ReceiveCallback`
