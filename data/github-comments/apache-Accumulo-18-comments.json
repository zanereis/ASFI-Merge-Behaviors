Let me know if there are more or if I missed some. \r\n\r\nI do have a concern about one of the tests that I hope someone can assist me with. The 'testSetPropertiesAndGroups' test sets two generic properties and a locality group prior to creating the table. After creation I call conn.tableOperations().getProperties to retrieve the properties of the table. I check for the properties of the locality groups and I have tried checking for the generic properties as well. The locality group properties are retrieved without issue. But, the generic properties are not returned. I expected that I would see them as well. Am I missing some step in the setProperties process or misunderstanding the use of the NewTableConfiguration.setProperties method? I have followed through the code and  verified that when the CreateTable() constructor is eventually called the generic properties are still in the supplied options Map.

I doubt this bug has anything to do with your changes, it probably pre-existing.  I suspected the props were not showing up because they lacked the `table.` prefix and therefore were not table properties.  So I added the following and then your test worked.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    props.put(Property.TABLE_ARBITRARY_PROP_PREFIX.getKey()+\"prop1\", \"val1\");\r\n    props.put(Property.TABLE_ARBITRARY_PROP_PREFIX.getKey()+\"prop2\", \"val2\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what happened when you set the properties without the `table.` prefix?  Were they just silently dropped or was something actually set in zookeeper?  Seems like something should throw an exception when its not a valid table prop.  Could add some sanity checks to NewTableConfiguration in order to fail fast.  May want sanity checks on the server side where create table is processed also.

It should also give you more control over the repos on GitHub, and related things, too (like being able to close issues or merge PRs from the UI, and add/remove labels, update milestones, and trigger rebuilds and clear caches on Travis CI).\r\n\r\nIn any case, I would appreciate a review of this if/when you get a chance. I understand how important it was to fix the commons-config in our API for Hadoop 3, and I want to make sure this change is in the direction we can all agree on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/357380247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/358112042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/357#issuecomment-358112042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/357","id":358112042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODExMjA0Mg==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-16T21:27:48Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T21:27:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The latest updates leave a few methods from the superclass not deprecated, because we're using them in our own code.
