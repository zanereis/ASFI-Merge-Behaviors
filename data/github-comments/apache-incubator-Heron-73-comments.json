So far it did not work as expected. I do think we are very close.  I installed Heron by the following:\r\n\r\n**Note:** All commands are ran from the root directory of the project\r\n```\r\n$ bazel build --config=darwin_nostyle scripts/packages:binpkgs\r\n````\r\nThe above command's output is the install scripts. The location of the scripts will be echoed to the terminal.  Typically something like:\r\n```\r\n Target //scripts/packages:binpkgs up-to-date:\r\n  bazel-bin/scripts/packages/heron-install.sh\r\n```\r\n   I then executed them to install Heron.\r\n```\r\n$ ./bazel-bin/scripts/packages/heron-install.sh --user\r\n```\r\nI checked the heron version command.  All good.\r\n```\r\n$  heron version\r\nheron.build.git.revision : 1f80d5a20fbd146597de7dab3c94816a602239fd\r\nheron.build.git.status : Clean\r\nheron.build.host : Joshs-MacBook-Pro-2.local\r\nheron.build.time : Fri May 29 21:11:31 CDT 2020\r\nheron.build.timestamp : 1590804691000\r\nheron.build.user : joshfischer\r\nheron.build.version : python-3-upgrade\r\n```\r\nThen I started the tracker.  All good.\r\n```\r\n$ heron-tracker\r\n[2020-05-29 21:42:22 -0500] [INFO]: Connecting to file state with rootpath: /Users/joshfischer/.herondata/repository/state/local\r\n[2020-05-29 21:42:22 -0500] [INFO]: Tracker has started\r\n[2020-05-29 21:42:22 -0500] [INFO]: Running on port: 8888\r\n[2020-05-29 21:42:22 -0500] [INFO]: Using config file: /Users/joshfischer/.heron/conf/heron_tracker.yaml\r\n[2020-05-29 21:42:22 -0500] [INFO]: Using state manager:\r\n\ttype: file\r\n\tname: local\r\n\trootpath: ~/.herondata/repository/state/local\r\n\ttunnelhost: 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had issues when starting the UI tool of Heron. It looks like it could not find the `release.yaml` file.

We found that it does work, but there are some edge cases that can cause the topology StatefulSet to fail.\r\n\r\n1. TMaster looks for `/.dockerenv` to determine if Tmaster is running in a container. I have found situations in which the pod does not have this file (i.e. Kind and K3s) [Tmaster code](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/cc815d85305dc0b665a2ccb42113cf7a49b1eb0a/heron/executor/src/python/heron_executor.py#L232)\r\n2. If TMaster does find `/.dockerenv` it will try to use the `HOST` environment variable. I have found some use cases in which the Pod does not have this set (i.e. Kind).\r\n3. If both of these work, then the TMaster and Stmgr processes will use the pod's IP address. If either fails, then the `socket.hostname()` call will return the pod name, which is not stored in the Kubernetes cluster DNS.\r\n4. To enable the use of the hostname, we need to have a Headless Service registered.\r\n\r\nThe proposal:\r\n1. Update Kubernetes Scheduler code to create a matching Headless Service for each topology created.\r\n2. Update the Kubernetes Scheduler code to add a custom ENV variable on the StatefulSet (i.e. `HERON_HOSTNAME`)\r\n3. Update the TMaster logic that checks for `/.dockerenv` to instead first check for `HERON_HOSTNAME` variable.\r\n\r\nIf we make these changes, this issue would be resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/650497830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/650666131","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1981#issuecomment-650666131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1981","id":650666131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDY2NjEzMQ==","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-28T01:37:27Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T01:37:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Heron Kubernetes scheduler also now supports launching topologies using Kubernetes StatefulSets. I believe this issue has been satisfied with that functionality. There is still legacy code that launches the individual pods, but that most likely should be deprecated.\r\n\r\nI'm closing the issue, but feel free to submit any new issues for features that are still lacking.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/650666131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
