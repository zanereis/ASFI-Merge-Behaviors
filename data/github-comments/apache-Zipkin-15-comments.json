progress!

We can just use travis service/local cassandra for now (like we do today).\n- Mixed feelings about the separate `-java` and `-aggregate` projects. The artifact graph is already complex, and something we've been working hard to make sense of. Can we delay this optimization? For example, add a java source tree and make the deps for `-aggregate` optional. \n\nI can help look at the test, but any chance you can move this branch to openzipkin?

This is part of collateral damage needed to get zipkin running again. Hopefully, @eirslett could help add a new `-aggregate` codebase after this is merged (based on git history or from scratch).\n\nNeed some folks to weigh in, as I'd like to depend on this work in order
