Create a config in table that indicates that for a table we need the time boundary to be next unit up. (i.e. if daily push, next day, if hourly the next hour. etc.)\r\n2. Change the time boundary code to move up the time boundary when new segments are added to the table.\r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no new API, but for use cases that have multiple segments, the time boundary will be advanced when the first segment is pushed. This will lead to inconsistency. \r\n\r\nPinot currently has the inconsistency problem only if RT is not there, but we will be introducing a new one now.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, introduce an API as well, which can send out a message to the brokers to advnce time bondary. This API will be invoked by the push job when all segments are pushed. This iwll reduce the inconsistency window to some narrow cases such as:\r\n(1)  Three segments are being pushed. After the first one, a broker restarts, and lokoing at the table config, and the recent timestamp, advances the boundary. Since the other two segments are not pushed yet, the broker has no way of knowing that a message is going to come by later. Corner case, but maybe we can leave that for the day when we support \"atomic\" push of data.\r\n(2). Three segments are being pushed. The push complets, but the external view is not yet updated (slow server, slow helix, whatever). The broker meanwhile gets the message to move time boundary. \r\n\r\nThe second one is more likely to happen, but either one is a bad experience for the application. \r\n\r\nSome mitigation may be to include the segment names in the controller api and the controller waits for the EV of these segments to be ONLINE before issuing a message, but that is also not complete. Broker may still not see the new EV\r\n\r\nIdeas?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/663679922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/663784663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5737#issuecomment-663784663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5737","id":663784663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mzc4NDY2Mw==","user":{"login":"mcvsubbu","id":2279037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2279037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mcvsubbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcvsubbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-25T00:39:44Z","updated_at":"2020-07-25T00:39:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@npawar  please take another look, thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/663784663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/663788640","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5748#issuecomment-663788640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5748","id":663788640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mzc4ODY0MA==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-25T01:13:16Z","updated_at":"2020-07-25T01:13:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5748?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> :exclamation: No coverage uploaded for pull request base (`master@dab1c2d`).

In addition, there is a global flag in the configuration file that can turn on/off this feature.

The resource will only create a task and save it in to DB. The worker thread in the backend will asynchronously retrieve it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/666769896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/666903009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5728#issuecomment-666903009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5728","id":666903009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NjkwMzAwOQ==","user":{"login":"snleee","id":27253407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjUzNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27253407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee","html_url":"https://github.com/snleee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snleee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T04:02:01Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T04:02:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"#5728","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/666903009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/667167632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/5704#issuecomment-667167632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5704","id":667167632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzE2NzYzMg==","user":{"login":"mr-agrwal","id":24796847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Nzk2ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24796847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal","html_url":"https://github.com/mr-agrwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr-agrwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T15:04:17Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T15:04:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can take it up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/667167632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/667299037","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5769#issuecomment-667299037","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5769","id":667299037,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzI5OTAzNw==","user":{"login":"suvodeep-pyne","id":2577714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne","html_url":"https://github.com/suvodeep-pyne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suvodeep-pyne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T18:53:40Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T18:53:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @jasonyanwenl \r\n\r\nThanks for getting back to me. Just wanted to understand some things better:\r\n- I assume that the online worker must be on when such an API request is issued? What is the behavior if that is not the case?\r\n- I wanted to understand the necessity of having 2 TaskDrivers. How is an online TaskDriver different in behavior than an offline task driver? Same question for online detection task vs offline detection task.\r\n- Is this about prioritizing online tasks? If yes, have we considered having a priority attached to a task?\r\n\r\nSome comments on readability that have helped me:\r\n- First of all thank you! I would really encourage having small PRs. It just makes it really easy to review and push commits faster if the changes are small and focussed. Imagine not having the context and reviewing a 1300 line PR. \r\n- This can be across multiple files but addressing a single/few related issue(s).\r\n- Also smaller methods help. same logic: easier to read, refactor, test. And less code duplication.\r\n- Smaller classes. Starting with an 800 line Resource class makes it bit hard to read, maintain.\r\n\r\nApart this, I really like the utility of these APIs. Thanks for adding this!\r\n\r\nRegards","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/667299037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/667309936","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5774#issuecomment-667309936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/5774","id":667309936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzMwOTkzNg==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T19:20:47Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T19:20:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5774?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#5774](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5774?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/commit/1beaab59b73f26c4e35f3b9bc856b03806cddf5a&el=desc) will **decrease** coverage by `21.87%`.\n> The diff coverage is `56.01%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5774/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=4ibza2ugkz)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/5774?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@             Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master    #5774       +/-   ##\n===========================================\n- Coverage   66.44%   44.57%   -21.88%     \n===========================================\n  Files        1075     1141       +66     \n  Lines       54773    58755     +3982     \n  Branches     8168     8911      +743     \n===========================================\n- Hits        36396    26192    -10204     \n- Misses      15700    30228    +14528     \n+ Partials     2677     2335      -342     \n```\n\n| Flag | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| #integrationtests | `44.57% <56.01%> (?)` | |\n\nFlags with carried forward coverage won't be shown.
