Each document can have any structure and does not have to be associated with others in any way. As a last resort, we should create a file in the howto directory if there is no other better place. \r\n\r\nThe list of guides in no way allows you to create a documentation structure in any way. The documentation must be structured if it is to be user-friendly. I would like to limit the number of files in the howto directory, because it will not allow to create high-quality documentation in the long-term. \r\n\r\nCurrently, work is underway to create a better place for information that the milton0825 user would like to add. \r\nReference:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4827\r\n\r\nIf this change is accepted, we will have one place that will support the developer. The documentation will be able to have a structure. In the future, further documents are planned, which will describe other information for the developer ex. Google Integration Guide\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/af7637c61acbb877dc68f337b633b2c34a43f91a2ebafc61208daf0c@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nWe have only one environment described for now, but in the future we will have several environments described and work on the description is ongoing. One place for developer information is needed.\r\nReference:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4932/files\r\n\r\nI point out that the purpose of the documentation is to show how to do something, so the existence of this directory is not a good idea, but it is currently the shortest way to add a new element.  This is a good temporary solution, but it should not be recommended.\r\n\r\nSummary: \"howto\" is a better solution, as a short term solution. It is a place that is much more developer-accessible, but this is a worse solution in a longer period of time. \r\n\r\nCC: @potiuk ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/475143470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/475145977","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4898#issuecomment-475145977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4898","id":475145977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTE0NTk3Nw==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-21T08:30:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T08:30:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It is also worth noting that the information is only for developers.
