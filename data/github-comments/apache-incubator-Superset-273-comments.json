Neither of those tools do anything with type checking, hence the inclusion of `mypy`. `pylint` is the most annoying to deal with, IMHO, when it comes to code formatting issues. The bits of it I like are ensuring that classes inheriting from a parent don't alter method signatures, ensuring that classes implement all of the methods required by their abstract classes, and identifying classes and functions that are too big and should be broken up. I wonder if we could globally disable a larger percentage of the `pylint` rules to get away from some of this pain?\r\n\r\nI'd love to get this down to a single linter as well, but I'm wondering which checks we'd be willing to walk away from. I haven't seen a single linter that covers type checking, auto-formatting, and package sorting in the Python ecosystem right now, but I'd love to be proven wrong on that!\r\n\r\nThe main pain points I have:\r\n1. I have to run a bunch of different commands to see if my code will pass all the linters, and I usually miss one or more for N files in any PR where I'm making changes, even with auto-linting set up in PyCharm. I wonder if there is a way we could implement a `superset lint X` command that would do all the things at once and act as a controller for whatever linters we have in the project?\r\n2. `isort` and `black` disagreeing on whitespace when I'm trying to comment on an `import` statement\r\n3. `pylint: disable=` comments triggering `black` reformatting","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/565244146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/565256042","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8827#issuecomment-565256042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8827","id":565256042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTI1NjA0Mg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T01:03:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T01:03:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds totally reasonable.\r\n\r\n+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/565256042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/565304339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8818#issuecomment-565304339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/8818","id":565304339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTMwNDMzOQ==","user":{"login":"swapnil-chenoa","id":26441206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26441206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa","html_url":"https://github.com/swapnil-chenoa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnil-chenoa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T05:19:29Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T05:19:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> ok, that seems more or less ok.
