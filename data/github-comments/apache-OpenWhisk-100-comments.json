The kube deployment already was also mounting libAppArmor.so.1, but that isn't working (yet).  Perhaps the problem is as simple as also needing to fool around with /etc/ld.so.conf.d in the invoker container, but I haven't gotten it to work yet.  There might be additional dependencies that would need to be dragged in.\r\n\r\nHow would we make the logic for error on docker-runc ==> fallback to docker logic robust?  One could imagine a spurious error \"poisoning\" the container causing us to always use docker even though docker-runc would work most of the time?

@hykych! \r\n\r\nbasically there are two ways you deploy controllers: active-passive (one controller is active, another one becomes active if the first one fails), active-active (requests are dispatched for multiple controllers simultaneously). I think you mentioned the second case. \r\nSo for that we use akka cluster to share the number of activations per namespace and activations per invoker across cluster members.
