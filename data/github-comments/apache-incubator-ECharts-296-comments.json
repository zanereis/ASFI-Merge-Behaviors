 \r\n\r\nI think is OK to change `setAttr` to `setTransform`. I will try to modify it soon.\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure about support \"object input\" in those setter API. The reason is:\r\n+ When we call \"getter\", we also need to fetch one prop one calling.\r\n+ I guess in most cases only one or few attributes need to be modified in during. So may be \"object input\" helps little for \"API simple to use\".\r\n\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var points = makeShapePoints(\r\n        api, valOnRadius, apiDuring.getShape('valOnAngle')\r\n    );\r\n    apiDuring.setShape('points', points);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var points = makePionterPoints(params, apiDuring.getShape('polarEndRadian'));\r\n    apiDuring.setShape('points', points);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    apiDuring.setStyle('text', makeText(apiDuring.getShape('valOnRadian')));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var currContentColor = getColorInTransition(apiDuring, 'content');\r\n    apiDuring.setStyle('fill', currContentColor);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var points = makeShapePoints(\r\n        params,\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('widthRadius'),\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('startRadius'),\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('endRadian')\r\n    );\r\n    apiDuring.setShape('points', points);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn these cases above, \"object input\" does not help\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var iValOnAngle = apiDuring.getShape('valOnAngle');\r\n    var point = makeLabelPosition(api, valOnRadius, iValOnAngle);\r\n    apiDuring\r\n        .setTransform('x', point[0])\r\n        .setTransform('y', point[1])\r\n        .setStyle('text', getText(iValOnAngle));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var endRadian = apiDuring.getShape('endRadian');\r\n    var point = makeLabelPosition(\r\n        params,\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('widthRadius'),\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('startRadius'),\r\n        endRadian\r\n    );\r\n    apiDuring.setTransform('x', point[0]).setTransform('y', point[1]);\r\n    apiDuring.setStyle('text', makeText(endRadian));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn these cases above, \"object input\" helps, but not a significant improve:\r\n```js\r\nduring: function (apiDuring) {\r\n    var endRadian = apiDuring.getShape('endRadian');\r\n    var point = makeLabelPosition(\r\n        params,\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('widthRadius'),\r\n        apiDuring.getShape('startRadius'),\r\n        endRadian\r\n    );\r\n    apiDuring.setTransform({ x: point[0], y: point[1] });\r\n    apiDuring.setStyle('text', makeText(endRadian));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Support \"object input\" make the API to use a loop internally. This is a simple [performance comparison](https://jsperf.com/setter-try), where the \"object input\" is slower than the \"plain way\" 1/3. Not sure whether the time cost is not significant enough to worry about. I do not test them in low-end mobile device.\r\n+ The \"object input\" need to make \"overload\" in those method `setTransform` `setShape` `setStyle`. Little tedious in code.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/647476569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/647495244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/12834#issuecomment-647495244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12834","id":647495244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzQ5NTI0NA==","user":{"login":"liulinboyi","id":41336612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzM2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41336612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi","html_url":"https://github.com/liulinboyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liulinboyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-22T12:44:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T12:44:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @liulinboyi Would you mind providing a test case for this?\r\n\r\n@plainheart Test case is done, Please help review, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/647495244/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/647514112","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/12844#issuecomment-647514112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12844","id":647514112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzUxNDExMg==","user":{"login":"echarts-bot[bot]","id":45089189,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDUwODkxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/20872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echarts-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-22T13:18:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T13:18:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi!
