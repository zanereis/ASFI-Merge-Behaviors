However unlike most other Jena code the driver JARs often end up used standalone and dynamically loaded by arbitrary JDBC applications.\r\n\r\nThis means users often don't have the same opportunity to add their preferred logging framework that they normally would when using Jena libraries in a traditional Java application where those would just be one dependency amongst many.  Providing a default logging implementation in the drivers makes it easier for users to get useful logging out of them without any need to re-pack or re-compile the drivers since they can just provide a Log4j 2 configuration file at the JVM level.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/790474176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/792690624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/948#issuecomment-792690624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/948","id":792690624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MjY5MDYyNA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-08T11:26:26Z","updated_at":"2021-03-08T11:26:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rvesse -

I would imagine that continuously pinging that from the front-end wouldn't be very desirable.

And if you refresh the screen that's gone, you have no more access to the task progress.\r\n\r\nIn the branch where I am porting it to Vue, I am setting a permanent view for tasks that [updates every 10 seconds](https://github.com/kinow/jena/blob/7580da22cab35b6fbf76006c10544eeba851d84d/jena-fuseki2/jena-fuseki-ui/src/views/manage/Tasks.vue#L118-L126).\r\n\r\nBut my intention is to first have a replacement for Fuseki Backbone.js app, and then discuss the possibility of perhaps having a secure WebSockets that sends the data to the UI when available. This way we remove the polling, and can send information about any kind of server management tasks to the UI - so I think in the future we could show back up, compression, and other kinds of tasks if that would save users of having to log in to servers and run commands, or having to save HTTP requests to submit to the server.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/816210418/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/816562720","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/980#issuecomment-816562720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/980","id":816562720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjU2MjcyMA==","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-09T09:45:21Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T09:45:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I might submit another for /$/backups-list and /$/backup/*\r\n\r\n@bsara -- yes, please.
