Not only the SQL interface allows faster development cycles on streaming analytics, but also opens up the opportunities to unify batch data processing like <span class=\"error\">&#91;Apache Hive&#93;</span>(///hive.apache.org) and real-time streaming data analytics.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +At a very high level StormSQL compiles the SQL queries to <span class=\"error\">&#91;Trident&#93;</span>(Trident-API-Overview.html) topologies and executes them in Storm clusters. This document provides information of how to use StormSQL as end users. For people that are interested in more details in the design and the implementation of StormSQL please refer to the <span class=\"error\">&#91;this&#93;</span>(storm-sql-internal.html) page.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Usage<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Run the ``storm sql`` command to compile SQL statements into Trident topology, and submit it to the Storm cluster<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +$ bin/storm sql <sql-file> <topo-name><br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +In which `sql-file` contains a list of SQL statements to be executed, and `topo-name` is the name of the topology.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Supported Features<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The following features are supported in the current repository:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +* Streaming from and to external data sources<br/>\n    +* Filtering tuples<br/>\n    +* Projections<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Specifying External Data Sources<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +In StormSQL data is represented by external tables. Users can specify data sources using the `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement. For example, the following statement specifies a Kafka spouts and sink:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE FOO (ID INT PRIMARY KEY) LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=test' TBLPROPERTIES '{\"producer\":{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\",\"acks\":\"1\",\"key.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.IntSerializer\",\"value.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.ByteBufferSerializer\"}}'<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The syntax of `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` closely follows the one defined in <span class=\"error\">&#91;Hive Data Definition Language&#93;</span>(<a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL</a>).<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Plugging in External Data Sources<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Users plug in external data sources through implementing the `ISqlTridentDataSource` interface and registers them using the mechanisms of Java's service loader. The external data source will be chosen based on the scheme of the URI of the tables. Please refer to the implementation of `storm-sql-kafka` for more details.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Example: Filtering Kafka Stream<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Let's say there is a Kafka stream that represents the transactions of orders. Each message in the stream contains the id of the order, the unit price of the product and the quantity of the orders. The goal is to filter orders where the transactions are significant and to insert these orders into another Kafka stream for further analysis.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The user can specify the following SQL statements in the SQL file:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ORDERS (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, UNIT_PRICE INT, QUANTITY INT) LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=orders' TBLPROPERTIES '{\"producer\":{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\",\"acks\":\"1\",\"key.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.IntSerializer\",\"value.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.ByteBufferSerializer\"}}'<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE LARGE_ORDERS (ID INT PRIMARY KEY, TOTAL INT) LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=large_orders' TBLPROPERTIES '{\"producer\":{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\",\"acks\":\"1\",\"key.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.IntSerializer\",\"value.serializer\":\"storm.kafka.ByteBufferSerializer\"}}'<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +INSERT INTO LARGE_ORDERS SELECT ID, UNIT_PRICE * QUANTITY AS TOTAL FROM ORDERS WHERE UNIT_PRICE * QUANTITY > 50<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The first statement defines the table `ORDER` which represents the input stream. The `LOCATION` clause specifies the ZkHost (`localhost:2181`), the path of the brokers in ZooKeeper (`/brokers`) and the topic (`orders`). The `TBLPROPERTIES` clause specifies the configuration of <span class=\"error\">&#91;KafkaProducer&#93;</span>(<a href=\"http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs</a>).<br/>\n    +Current implementation of `storm-sql-kafka` requires specifying both `LOCATION` and `TBLPROPERTIES` clauses even though the table is read-only or write-only.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Similarly, the second statement specifies the table `LARGE_ORDERS` which represents the output stream. The third statement is a `SELECT` statement which defines the topology: it instructs StormSQL to filter all orders in the external table `ORDERS`, calculates the total price and inserts matching records into the Kafka stream specified by `LARGE_ORDER`.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +To run this example, users need to include the data sources (`storm-sql-kafka` in this case) and its dependency in the class path. One approach is to put the required jars into the `extlib` directory:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +$ cp curator-client-2.5.0.jar curator-framework-2.5.0.jar zookeeper-3.4.6.jar<br/>\n    + extlib/<br/>\n    +$ cp scala-library-2.10.4.jar kafka-clients-0.8.2.1.jar kafka_2.10-0.8.2.1.jar metrics-core-2.2.0.jar extlib/<br/>\n    +$ cp json-simple-1.1.1.jar extlib/<br/>\n    +$ cp storm-kafka-<b>.jar storm-sql-kafka-</b>.jar storm-sql-runtime-*.jar extlib/<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The next step is to submit the SQL statements to StormSQL:<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +$ bin/storm sql order_filtering order_filtering.sql<br/>\n    +```<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +By now you should be able to see the `order_filtering` topology in the Storm UI.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +## Current Limitations<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Aggregation, windowing and joining tables are yet to be implemented. Specifying parallelism hints in the topology is not yet supported.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +Users also need to provide the dependency of the external data sources in the `extlib` directory. Otherwise the topology will fail to run because of `ClassNotFoundException`.<br/>\n    +<br/>\n    +The current implementation of the Kafka connector in StormSQL assumes both the int=put and the output are in JSON formats. The connector has not yet recognized the `INPUTFORMAT` and `OUTPUTFORMAT` clauses yet.<br/>\n    &#8212; End diff &#8211;</p>\n\n<p>    +1 for the nice work. Just minor comment here. <br/>\n    Can we have a detailed full list here of what SQL syntax are supposed to be supported?  Then the user or dev can track what are supported or un-supported now. e.g. I have no ieda if we are going to support something like \"distinct\", \"udf\"....</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612683580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/163497824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/886#issuecomment-163497824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/886","id":163497824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzQ5NzgyNA==","user":{"login":"qianlongzju","id":769655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/769655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju","html_url":"https://github.com/qianlongzju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qianlongzju/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T05:55:48Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T05:55:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@darionyaphet  not `topology-id` but `topology-name`?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/163497824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/163507898","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/886#issuecomment-163507898","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/886","id":163507898,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzUwNzg5OA==","user":{"login":"zhuoliu","id":11683054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjgzMDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11683054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuoliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-10T06:08:44Z","updated_at":"2015-12-10T06:10:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@darionyaphet, in 0.10 and before, worker log file has topology-id and port in its name.

@d2r @zhuoliu  As Arun said above if the current worker-port.log is in root dir it will be helpful to tail the logs. This preferable but not necessary. My main concern is we are not using storm.log.dir and adding logs to storm-local dir which is supposed to be used to store storm metadata dir and other topology metadata not application logs. And changing log location of topologies while using storm.log.dir is not a desired behavior.

It is not impossible to do, but it would add quite a bit of complexity to something that is already more complex then I like.\n\nI guess it comes down to how often do you and your customers access the logs through the storm UI or some other automated log system vs how often you access the logs by going to the box directly and reading them directly.
