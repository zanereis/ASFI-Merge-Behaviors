I think whether to consider adding one more SubmitTime field to TaskExecutionContext to solve this inconsistency problem. Another question is, I looked at the handling of the host by the dev branch. I have a question, why the host is not updated in `TaskPriorityQueueConsumer#dispatch`, but is updated in ack, looking forward to your answer","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1077034900/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1077036162","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/8862#issuecomment-1077036162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/8862","id":1077036162,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5AMkSC","user":{"login":"zhongjiajie","id":15820530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODIwNTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15820530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T03:40:35Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T03:40:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> You mean projectName is unique within the user-group and can be displayed with the same projectName from different user-groups during scheduling?\r\n\r\nYeah, that's what I mean.

你好,@caishunfeng,在#9085的pr中，你在submitTaskInstanceToDB方法中设置了SubmitTime，但我不觉得这是一个好的解决方法，因为先保存了SubmitTime，然后在分发任务，把任务放进了队列中，当取出任务处理后再更新了一次SubmitTime，导致这值不一致。我觉得是否考虑在TaskExecutionContext中添加多一个SubmitTime字段，解决这个不一致的问题。另一个问题是，我看了下dev分支对host的处理，我有一个疑问，为什么`TaskPriorityQueueConsumer#dispatch`中不更新host了，而是在ack中更新，期待你的解答\r\n> \r\n> ---- 翻译\r\n> \r\n> hi, @caishunfeng, in the pr of #9085, you set the SubmitTime in the submitTaskInstanceToDB method, but I don't think this is a good solution, because the SubmitTime is saved first, and then the task is distributed and the task is put into the queue , the SubmitTime is updated once after the task is taken out and processed, resulting in inconsistent values. I think whether to consider adding one more SubmitTime field to TaskExecutionContext to solve this inconsistency problem. Another question is, I looked at the handling of the host by the dev branch. I have a question, why the host is not updated in `TaskPriorityQueueConsumer#dispatch`, but is updated in ack, looking forward to your answer\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply. I agree with you about double save submitTime. In the original design, submitTime means that the time submit to DB. Maybe add the new field such as 'dispatchTime' is better.\r\nBecause of the wrong process, pr was directly merged into the 2.0.x branch and did not feedback to dev.(Normal process should change dev and cherry-pick to 2.0.x branch), so dev lost this change. But I had submited a pr #8719 which also do the same change, you can take a look, thanks.

Search before asking\n\n- [X] I had searched in the [issues](https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and found no similar issues.\n\n\n### What happened\n\nVersion is 1.3.9\r\nI have 9 tasks that need to be executed every 9 days.\r\nWhen I set the parameters as:\r\nYear: Default\r\nmonth: default\r\nDays: start from day 1 every 9 days (fill in the remaining tasks in sequence from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\r\nHour: 0:00\r\nScore: 0\r\nseconds: 0 seconds\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\n\n### What you expected to happen\n\nE.g:\r\nThere are 31 days in January, if my task 1 is executed from the first day, then when it executes to the 31st, task 4 is being executed. I expected task 5 on February 1st, but it turned out to be task 1.\r\nquestion:\r\nWhen task 4 is executed on January 31st, I expected that task 5 should be executed on February 1st, but the result is task 1.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nI have 9 tasks that need to be executed every 9 days.\r\nWhen I set the parameters as:\r\nYear: Default\r\nmonth: default\r\nDays: start from day 1 every 9 days (fill in the remaining tasks in sequence from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\r\nHour: 0:00\r\nScore: 0\r\nseconds: 0 seconds\n\n### Anything else\n\nIf I want to execute tasks according to my logic, is there any other way of choreography? Is it a bug or something else.\n\n### Version\n\n1.3.9\n\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\n\n- [ ] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's
