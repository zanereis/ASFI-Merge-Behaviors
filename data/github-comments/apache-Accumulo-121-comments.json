The Thrift messaging / RPC changes\r\n2. The changes to Compactor (which needs to be renamed to TaskWorker) around the TASK_RUNNER_WORKER_TYPE property.\r\n\r\nThe basic gist of the design here is:\r\n\r\n1. A TaskWorker process (currently known as Compactor) is started with the property TASK_RUNNER_WORKER_TYPE, which has values COMPACTION, LOG_SORTING, SPLIT_POINT_CALCULATION. That instance of the TaskWorker only perform jobs of the configured type.\r\n2. The TaskWorker gets the next job from the TaskManager (currently known as the CompactionCoordinator) by making a call via the Tasks Thrift API to the Manager.\r\n3. The TaskManager returns the next highest priority task of the given type (COMPACTION, LOG_SORTING, SPLIT_CALCULATION).\r\n4. The TaskWorker executes the Task and reports status back the TaskManager.\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, I'm probably about 80-85% done at this point.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1743468002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1743535068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3770#issuecomment-1743535068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3770","id":1743535068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5n7Dvc","user":{"login":"DomGarguilo","id":47725857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI1ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47725857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo","html_url":"https://github.com/DomGarguilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-02T18:29:36Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T18:29:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Wow, you did a good job presenting us with a lot of good options. Here are my thoughts from looking at the example images (didn't look at the code changes at all yet):\r\n> \r\n> 1. Bootstrap Icons [has better fonts](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#icon-font) that we can use for the alert character. Instead of using the SVGs, I'd go ahead and download and include the bootstrap icons font files, and use the CSS classes to style the icon, because that seems easier to work with once the fonts are in place. It's basically adding another (small) dependency to the monitor's external resources, but I think it's worth it, and we can take advantage of some of the other icons later, if we want, once it's added.\r\n> 2. I don't think we need to explicitly say \"System-wide Notifications\". I think just having the alert window there is enough. If the icon in the box is the same as in the nav bar, and both are on every page, then the connection is pretty intuitive that it's system-wide. There are [examples of icons in alert boxes in the Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/alerts/#icons) that I think look good, and they use the bootstrap icons I mentioned (although, their examples use the SVG instead of the font, which is annoying, because there aren't great examples of using the fonts... even though they should be easier to use).\r\n\r\nI went ahead and implemented these first two points in the past could commits. I replaced the existing svgs with their icon equivalents and removed the svgs. I also removed the title on the new alert and just replaced it with the icon. I agree that it does not need the title but was not too sure where to place the icon in relation to the unordered list within the alerts. Here is what things look like now:\r\n\r\n \r\n![Screenshot from 2023-10-02 14-24-53](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/assets/47725857/9c4d2986-7580-431f-a845-66e47d447156)\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-10-02 14-21-44](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/assets/47725857/d1555a08-99c4-4d7e-967e-44e4adb539a3)\r\n\r\n\r\n> 3. I like the colors and overall appearance of the alert box more than the accordian, but I do really like the ability to minimize or dismiss it. I'm thinking that we should stick with the alert box, but add the [dismiss feature](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/alerts/#dismissing)). Then, we can make it so the alert comes back if you click the icon in the nav bar (\"un-dismissing\"? ðŸ˜º). I think you'd have to register an action on the dismiss button, so we can track that it has been dismissed in the local storage, so it doesn't come back when you refresh. Making it show by clicking on the icon in the nav bar is easier.\r\n\r\nI'll start working on this part now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1743535068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1744159786","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3802#issuecomment-1744159786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3802","id":1744159786,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5n9cQq","user":{"login":"ddanielr","id":12480877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDgwODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12480877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr","html_url":"https://github.com/ddanielr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-03T04:21:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T04:21:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Relates to #3693. \r\n\r\nThe candidates could be written to the metadata table again at the end of the `replaceDatafiles` method.\r\nWhile this would fix the race condition, they would be in a separate mutation than the tablet references and could fail to write in the event of tserver process death.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1744159786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1745147345","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3800#issuecomment-1745147345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3800","id":1745147345,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5oBNXR","user":{"login":"jmark99","id":31573345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTczMzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31573345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99","html_url":"https://github.com/jmark99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmark99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-03T14:53:34Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T14:53:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@keith-turner, @ctubbsii  I like the idea of `sethostinggoal` and `gethostinggoal`.

It will be similar to computing splits.  Wondering how all of these should return data.   If the manager stores results in memory then it has to store the data until the FATE operation runs again and is ready to consume it.  Thinking it could write the result to the metadata table instead of storing it in manager memory, maybe something like the following.\r\n\r\n 1. Fate op needs computation done for tablet and queues a task and then exits (fate will run it later)\r\n 2. The task eventually runs on a worker, computes the result, and then writes the result to the tablets row in the metadata table.\r\n 3.

It's a little weird that they throw EOFException for that scenario in the first place.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1745716810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1745851316","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3807#issuecomment-1745851316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3807","id":1745851316,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5oD5O0","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-03T22:55:13Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T22:55:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"With this change and the changes in #3796, ShellServerIT may run which means that `mvn verify -Psunny` may run for the elasiticity branch","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1745851316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1746120218","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3693#issuecomment-1746120218","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3693","id":1746120218,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5oE64a","user":{"login":"ddanielr","id":12480877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDgwODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12480877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr","html_url":"https://github.com/ddanielr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T04:35:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T04:35:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" Linking #3805 to handle the scan ref case for inuse candidate deletions.

Wondering about the following.\r\n\r\nWhere things run?  Maybe instead of having a task runner executable, task runner is more of an internal code library that user facing executable components instantiate.  For example thinking through what the user facing accumulo commands could look like and what they could do.\r\n\r\n```\r\naccumulo compactor  -- runs compactions, instantiates a task runner in its impl to make this happen\r\naccumulo tserver    -- hosts tablets and does log sorts, it runs a task runner inside of a tablet server process to do log sorts\r\naccumulo manager    -- runs fate, assigns tablets, does split calculations... non-primary manager processes can run a task runner process to do split calculations\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat task return?  Maybe nothing, could we structure all task such that there is no return of data to manager?  A task runner gets a task from the manager, runs it, and when done gets another task. It never reports completion to the manager or status.\r\n\r\n  - compaction task run the compaction and commit it to the metadata table as part of the task\r\n  - compaction task do not report stats back to the manager, but only to the metrics system.

Wondering about the following.\r\n> \r\n\r\nYeah, let's find a time.\r\n\r\n> Where things run? Maybe instead of having a task runner executable, task runner is more of an internal code library that user facing executable components instantiate. For example thinking through what the user facing accumulo commands could look like and what they could do.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> accumulo compactor  -- runs compactions, instantiates a task runner in its impl to make this happen\r\n> accumulo tserver    -- hosts tablets and does log sorts, it runs a task runner inside of a tablet server process to do log sorts\r\n> accumulo manager    -- runs fate, assigns tablets, does split calculations... non-primary manager processes can run a task runner process to do split calculations\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nWith on-demand tablets it's possible that a user only has enough TabletServers running to host the root and metadata tables - that would be my only concern with doing log sorting in the TabletServer. I do like the idea of non-primary managers doing some of this work (which BTW I had working a while back in #3262 ). If we could leverage the non-primary managers, then this PR could likely be closed leaving the compactors the way that they are today. I think we should explore that idea sooner rather than later. There was another item mentioned in #3796 - compaction selection functionality. If we performed compaction selection and split calculations in the non-primary manager, left compactors the way they are today, then we just need a server component to run log sorting. IIRC from #3262 you can have multiple non-primary managers.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> What task return? Maybe nothing, could we structure all task such that there is no return of data to manager? A task runner gets a task from the manager, runs it, and when done gets another task. It never reports completion to the manager or status.\r\n> \r\n> * compaction task run the compaction and commit it to the metadata table as part of the task\r\n> * compaction task do not report stats back to the manager, but only to the metrics system.  Could the monitor get the data it needs?  Maybe the monitor contacts task runners directly if it wants info?\r\n> * log sort task sort the logs and create the appropriate dirs in hdfs when done\r\n> * split task could update the metadata table with the needed information instead of reporting back\r\n> \r\n> If task do not return anything, then that simplifies the thrift API and the manager possibly. Would not need to worry about keeping info in memory in the manager and keeping that info consistent and avoiding using to much memory.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1750541282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1750777038","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/3801#issuecomment-1750777038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3801","id":1750777038,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5oWrzO","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-06T14:28:37Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T14:28:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> If we could leverage the non-primary managers, then this PR could likely be closed leaving the compactors the way that they are today.\r\n\r\nI think this PR is still, useful but maybe scoped down.

I think this is good development practice, and results in more modular code design, which is easier to maintain. It also helps with release and feature planning when things aren't so co-dependent and tightly coupled. I'm fine with targeting elasticity, though, if the benefits of doing so are substantial.\r\n\r\nOn the two points @keith-turner mentioned:\r\n* The conditional mutation work isn't done yet, nor is the removal of table locks, but that's also a feature that could be done outside of the elasticity branch (possibly). It's also possible that conditional mutations can be used for this feature, without the other work in the metadata tables using conditional mutations yet, since conditional mutations are a per-write feature, not a per-table feature. I agree that there's a good chance that this may be easier or save some work by starting in the elasticity branch, because of how it relates to those things, but right now, I think this is all very speculative, as there are so many things in flight. I think think it's worth considering those things, but also making an effort to think of how it can be done independently, as the exploration of this feature proceeds.\r\n* The use cases for this may primarily exist in the elasticity branch, but that's not an argument against doing this incrementally with some progress in the main branch. If the dependency is one way, there's no reason we couldn't make some incremental changes in the main branch that is utilized more heavily later. Right now, I think it's too early to say what that might look like, since this is still at an exploratory stage.\r\n\r\nI'm okay with starting the exploration in elasticity branch, but please consider putting in some effort to make things modular and work towards incremental progress, wherever possible. If it doesn't strictly need to be implemented in the elasticity branch, I'd prefer it not be. I'd much rather make incremental progress in the main branch than dump everything into elasticity, with an all-or-nothing approach... if we can help it (we might not be able to help it... it may still make sense to bundle it all in elasticity, and if so, I'll accept that... I just don't think it's inevitable yet).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1758043415/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1758045942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3559#issuecomment-1758045942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/3559","id":1758045942,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5oyab2","user":{"login":"ddanielr","id":12480877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDgwODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12480877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr","html_url":"https://github.com/ddanielr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddanielr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T16:15:49Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T16:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are also specific system operations that are table agnostic.\r\n\r\nShutting down a tserver creates a FATE operation to accomplish that task.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/main/server/manager/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/manager/ManagerClientServiceHandler.java#L322-L323 \r\n\r\nIf that tserver is causing system issues, this specific FATE operation might need to be prioritized over other FATE types. \r\n\r\nIt might help to separate the FATEs into specific categories to determine proper storage locations.
