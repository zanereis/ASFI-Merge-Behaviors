have few experience on CloudFoundry, and didn`t try to run OW on it.\r\nBut I have experience on running OW with Swarm.\r\nYou may refer to it.\r\n\r\nSince CloudFoundry is PaaS, I guess it might provide docker in a similar way with Swarm.\r\n\r\nIn Swarm, it provides a single docker endpoint which accepts docker run request.\r\nIt will deploy a container on one of(few of) its agent machines.\r\nScheduling is managed by swarm manager.\r\nSo user can only care about a single docker endpoint to run container on docker cluster.\r\n\r\nBut in OpenWhisk, it is deployed via ansible which requires ssh access to host machine.\r\nAnd Openwhisk Invoker communicates with local docker engine.\r\nIt requires docker unix socket as well as volume mapping of docker RootDir.\r\nTo find out the RootDir of docker, it uses docker remote api.\r\n(Docker remote api is used in other parts also)\r\n\r\nTo sum up,\r\n\r\n1. SSH access on docker host\r\n2. Remote docker api should be enabled.\r\n3. Access on host(volume mapping of docker RootDir)\r\n\r\nThere could be more things to consider, but in my case(Swarm), it was working with those things.\r\nI am not sure these are allowed in CloudFoundry.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps you.\r\n\r\nAnd for the next time, you may want to join [slack](http://slack.openwhisk.org/) or subscribe mailing list: dev@openwhisk.incubator.apache.org.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/292057742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/292116632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1953#issuecomment-292116632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1953","id":292116632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjExNjYzMg==","user":{"login":"RSulzmann","id":7000561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann","html_url":"https://github.com/RSulzmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RSulzmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-06T09:18:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T09:18:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/2114\r\n\r\nNew behaviour:\r\n\r\n`wsk action invoke <name> --result`\r\ninvokes the action implicit as blocking invocation.\r\nIf --result is specified, --blocking can be omitted.\r\n\r\nSpecifying --blocking and --result still works.
