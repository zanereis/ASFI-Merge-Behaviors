done a bit of further research on this code and I think I’ve come up with a decent plan forward. I’m writing it down here for my own benefit, to see if I have all the missing parts, and for @chewbranca and @nickva to +1 the plan.\r\n\r\nI’ve identified two independent issues with this module, both stem from it being fundamentally being designed for CouchDB 1.x and the 2.x port being done rather haphazardly in the past (by me).\r\n\r\n**Problem No. 1:** this module gets started on each node in a cluster, each listening to `_changes` on `_users` and each trying to create the associated db. This can lead to conflicts on the `_dbs` db, which isn’t a fun situation as per @chewbranca above.\r\n\r\n**Problem No. 2:** this module doesn’t handle the case of the node it being run on failing and restarting. This is less an issue, if Problem No. 1 isn’t solved yet, as in a typical cluster there are at least two more instances of this module running that could create the database.\r\n\r\nBut say we fix Problem No. 1 (as outlined above) so that each user creation will only ever result in a single attempt to create the associated database. Then, what should happen if in between picking up the notification to create the database and doing the DB creation, the current node becomes unavailable?\r\n\r\nThe module currently opens `_changes` on startup and asserts all user/db creations corresponding to the `_users` db. That is, if there are 100k users, on startup, the module will try to create 100k databases, even if they already exist.\r\n\r\nA solution to this would be to add per-node high-watermark `_local/` docs, so we can more efficiently resume, but I’ll keep this as out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution to Problem No. 1 as outline by @nickva is to re-use the replicator’s code that makes sure a replication is only run on a single node (and specifically on the node that handles the shard that the `_replicator` document is part of. All of this is neatly encapsulated in the `couch_replicator_clustering` module.\r\n\r\nThat module is structured in a way that it can tell, given a `DbName` and a `DocId`, which active node in a cluster should handle a given action (replication by default, but we want user creation). All nodes participating will independently come to the same conclusion, ensuring an operation is only handled once.\r\n\r\nI propose to keep the behaviour of running the peruser module on each node in the cluster, but modify it’s changes handler to make use of `couch_replicator_clustering`’s ability to decide which node should handle an incoming user creation/deletion, since at that point, we do have the same input as the replicator code has.\r\n\r\nOne concern is the use of `couch_replicator_clustering` outside of the replicator. We should make this a standalone module, but at the moment it depends on some other replicator infrastructure (`couch_replicator_notifier`) and I’d say it is out of scope to make things more generic. That probably means we must make sure that peruser is loaded after the replicator.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334919162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334943382","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/756#issuecomment-334943382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/756","id":334943382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDk0MzM4Mg==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-07T15:29:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T15:29:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Latest push solves Problem No. 1.

Replicator uses a minute, we might want to have something less than that.\r\n\r\nHere is how that configuration is passed to the stability monitoring gen_server:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch_replicator/src/couch_replicator_clustering.erl#L143-L149\r\n\r\nNote that's a gen_server that's linked against your gen-server and would be a separate instance of it running in couch_replicator, rexi and your code:\r\n\r\n(rexi example as well: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/rexi/src/rexi_server_mon.erl#L69-L70)\r\n\r\nAlso @chewbranca gets the credit for the idea of re-using replicator code, that was a good insight and should solve the problem nicely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334949499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334949659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/756#issuecomment-334949659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/756","id":334949659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDk0OTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-07T16:53:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T16:53:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickva excellent comments, I’ll get that sorted :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334949659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/334952224","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/756#issuecomment-334952224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/756","id":334952224,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDk1MjIyNA==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-07T17:28:02Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T17:28:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nickva I think I found the reason `owner/2` lives in couch_replication_clustering for now: it depends on `is_stable()` which depends on the gen_server’s state.

Someone wants to authorise an operation with a token. If its timestamp is older than our now timestamp, we reject it.\r\n\r\n3. The user logs out and our application sends an \"invalidate\" request to the server. The server updates the now timestamp and adds an \"invalidated\" flag to it.\r\n\r\n4. All tokens coming in are now rejected because of the flag. We have succeeded in invalidating any tokens still out there.\r\n\r\n5. The rightful user logs in again with his credentials. Upon verification we update the now timestamp and remove the \"invalidated\" flag. The user gets a fresh stateless token.\r\n\r\n6. All other tokens are still invalid because they have an older timestamp.\r\n\r\nEven though we store data on the server, this is still stateless in terms of scalability, because timestamp and invalidated flag are per-user (e. g. like the password) and not per-session. Plus, eventual consistency is good enough here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/335317516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/335366388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/756#issuecomment-335366388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/756","id":335366388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTM2NjM4OA==","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T05:39:28Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T07:37:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great work, @janl !

A database that gives bad answers to queries is more a bug that needs to be patched backwards, not something we cut the cord on and just bump version numbers.\r\n\r\nThere is of course the issue around notifying users that a pending change may break their application (technically fix, but users have a different perspective :), so this is definitely something we should talk about. We'll also want to update the documentation as we've long said that using column prefixes was a suggestion for sharing indexes so that'll need to be fixed.\r\n\r\nFor @tonysun83's example of this changing a query from something that uses _all_docs to something that uses an existing index I don't think that's an issue. Originally I would have ixnayed it because of the lack of range restriction on A and B but we've already relaxed that by having an _all_docs default. Also the behavior here is different than the issue introduced by #816 in that previously Tony's example would have been an incorrect sort returned where the new version changes that (ie, same set of docs would be returned both places, just now its sorted). Which I think is quite a bit different than subtley different sets of documents returned. Also, if a user specifies a sort and isn't detecting the wrong sort order based on the _all_docs fall back then I'm failing to see how they'd be relying on that sort, and thus fixing it seems like not an issue.\r\n\r\nFor #816 with the _all_docs fallback is that also not more of a concern about performance rather than an app that stops working? Ie, all queries will continue to work and be \"fixed\" but some unknown number of queries will suddenly switch to using _all_docs and become much slower? Granted suddenly slower performance that lasts until an index can be built isn't nothing either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/335570620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/335639492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/863#issuecomment-335639492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/863","id":335639492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTYzOTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"tonysun83","id":6991573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTE1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6991573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83","html_url":"https://github.com/tonysun83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonysun83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-10T23:42:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T23:42:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@willholley : Can you remind me of the corner cases where index-everything text indexes would return different results than _all_docs?

My setup is a small cluster, with just 3 nodes continuously replicating a few databases from another, bigger one. Only 3 databases out of all the ones being replicated hold attachments and, by chance, the same node is responsible for replicating the 3 of them. That node throws the described error quite often (a few thousand times per hour), depending on the speed at which documents are received.\r\n\r\nThat particular node shows a continuous increment on the `process_count` metric read from the `_system` endpoint. Growing at a similar rate of this errors' rate. That metric grows from about 1.2k processes that the nodes start with up to a bit above 5k when it gets *frozen*. It stops responding on the clustered (5984) endpoint and doesn't replicate any more data. But annoyingly it is not considered as down in the cluster, so the other nodes are not taking his responsibilities over.\r\n\r\nAfter connecting the Observer to that node, to see which processes are there I could see a lot of `erlang:apply/2` in function `couch_httpd_multipart:maybe_send_data/1` with 0 reductions and 0 messages in the queue and also a lot of `mochiweb_acceptor:init/4` in function `couch_doc:-doc_from_multi_part_stream/3-fun-1-/1` Some of them with 1 message on the queue, some of them with 0 and 0 reductions as well...\r\n\r\nAlso this node has quite many 'erlang:apply/2' processes in function 'couch_http_multipart:mp_parse_attrs/2'.\r\n\r\nI think there may be something preventing the processes from exiting and that's why they pile up until it freezes.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/336514161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/336522571","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/888#issuecomment-336522571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/888","id":336522571,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjUyMjU3MQ==","user":{"login":"wohali","id":112292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjI5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali","html_url":"https://github.com/wohali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wohali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T17:50:02Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T17:50:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for this PR @adrianomelo !

Not all features from the old module (couch_httpd) have been ported to the new module. In addition, the way CouchDB 1.x is put together is not what modern idiomatic Erlang applications look like, and 2.x cleaned a lot of that up.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/338282777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/338303891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/733#issuecomment-338303891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/733","id":338303891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODMwMzg5MQ==","user":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T19:40:53Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T19:40:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"please reopen with requested info","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/338303891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
