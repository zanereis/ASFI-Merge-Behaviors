Instead of mutating dataframe columns names, I feel like we should target SQLAlchemy labels (aliases) (upstream).\r\n\r\nThis would mean that everywhere where we create a SQLA label we'd send it through a db_engine_spec `normalize_sqla_label` method. This also means that we need to also systematically do this every time we access a column in a dataframe.\r\n\r\nNow for the Druid connector there's no `db_engine_spec` as it's a SQLA construct. Maybe BaseViz can register a `self.normalize_label()` that points to `db_engine_spec.normalize_sqla_label` for the sqla connector, and points to a no-op for the druid connector.\r\n\r\nWhat do you

You know what they say about the proverbial frog in boiling water..\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that the currently identified problematic SQLA databases/connectors (Snowflake, Redshift, Oracle) share the following characteristics:\r\n- `cursor.description` returns all lowercase column names.\r\n- Executing a select via the cursor with lowercase column names (or mixed/upper case for that matter) results in upper case column labels in the query result.\r\n\r\nWhile it can't be excluded that some engine down the line will exhibit some other behaviour, I suspect having a normalizing function when creating a tables that uppercases column names when returned from a `cursor.description` should solve most of the observed problems. In addition, metrics would probably need to be passed through the same normalizer, but beyond that one might not need to do any further wrangling (famous last words).\r\n\r\nI think I'll give it a shot and see where I land.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414776077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414778273","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5686#issuecomment-414778273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5686","id":414778273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDc3ODI3Mw==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T18:36:38Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T18:36:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You can add BigQuery to the list.

Let me move this discussion into another SIP, so this one will be kept small and focus on the front-end chart code clean up. We aim that the first pass of this process is to decouple front-end side of these classic vis into packages and be able to use current APIs to power them (i.e. without modifying viz.py yet). Meanwhile there are other workstreams on defining the common query and data format for explore API v2 that can be used to power multiple visualizations and decide what are the post-transformations in js.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414829767/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/414848278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5680#issuecomment-414848278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5680","id":414848278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDg0ODI3OA==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T22:58:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T22:58:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch I agree with your comment\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure how to model the query vs dataframe operations, should it be incorporate into the query, or made into its own thing.

Ideally we'd create a superset Github org with all the repos with need, and all committers would be `admins`, thought that is not the apache way\r\n\r\nI think it's fairly easy to revisit this decision too. The question is if not under `apache/`, where? This may require a mailing list thread with our apache mentor Ashutosh. \r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n* create a superset GH org, move many of our smaller repos there, keep the main repo under apache, there we'd have full admin rights, no need to ask Apache infra for anything\r\n* all packages under the current repo\r\n* work with Apache infra at creating the many repos as we need them\r\n\r\nWe may be able to dig out Ashutosh's GH account and tag him here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/415594295/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/415594766","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5672#issuecomment-415594766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5672","id":415594766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTU5NDc2Ng==","user":{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T22:45:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T22:45:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hopefully we'll be deprecating these soon but also lgtm 👍 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/415594766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/415595211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/5496#issuecomment-415595211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/5496","id":415595211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTU5NTIxMQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T22:47:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T22:47:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is not directly related to this issue, but we're starting to recommend people use the Druid SQLAlchemy dialect and use that instead of the Druid connector.
