Storm puts any critical data into zookeeper to ensure the data can be available at any time (when ZK is not available Storm will not work anyway...) This would be no longer true if we store it to only local disk.</p>\n\n<p>You would want to think about the cases which each Nimbus has its own assignments (which is not in sync) stored to local (only one of them is leader though) and all of them are shutting down and restarting at the same time. Which Nimbus should be a leader? How we ensure the elected Nimbus has the latest assignments?</p>\n\n<p>Btw, the idea brings me some thoughts: one of Storm's great point is stateless which can be achieved with stable storage (ZK for Storm), and we claims that Supervisor can work even Nimbus goes down. Now we introduced Nimbus H/A which makes Nimbus not a SPOF, and so some components like Supervisor may be able to rely on leader Nimbus instead of communicating with ZK if it is much faster and it doesn't put too much load to the leader Nimbus. (And this approach looks like same as your approach on your idea.)</p>\n\n<p>And since we only allow leader Nimbus to handle assignments, while we still need to write assignments to ZK, we can 'cache' it within leader Nimbus (and update cache if there's any change on assignments: note that we should also write to ZK earlier though) and avoid reading it from ZK. <br/>\nWe still need to get heartbeat (and statistics) from ZK, but it will be handled as similar idea or another approach (like Metrics V2 in point of metrics' view)</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613032305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/328530393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2319#issuecomment-328530393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2319","id":328530393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODUzMDM5Mw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-11T13:33:58Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T13:33:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danny0405 conceptually this is a wonderful improvement.

I think you are right that it's because partition reassignment is happening at a bad time. I think we should move reassignment to be the first thing in nextTuple instead. Give me a little bit to fix this and maybe add a test.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking a bit about partition revocation and shuffling, and we might want to add some warnings to the manual partition assignment API as well. There are a few cases I can think of where shuffling partitions can cause bugs. The Trident spout doesn't support partition shuffling because Trident doesn't expect partitions to move from task to task, as far as I can tell. When we implement at-most-once support for this spout there's also a requirement that partitions don't move between tasks, since otherwise it is possible that tuples are emitted more than once.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/329254323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613003010","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6276#issuecomment-2613003010","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6276","id":2613003010,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwMDMwMTA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-13T19:09:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:05:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
