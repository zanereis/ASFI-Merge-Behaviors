So it checks how many are enabled, tells the PG to enable all, then checks how many are enabled, and basically when the # of enabled services stops changing then it means no more could be enabled, but the enable command isn't providing any response because it is an asynchronous command and doesn't know what was/wasn't enabled.\r\n\r\nSo for #2 we don't really know which CS couldn't be enabled, we just know no more were enabled. Maybe when it finishes we can list the validation errors for all of the invalid services.\r\n\r\nFor #5, the looping is something that can happen whenever any controller service gets stuck in the \"enabling\" state which can happen if it gets a stuck thread or an error. Right now it loops 120 times sleeping 1 second and then would break out and throw an error. This is obviously too long, but it is hard to say how long to wait, maybe 30 seconds?\r\n\r\nFor disabling, it just fires off a call to a REST end point and tells a PG to disable all it's services. I can see if we can make additional calls to get the count before and after and give some info.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind, all of the above info is only going to print in interactive mode. From standalone mode nothing is currently printed because I don't know if anything makes sense for someone writing a script.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/378409461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/378459860","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2562#issuecomment-378459860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2562","id":378459860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODQ1OTg2MA==","user":{"login":"mans2singh","id":8467404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0Njc0MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8467404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh","html_url":"https://github.com/mans2singh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mans2singh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T02:26:19Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T02:26:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@MikeThomsen - \r\n\r\nI have updated the test cases regarding usage of assertions.

I'd imagine users writing scripts redirecting the standard output to log files or using tools like Jenkins/Travis that already give you access to the standard output. If the script fails it would be useful to see what happened. Also, but I think it has already been mentioned in the previous PR for the CLI, having an exit code not equal to 0 could be useful to fail fast.\r\n\r\nTest 2:\r\n````\r\n$ ./cli.sh nifi pg-enable-services -pgid 016210c2-759f-1d4a-c230-abfde87350cf -u http://localhost:8080\r\n$ echo $?\r\n0\r\n````","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/378548020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/378655040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2587#issuecomment-378655040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2587","id":378655040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODY1NTA0MA==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-04T16:05:30Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T16:05:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey @JohannesDaniel - just made new tests and can't reproduce what I saw previously... so let's forget about it :) (thanks for the unit tests though!)\r\n\r\nI tested the EL support for tag validation, working well, thanks for the addition. I'd just make one suggestion: right now for the record tag, \"in the case of a mismatch, the respective record will be skipped\". I'd suggest to make this behavior configurable through a parameter in the CS: skip the record (current behavior) or throw an exception for the flow file (as you're doing for the root tag validation).\r\n\r\nRegarding the performance test, it was a GFF => ConvertRecord (XML to JSON) => UpdateAttribute.
