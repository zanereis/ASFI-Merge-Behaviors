currently provide a global `-i` flag for the CLI. We use this flag for all tests and local development because we don't have a trusted certificate installed for local deployment. We can entertain this idea with `letsencrypt` but I'm not sure it's worth the effort (plus they require renewal every 90 days, so more processes).\r\n\r\nSo that means for local development either every CLI command you enter must have `-i` or you have to create an alias `wsk=wsk -i`.\r\n\r\nWhat the PR does is allow up to configure the CLI and store the setting in `.wskprops`.\r\n\r\nYour concern is that one might use the insecure ssl setting with a trusted domain and that's undesirable. But it's no worse that the alias.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily for local developers and those who have more than one deployment that they work with. I tend to switch between deployments via `WSK_CONFIG_FILE` changes which point to different `.wskprops`. So each would have it's own setting, including insecure ssl (which is off by default).\r\n\r\nSo what to do about the case where someone sets `-i` in their property file and forgets and now is using the same property file with a trusted domain? Generating a warning on every CLI command is a non-starter. So if we wanted to be cautious about it, one thought is for the CLI to issue a warning when changing `apihost` or `authkey`.

reason not to use different aliases and why it breaks down: if you're working with deployment scripts with others, who use `wsk`, then it breaks. Every app deployment scripts that I've had to work with from others did this, and I've had to change their scripts to use `$WSK` where I can override it from the command line for example. So I've opted for always using `wsk` for convenience and just toggling the `WSK_CONFIG_FILE` through a similar mechanism.\r\n\r\nUsually others are working against a production environment (Bluemix) but I'm using a private deployment.
