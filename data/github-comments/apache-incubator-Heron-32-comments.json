yeah that's the problem. The statemanager config loading is not in the shape I'd like it to be. The issue is that the python state managers take configs in a different format than the java state managers and we have configs for the latter so we need to read them and convert to the former.\n\nWe can't just read the configs directly, because the java impl has wildcard parsing logic not present in the python impl. For example, for the local statemanager the config is this:\n\n```\n$ grep heron.statemgr.root.path ~/.heron/conf/local/statemgr.yaml\nheron.statemgr.root.path:                       ${HOME}/.herondata/repository/state/${CLUSTER}\n```\n\nwhere `${CLUSTER}` and `${HOME}` are not handled. What we need is a python implementation of https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/spi/src/java/com/twitter/heron/spi/common/Misc.java#L142\n\nAnyone know if there's anything similar in

Many times YARN application is headless and there is no home directory for the user. Also it is possible the user launching the topology is different from the executor's user. In my test case, YARN set the home as /home. I can thinking of fixing the issue by updating the YARN configuration for now. But I am not sure if resolving the path on the executor is a good idea. What do you think about constructing the state manager directory location on the client and let all components use the same? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/245969367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/245980166","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1343#issuecomment-245980166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1343","id":245980166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTk4MDE2Ng==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-09T17:22:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T17:22:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The `${HOME}` wildcard token is supported and used extensively by Heron in the java classes, as most files under https://github.com/twitter/heron/blob/master/heron/config/src/yaml/conf show.
