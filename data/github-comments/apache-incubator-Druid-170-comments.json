primitive value instead of Object. For the selectors to be used as ObjectSelectors the user should call getObject() which returns a Nullable object.\r\n\r\nNow for the MapVirtualColumnValueSelector case that you pointed out, modified isNull() method to return always false, since it is not supposed to used as a Long/Float/Double column selector.
