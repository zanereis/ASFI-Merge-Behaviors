The assignment seems redundant to me, as `Requests` does the job of translating it.\r\n\r\n[Line 244 of libcloud/http.py](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/72de440a508fdb4ea546d4e586a452472f1cbd5d/libcloud/http.py#L244) **(LibcloudConnection class)**\r\n```\r\ndef prepared_request(self, method, url, body=None,\r\n                     headers=None, raw=False, stream=False):\r\n    headers = self._normalize_headers(headers=headers)\r\n\r\n    req = requests.Request(method, ''.join([self.host, url]),\r\n                           data=body, headers=headers)\r\n\r\n    prepped = self.session.prepare_request(req)\r\n\r\n    prepped.body = body  # <<<<<< This line.\r\n\r\n    self.response = self.session.send(\r\n        prepped,\r\n        stream=stream,\r\n        verify=self.ca_cert if self.ca_cert is not None else self.verify)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why it's the Problem\r\n\r\nWhen a request is prepared, if its body is an empty string `''`, the preparation step ignores the body and sets the resulting `PreparedRequest` body to `None`. Subsequently setting the body back to an empty string `''` breaks requests logic when sending the request. `Requests` now thinks the request should be chunked because `body=''` breaks this logic:\r\n\r\n[Line 420 of requests/adapters.py](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L420)\r\n```\r\nchunked = not (request.body is None or 'Content-Length' in request.headers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA raw HTTP chunked request is sent with no body. As a result only a `0` is transmitted to signify the last chunk. This coincides with when our server receives the HTTP 400 error. \r\n\r\n[Line 469 of requests/adapters.py](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L469)\r\n```\r\nfor i in request.body:\r\n    low_conn.send(hex(len(i))[2:].encode('utf-8'))\r\n    low_conn.send(b'\\r\\n')\r\n    low_conn.send(i)\r\n    low_conn.send(b'\\r\\n')\r\nlow_conn.send(b'0\\r\\n\\r\\n')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Issue Appears when Default Value is `''`\r\nThis problem originates from the default value for the `data` parameter within a provider's connection class `request` method.  Some connection classes set the default value for data as `None` instead of `''`, and `None` does not trigger this issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#libcloud/common/openstack.py OpenStackBaseConnection\r\ndef request(self, action, params=None, data='', headers=None, ...)\r\n\r\n#libcloud/common/base.py Connection\r\ndef request(self, action, params=None, data=None, headers=None, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Replicating the Behavior\r\nYou can use this snippet to reproduce the same behavior outside the context of Libcloud.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\nsession = requests.Session()\r\n\r\nreq = requests.Request('GET', 'http://www.google.com', data='')\r\n\r\n# prepare_request() will ignore the empty string and set prepped.body to None.\r\nprepped = session.prepare_request(req)\r\n\r\n# Overwriting None with '' will break requests logic for sending requests.\r\nprepped.body = ''\r\n\r\n# Chunked request is sent with a zero length body. Only terminating 0 is sent. \r\nresponse = session.send(prepped, stream=False, verify=False)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/689757521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/696017114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1490#issuecomment-696017114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1490","id":696017114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjAxNzExNA==","user":{"login":"Aikoh0","id":61695944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjk1OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61695944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0","html_url":"https://github.com/Aikoh0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aikoh0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T09:59:22Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T09:59:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello
