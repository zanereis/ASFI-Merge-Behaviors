I think it's more that this jar is a necessary resource for this test to execute, and that such a resource should be built during the build steps.

You'll get some conflicting opinions about whether or not code-cleanup on the side should be included in a ticket that isn't explicitly addressing code-cleanup, but I personally try to limit it to files I'm touching anyway.  If you've found that your cleanup has spread out in scope, open a PR just for that.\r\n\r\nThe reason being here that it is now more difficult for me to review this PR, having to scroll through many low-impact improvements to find the actual scope of the ticket that is meaningfully distinct.\r\n\r\nYou'll also get conflicting opinions on this front as well, but I think it also helps to keep these sorts of things as separate commits that are squashed before merging, especially now that we have that nice `Squash and merge` button.  That way, I can sift out the low-impact commits like `prefer assertThat().isNull() over assertNotNull`, and have the actual bulk of the PR in a commit like `Have StarterRules use Launcher classes` available at my fingertips.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/429927346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/429956483","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/2601#issuecomment-429956483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/2601","id":429956483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTk1NjQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"jinmeiliao","id":15638418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM4NDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15638418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao","html_url":"https://github.com/jinmeiliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinmeiliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T18:08:53Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T18:08:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"looks like you are doing two things at once. one is to increase the timeout, which should be a one line change.

This way the rules are using the User API directly.\r\n\r\nI agree with the statement above, we won't be testing the Launchers all over again, but us them as any user would instead.
