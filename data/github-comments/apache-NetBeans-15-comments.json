Aren't the tests executed on this environment?\r\n\r\nTravis does a full build - including tests. Even before the migration to apache not all unittests of the code base were excercised before a tree merge. Some of the unittests are currently broken and other just plain take much to long to run on each build. It is always a good idea to check the unittests of packages, you know that are affected by your change explicitly.\r\n\r\n> _Analysis Result:_ The problem lies in the switch from bundle versioning to package versioning, which was not correctly mapped in the jsch case and is missing in slf4.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a good route to take.

Imo fixing them should probably occur once after a strict checkstyle and PMD setup is put in place which either NetBeans specialists can configure with the current build system or anyone after migrating to Maven (in case there're any plans).

The reason is that there exist modules on the legacy update centers that are newer that the modules in the repository, and if we just incremented +0.1 (in release90) and +1 (in master), there would be legacy/old modules with the same spec. versions as our current modules. The intent is that 7f2fee14d01d34e91489ef0d09e6e97eaef416d3 would be merged to master as well, and then the spec versions. would be incremented again.

The second is to cd to the dir with the actual script. The third one cd's to the result of `pwd -P`, which makes the current path absolute and resolves all symlinks. That last one is done in the main script, but I felt it might be better to do that using `pwd` than to use the logic in the main executable since that is mostly what `pwd` is for.\r\n\r\nAlso, to test this, you will need to make a Netbeans Platform app, build it with \"build-mac\", and then sign the result with `codesign`.
