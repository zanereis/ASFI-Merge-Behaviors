In the literature, 'same', 'valid' and 'full' have precise meanings for pooling and convolutions:\n- same: the tensor is padded so that the input and output tensors are the same width and height. \n- valid: no padding\n\nThis is used by [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/nn.html#convolution) or [Numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.convolve.html), for example. Using these names for this will cause confusion (esp. if MXnet decided to add these very useful options for convolution + pooling).\n\nOne option: have a \"caffe_compatibility\" (bool) option. \n\nHere is a question that we should answer first: what is the actual computational difference in the pooling layer? Is the MXNet pooling layer equivalent to Caffe with some extra padding for certain input dimensions?
