Markus Weimer posted a proposal to general@incubator.apache.org seeking for ideas and suggestions. The official voting is ongoing on general@ right now.\r\n\r\n# Features and Improvements\r\n## Operator Support\r\n* A special operator `annotation.stop_fusion` to prevent it being fused with previous expressions (#2624).\r\n* `batch_matmul`  supported ([#2561](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2561)).\r\n* `reverse_reshape` supported ([#2503](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2503)).\r\n* Faster-RCNN proposal operator for CUDA ([#2420](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2420)).\r\n* Vision operator for YOLO `yolo_reorg` ([#1941](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/1941)).\r\n* `slice` operator for MXNet ([#2662](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2662)).\r\n* `arange` supported ([#2621](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2621)).\r\n* Vision operator `roi_align` ([#2618](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2618)).\r\n* `where` operator for MXNet ([#2647](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2647)).\r\n\r\n## User Interface and Frontend\r\n* Introduced `HybridModule` ([#2477](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2477)) so that normal TVM schedule can be compiled to hybrid target, run and dumped to Hybrid Script.\r\n* Most frameworks have been supported in Relay, including ONNX, Keras, Tensorflow, Caffe2, CoreML, NNVMv1, MXNet ([#2246](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2246)). Siju is working on DarkNet.\r\n* Relay now supports saving and loading parameter dictionaries. ([#2620](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2620))\r\n* Rust frontend ([#2292](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2292)).\r\n* We are now supporting Tensorflow saved model for NNVM ([#2493](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2493/)). Relay support is ongoing ([#2586](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2586/)).\r\n* Add `max_num_threads`  to Hybrid Script, which allows users to get max number of threads for GPU targets ([#2672](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2672/)).\r\n\r\n## Runtime and Hardware Support\r\n* RFC for bringing TVM to Bare-Metal devices ([#2563](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2563))\r\n* Make external library extend TVM's NDArray more easily ([#2613](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2613)).\r\n\r\n## Performance Improvement\r\n* AlterOpLayout pass is now enabled for x86 on Relay ([#2585](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2585)). It is essential to get decent performance for CNN-based model on Intel CPUs.\r\n\r\n## Documents and Tutorials\r\n* Tutorials for deep learning frameworks support in Relay.\r\n* Tutorial for running AutoTVM with Relay ([#2594](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2594)).\r\n* Document for Algebraic Data Types ([#2575](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2575)).\r\n\r\n##  High-level Optimizations\r\n* An optimization pass to eliminate expressions which have the same functionality and same inputs ([#2639](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2639)).\r\n* Provided a pass to calculate the number of multiply-accumulate operations in a network ([#2609](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2609)).\r\n* Algebraic Data Types (ADT) support ([#2442](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2442), [#2575](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2575)). ADT provides an expressive, efficient, and safe way to realize recursive computation (e.g., RNN). Refer to https://docs.tvm.ai/langref/relay_adt.html for more information.\r\n* As a part of Relay's automatic differentiation system, we are adding primal gradients for Relay operators. Please refer to [#2562](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2562) for tracking the progress. (**Help wanted**). For automatic differentiation in Relay, also see [Automatic differentiation for tensor expressions](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2498), [Higher order reverse mode automatic differentiation that work with control flow](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2496), [Tensor Expression level automatic differentiation](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/1996)\r\n* Low-bit quantization supported ([#2116](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2116)). The workflow includes annotation, calibration and transformation. Please also see [Data-Aware Calibration](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2651) for calibration algorithm improvement (**Help wanted**). \r\n\r\n## Tensor Expression \r\n* RFC for formalizing Integer Arithmetic Analysis ([#2588](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2588)). It is aiming to perform better context-dependent analysis, bound analysis, centralized arithmetic logic and arithmetic simplification. \r\n\r\n# Contribution and Commits\r\nThanks Wei @wweic or

However, we prefer using a unified-formatted code which will be easier to change and maintain over time. We prefer having python API as base and call python functions from C++.\r\n\r\nFor calling python functions from C++, we would like to use methods provided by the C-API (http://docs.python.org/c-api/). This is especially the case for libraries that support so-called “callback” functions. The Python program must pass the Python function object, PyObject. By using PyObject as the basic object for the C-API, we would be able to represent any kind of python basic types (string, float, int,...).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***Clean Place for Error Handling APIs***\r\n\r\nWe would like to create a new folder, names err_handling, under python/tvm. Inside this folder, there would be four files (error types in same layer will be placed in one file): FrameworkParsing_Err.py, Pass_Err.py, CompSche_Err.py, runtune_Err.py.\r\n\r\n**Example 1: inside FrameworkParsing_Err.py**\r\n```\r\ndef _raise_attr_required_error (attr, op):\r\nraise AttributeError(\"OperatorAttributeRequired: Required attribute {} is not found in operator {}.\".format(attr,op))\r\ndef _raise_attr_value_error(error, op):\r\nraise AttributeError(\"OperatorAttributeValueNotValid: Value {} in attr {} is not valid in operator {}\".format(value, attr, op_name)\r\ndef _raise_attr_not_supported_error(attr, op):\r\nraise NotImplementedError(\"OperatorAttributeNotImplemented: {} is not supported in {}\".format(attr, op))\r\ndef _raise_op_not_supported_error(missing_op):\r\nraise NotImplementedError(\"OperatorNotImplemented: The following operators are not implemented: {}\".format(missing_op))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to use framework parsing error APIs, we could import FrameworkParsing_Err in the beginning of the mxnet.py, tensorflow.py, etc under frontend folder and use the defined error type function for throwing the error messages.\r\n\r\n**Example 2: inside Pass_Err.py**\r\n```\r\ndef _raise_infer_pass_error(c_error_msg, pass_name, op_name):\r\n      raise RuntimeError(\"RelayInferPassError: Insufficient/Invalid information\\\r\n      for {} pass for {} op failed with this {}\".format(pass_name, op_name, c_error_msg))\r\ndef _raise_pass_order_violated(pass_A, pass_B):\r\n      raise RuntimeError(\"RelayPassOrderViolated: {} pass need to be run before {} pass\".format(pass_A, pass_B))\r\ndef _raise_optimization_pass_error(pass_name):\r\n    raise RuntimeError(\"RelayOptimizationPassError: {} pass failed\".format(pass_name))\r\ndef _raise_graph_lowering_error(op_name):\r\n    raise RuntimeError(\"RelayGraphLoweringError: Lowering of {} op failed\".format(op_name))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/468991517/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/468991593","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2279#issuecomment-468991593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2279","id":468991593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODk5MTU5Mw==","user":{"login":"JennyChou5","id":39837160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODM3MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39837160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5","html_url":"https://github.com/JennyChou5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JennyChou5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-03T05:48:41Z","updated_at":"2019-03-03T05:48:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@tqchen @yidawang  Could you provide feedback?
