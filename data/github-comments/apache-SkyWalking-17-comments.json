I think TPS and average response time should be calculate. We calculate total calls and total error calls instead of TPS, because we can get TPS and error rate from total calls divide duration. We calculate baseline for application and method which TPS is more than fifty, because assuming high TPS applications are important. Also users can specify some app or method to calculate.  We do not calculate instance baseline because every instance should have same load\r\n  2. At the beginning, duration is every four seconds and minute. As the number of application and method have grown dramatically, I found that program can not cover enough method because of leak IO resource, so only minutely baseline is calculated. Four seconds baseline will be simulated by minutely baseline.\r\n  3. Baseline would never be recalculated except miscalculation or data loss.

问题1\r\nagent.jar包有16mb多，主要是org.skywalking.apm.dependencies这个目录下面的文件很大，请问下这个目录中将第三方的class的package都被加上了 “org.skywalking.apm.dependencies” 前缀，主要作用是什么？\r\n\r\norg.skywalking.apm.dependencies是为了保证探针依赖的完全独立性，避免和应用程序依赖树冲突。\r\n\r\n> 问题2\r\n因为agent的文件，是被分成3个目录（目录中包含多个jar包或者配置文件）+ skywalking-agent.jar 这个文件，现在想用这个来部署到服务器是非常痛苦的（生产实例太多），想做成一个flat jar（类似spring boot jar包），这样项目中直接依赖即可，升级和发布都会很方便，能否考虑下？\r\n\r\n你说的fat jar，老版本的探针很早就支持，但是这并不给你带来你理想中的方便。因为探针有Plugin可能和应用冲突，需要移除；你可能开发非开源的plugin，此时打包会困难；配置文件无法防止和方便修改。生产实例的部署，我们一般建议采用shell完成安装脚本，进行自动化安装和拷贝。\r\n\r\n> 问题3\r\n能否多点架构设计的文档，便于快速了解整个项目，进行二次开发，谢谢。\r\n\r\n开源项目的快速迭代，我们一般保持接口稳定，而非架构代码的绝对稳定，所以，暂时无法以稳定文档的方式提供。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/347880119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/347893650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/627#issuecomment-347893650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/627","id":347893650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Nzg5MzY1MA==","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-29T15:23:17Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T15:23:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage
