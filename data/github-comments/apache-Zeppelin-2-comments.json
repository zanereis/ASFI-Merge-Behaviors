It uses its own plug-in even if there is a system wide one available, although you might want to check with the Chrome folks about that.

And why do make the profile of Hadoop 2.6 even though there is no difference between Hadoop 2.4 and one of 2.6? Are you sure that Hadoop 2.4 depends on Jackson 1.8.8?

Look at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/pom.xml#L1620-L1631. the profile hadoop-2.4 of Spark supports that jackson.version is 1.9.13. As I've told you, I've tested this jackson library 1.8.8 and 1.9.13 with parsing json of spark 1.2.0, 1.2.1 and 1.3.0 with hadoop 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.3.0-cdh5.0.1, 2.5.0-cdh5.3.0 and 2.5.0-cdh5.3.1 in production level. It works fine with hive and hive on spark. In fact, the version of jackson version is less important, more important thing is fixing same version among jackson-core-asl, jackson-mapper-asl, jackson-xc and jackson-jaxrs. You can find theses in https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/pom.xml#L934-L955. Finally, I think adding fixing jackson library 1.9.13 is enough to support hadoop-2.6. And concerning (secure) Hadoop cluster, I've not tested it but It's Ok because I believe Spark already is being tested. From now, Zeppelin uses Hadoop from Spark, actually. If you found serious problem while using Hadoop, feel free to talk to me. I've known you patched for hiveInterpreter. Is there any problem to use hiveInterpreter with this jackson version?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/91746744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/91747685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/31#issuecomment-91747685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/31","id":91747685,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxNzQ3Njg1","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-11T02:57:41Z","updated_at":"2015-04-11T02:57:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Leemoonsoo @swkimme @RamVenkatesh and I discuss with adding a new profile for hadoop 2.6.

Without this change, our Zeppelin installation is completely broken - am upping the priority of this bug to blocker to expedite resolution.\n2. Even though the Spark project built against Hadoop 2.4, Spark 1.2.1 + Hadoop 2.6 is a valid tested configuration in some Spark distros, HDP for example. And this is optional, so people who want the stock Spark experience can specify the 2.4 profile.\n3. Hadoop 2.4 and Hadoop 2.6 are not identical, there are a number of fixes in 2.6 that we will need and independent of this discussion we will need a way to build with Hadoop 2.6. Modifying the 2.4 profile to specify 2.6 does not seem the best option to me. \n\nIMO everything we can do to help with adoption out of the box should be our priority now.\n\nTo address the maintenance concern, may I suggest we add a Hadoop 2.6 profile now, which can be removed when the community agrees it is no longer of use?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/92158417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/92340831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/27#issuecomment-92340831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/27","id":92340831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMzQwODMx","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-13T12:49:11Z","updated_at":"2015-04-13T12:49:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@goi

I've updated this as follows.\n- Added this to ZeppelinConfiguration for default configuration.\n- Updated Tajo builder order because it had caused a problem to ProtocolBuffer dependency.\n- Updated ZeppelinRestApiTest::getAvailableInterpreters\n\nAnd if you authorize me to assign JIRA issue, it would be better for me to contribute Zeppelin continuously.\n\nCheers\nJaehwa

Please rebase this branch with master branch.\n\nOne concern is  \nCurrently zeppelin-daemon process and interpreter process uses common.sh to construct it's classpath.\nOnce zeppelin-daemon have HDFS dependencies, then by common.sh, it'll be also loaded into every interpreter process. Especially spark include HDFS related dependency, too, they'll conflict.\n\nAnd version of HDFS related dependency's is fixed. i think it'll be better if it is configurable.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/97295608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/97302983","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/53#issuecomment-97302983","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/53","id":97302983,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3MzAyOTgz","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T04:46:21Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T04:46:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @hayssams, Thanks for contribution.
