This was pretty easy but required a little refactoring to allow my ReportingTask to share code with AbstractElasticsearchProcessor and PutElasticSearch.\n\nThis has lead me to wonder if it would make more sense to factor out an ElasticSearch ControllerService that could be shared between the Put/Fetch processors and other future components, such as ReportingTasks. This is similar to how JDBC settings are provided to ExecuteSQL via the DBCPConnectionPool. It _might_ even  allow a drop in replacement that uses the HTTP client rather than the Transport client, although it would probably require some thought on how to abstract out the underlying.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI guess if you were going to move to a ControllerService you might want to do it before the code gets merged into master to avoid a breaking change to the
