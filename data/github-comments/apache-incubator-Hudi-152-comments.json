(Like some indicators showed us on SparkUI), but, in some ways this parameters were affecting in a negative way the Glue native memory management.\r\n\r\nBasically, removing all the manual memory settings (like memory and memory overhead) on our glue spark context made the jobs running properly without any memory issues.

we think about removing the `hbase-server` from the `hudi-common` module? It's a big dependency. some ideas e.g. copy the HFile related source code or move relevant features into a non-core module or shaded it thoroughly into a third-party module like [this](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-hive-apache).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/916205449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/916206496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3623#issuecomment-916206496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3623","id":916206496,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42nDOg","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-09T15:31:17Z","updated_at":"2021-09-09T15:31:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhangyue19921010 IMO, it's not a minor change.

IIUC, I think there are still possible race conditions between when replacecommit.rejected file is created and when clustering validation check is performed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my high level thought is that it is better to find a way to integrate this with Multi-writer conflict resolution mentioned here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+22+%3A+Snapshot+Isolation+using+Optimistic+Concurrency+Control+for+multi-writers#RFC22:SnapshotIsolationusingOptimisticConcurrencyControlformultiwriters-OptimisticConcurrencyusingatomicrenameswithConflictResolution  \r\n\r\nIf we integrate with multi-writer, this can be done in a generic for any two operations (instead of adding very specific strategy for clustering.) Some changes may be needed in multi-writer implementation to enforce priority of operations (clustering is lower priority than ingestion). But this is better long term IMO.  Happy to discuss more details/other alternatives.

Ensure you set the right value for [avg record size config](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#hoodiecopyonwriterecordsizeestimate) . for subsequent operations, hudi will infer the record size from older commits. But for first commit (bulk import/bulk_insert), hudi relies on this config to pack records to right sized files. \r\n\r\nCouple of questions before we dive into perf in detail: \r\n1. may I know whats your upsert characteristics? Is it spread across all partitions, or just very few recent partitions. \r\n2. Does your record key have any timestamp affinity or characteristics. If record keys are completely random, we can try SIMPLE index, since bloom may not be very effective for completely random keys. \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/917429823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/917431256","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3418#issuecomment-917431256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3418","id":917431256,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42ruPY","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-11T16:07:16Z","updated_at":"2021-09-11T16:07:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If you wish to dedup with bulk_insert, we also need to set \"hoodie.combine.before.insert\" to true. \r\nJust to clarify, bulk_insert will not looking into any records in storage at all. so setting this config, will ensure incoming batch is deduped and written to hudi. \r\nIn other words, if you do 2 bulk_inserts, one followed by another, each batch will write unique records to hudi, but if there are records overlapping between batch 1 and batch2, bulk_insert may not update it. \r\n\r\nhope that clarifies. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/917431256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/917431404","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3431#issuecomment-917431404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3431","id":917431404,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM42ruRs","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-11T16:08:13Z","updated_at":"2021-09-11T16:08:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"awesome, thnx for the update.
