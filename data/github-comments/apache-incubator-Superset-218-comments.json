Basically, I added a function to the `db_engine_specs` file that replaces the file extension with `@@@`.  Then I wrote another function in the `db_engine_specs` that removes it.  \r\n\r\nWhat was happening was that Superset was working great with Drill when it was querying a database, but if something had a file, the dot for the file extension would mess up the URLs.  \r\n\r\nMy approach works, however, there were two places that I couldn't figure out how to call the database specific function in `db_engine_specs` so I just added the string replacement in the code.   The two locations are:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/ce3f9c30a925330763b394903d1a16ce6a90a495/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/components/SouthPane.jsx#L107\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/ce3f9c30a925330763b394903d1a16ce6a90a495/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditorLeftBar.jsx#L64\r\n\r\nAs you can see, these are not python files.  I couldn't figure out how to insert the Python function to clean up the table name.  \r\n\r\nAnother approach which I tried but couldn't figure out was to add a function in db_engine_specs to do all the URL transformations.  \r\n\r\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated, as I'd really like to get this integrated into Superset.\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485015355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485025844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6610#issuecomment-485025844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6610","id":485025844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTAyNTg0NA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-19T22:08:15Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T06:20:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It looks like the culprit is here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/ce3f9c30a925330763b394903d1a16ce6a90a495/superset/assets/src/components/TableSelector.jsx#L173-L179\r\nThis seems to have been copied over from (now deprecated?) code that was introduced in a PR that's two years old: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/1466\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/5f28027ce745dfda67e18fe7df8468184400be50/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditorLeftBar.jsx#L86-L96\r\nIt seems the table selector is assuming that a table name with a period is schema.table, hence omitting everything before the period.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch do you have any idea or context on what's going on here? It seems like this functionality has been deprecated (choosing a table without having first chosen a schema), and the above logic should be removed. I tested creating a table with a period in the name on Postgres and got a similar error. Removing the `namePieces` logic fixed the problem and seems the appropriate

I solved the issue at my end: when I opened the target directory that pip was complaining about, found a stray `.fuse-hidden..` file that geany and maybe some other apps keeps conjuring in my folders (you press refresh and they're ususally gone). Seems this stray one was left over. I deleted it, and then the install/upgrade process ran smoothly. So do check out the actual folder at your end.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485322446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/485326390","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7131#issuecomment-485326390","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7131","id":485326390,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTMyNjM5MA==","user":{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-22T05:07:28Z","updated_at":"2019-04-22T05:07:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Hi @villebro , I left some comments inline.
