of all, in the theory, I am OK with this PR. You need to fix the following things.\r\n1. No English document. `docs/en/Specified-agent-config.md` is empty. Apache requires English document as default and only official document.\r\n1. I have concern about you are using `javaagent` argument(String) as the path only. This blocks other potential usage of this arguments. I want to discuss about, whether we could use `-D` or System.env to set the config file, instead of change this argument? The reason I proposed this is that, a) In traditional ways, SkyWalking already used these. b) These are easier to understand and fit Cloud Native (Docker based)\r\n\r\nI need sync the info with you that, I am going to do RC release at Monday, I need to freeze codes before that and do several release tests.

Agent begins its connect fail-safe mechanism, which will ignore all traces, until connection established again.\r\n\r\n> And is there some doc to describe the mechanism?\r\n\r\nIn 3.x, no.

Because the agent should ignore all traces. But maybe if you memory is not enough, the trace in buffer may cause full GC in some cases. \r\n\r\nAlso, if my remember is reliable, if 3 and 5-alpha/beta, if collector is not crash, but suspends by performance or others, this may cause leak.\r\n\r\n> And is there some doc to describe the mechanism, either?\r\n\r\nNo. That is detial thing, you need read codes to understand that part.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/416232788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/416233048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/1590#issuecomment-416233048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1590","id":416233048,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjIzMzA0OA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T13:50:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T13:50:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The fix should happen in 5.0.0-GA and also 6.0.0-alpha","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/416233048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/416410181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/1593#issuecomment-416410181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/1593","id":416410181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjQxMDE4MQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-28T00:21:30Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T00:21:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CI fails?

(It seems used long connection based on jetty).\r\nThen how about the efficiency between collector and es? What's about its mechanism? I mean, if the input   request rate from collector gt the process rate to es, what will happen? Is there exist disk cache or similar way to process? It seems not appropriate  to use memory to do this, data is too much.\r\n\r\nIn the product env of internet, this is very common: there will be 100+ micro-service instance, and the qps will be 20K total around, 1K qps at least in the high load instance, and it will increase of course in the future.\r\n\r\nAccording to the performance report, the 1K qps per instance, then we need assess the collector scale.\r\nIf these conditions are satisfied as below:\r\na.Trace data transport is based on tcp long connection.\r\nb.The package about trace is not large.\r\nc.Collector have mechanism to write trace data to es in the high efficiency.\r\nThen 10K qps per collector is very ok, I think.\r\nIs that mean, we need at least three collector nodes in the env that based on giving consideration to usability of collector cluster and request qps scale?\r\n\r\nAt last, I mean, is there some advice or default config about collector cluster scale based on the request scale above?
