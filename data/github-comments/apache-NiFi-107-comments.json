intended for JIRA to only describe the issue, not the solution (as I'd prefer not to steer anyone trying to solve that issue into a particular solution, there might be alternate approaches).\r\n\r\nThe issue at hand is that, when determining if a record is compatible with a given schema, we consider nullable fields to be compatible with null values. Generally, this makes sense, but not for union types. If one of the union choices is a record with only nullable fields, this choice suddenly becomes compatible with pretty much everything - like, you can feed it a record with completely unrelated field names, and it would still be considered compatible (see JIRA for an example).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to address that issue by keeping track of how many non-nullable fields were found compatible, as a ratio to the total # of fields checked. The ratio goes from -1 (not compatible) to 100 (fully compatible). So the above example would still be considered \"sorta-compatible\", with a rating of 0, but the compatibility check would still continue, and if a schema choice with a higher rating is found (all it takes for that is one non-nullable field to be found compatible), that schema would be used instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/465320099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/465353437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3321#issuecomment-465353437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3321","id":465353437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTM1MzQzNw==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T23:23:34Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T23:23:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, I'll try to get some time RSN to review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/465353437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/465356054","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3319#issuecomment-465356054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3319","id":465356054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTM1NjA1NA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-19T23:33:48Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T23:33:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merged.

It builds on some established design patterns for showing processor status and interactive conventions when stopping/terminating active threads.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this is straight forward referencing the attached mockup. This single image shows three dialog states, starting with Processor Details (left). This is as if the user double-clicked or selected 'view configuration' from a running processor's context menu. Here in the dialog there's a new section below the header that resembles the canvas's status bar. It's a familiar design, in a familiar location and it uses familiar icons along with the 'Run Status' labeling you'd see in the Summary table. The bulletin icon and styling is replicated as well. The new addition here is the 'stop & configure' action.\r\n\r\n![view-config-dialogs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14202495/53118471-286afc80-351b-11e9-8b70-5b5d883cf375.png)\r\nNote: I used a processor that has an 'Advanced' configuration button as well, as that is another thing competing for real estate in this space.\r\n\r\nThe second dialog (center) is as if the user clicked the 'stop & configure' action and is now in the 'Configure Processor' dialog with editable fields. The processor status has changed to 'stopped', but the active thread continues. In this waiting state, the user can make changes, but the 'Apply' button is disabled and will remain so until the active thread completes. However, there is now a 'terminate' action available. This aligns with the current interactive convention seen from a processor's context menu (first you stop the processor, then the action is replaced with terminate if threads are running).\r\n\r\nThe third dialog (right) would be as if a thread completed on its own, or the user clicked the 'terminate' action. Here you can see the 'Apply' button is available allowing the user to proceed and continue as normal.\r\n\r\nInterested in hearing your thoughts, along with @mcgilman 's as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/465720646/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/465752554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3281#issuecomment-465752554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3281","id":465752554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTc1MjU1NA==","user":{"login":"aeaversa","id":36886905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODg2OTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36886905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa","html_url":"https://github.com/aeaversa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeaversa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T21:01:56Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T21:01:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@moranr - Hey I really like this proposed change!

I see this is currently in a profile and I think that is okay for the common case, but do you think this would be a standard inclusion in our release process for NiFi such that the generated artifacts are readily available?\r\n\r\n@apiri The primary rationale is  that we will eventually be able to create regression tests in this or a related package to avoid making releases that could break this linkage ( Will always be an aspect of MiNiFi c++ that may require change with NiFi releases, but hoping this could be a mitigating mechanism \r\n -- and I only consider this as MiNiFi is part of the Apache NiFi). Secondarily, the hope is that this feature appears more official by being a release artifact of Apache NiFi proper ( this feeds back into the first point ). \r\n\r\nThe target could certainly live in C++, referencing the remote parent, without any issue whatsoever, but these two primary points were what I wanted to discuss. \r\n\r\nI would anticipate this breaking often without ownership in NiFi, and I know some profiles exist for various entities, so precedent seemed to exist in that aspect. Certainly open to discussion where we put this. My preference due to the risk to MiNiFi C++, and perceived less risk to NiFi is that if we don't put this here we don't put this in MINiFi C++ and instead provide it as documentation only -- or alternatively within a separate project altogether that does not tie this functionality to Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/466719781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/466724087","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3317#issuecomment-466724087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3317","id":466724087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjcyNDA4Nw==","user":{"login":"adamfisher","id":1834711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQ3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1834711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher","html_url":"https://github.com/adamfisher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamfisher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-24T01:25:35Z","updated_at":"2019-02-24T01:25:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> You will definitely need some unit tests for this before we could proceed with a real review.

Probably best to take this to the user list and hash out the use case to make sure that we cover the bases here. When I raised the issue, I think I neglected to mention that my team was working with UUIDv5 IDs for records, so that (and UUIDv3) need to be hashed out.\r\n\r\n@MikeThomsen if I am understanding your requirement, you have records containing UUIDs and wish to use them to determine uniqueness of your records. You should be able to assign a single user-defined property where the name is the record path of the field containing the UUID.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/466724087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/466779080","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3278#issuecomment-466779080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3278","id":466779080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Njc3OTA4MA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-24T13:51:17Z","updated_at":"2019-02-24T13:51:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bbende @ijokarumawak any chance of a review?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/466779080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/466779550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3266#issuecomment-466779550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3266","id":466779550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Njc3OTU1MA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-24T13:57:32Z","updated_at":"2019-02-24T13:57:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@AnthonyMastrean I think I have a way forward for you.

for the PR @rabits! I do agree that we should move toward allowing variables to be referenced from any property. This will make integration with the nifi registry easier and more versatile. However, I think we should go about it in a little bit different way. When a user enters a value for a property, I'd like to see a checkbox in the UI or some other mechanism in the UI to allow the user to indicate \"This is the name of a variable I want to reference\" versus \"This is the value of the property.\"\r\n\r\nThis approach has a lot of advantages. Firstly, it becomes very clear what the user's intent is. Secondly, it allows us to provide a nicer user experience around variables, such as auto-complete. It clarifies the possible ambiguity between variables and FlowFile Attributes. Additionally, it means that we can substitute in the variable value before performing validation so that validation is made more useful.\r\n\r\nIt also means that a sensitive property could reference a variable and we can be safe in providing the name of that variable to the flow registry when versioning a flow. However, we do need to support sensitive variables as well, in order for this to work cleanly. This would allow us to encrypt the sensitive variable at-rest and not provide it back in the UI, and we could enforce that a sensitive property only reference a sensitive variable.

I simply added the snap functionality to the most used components.  You're right about consistency.  I'll likely go back and change the remaining components.\r\n\r\nInteresting, re: flow versioning.  I had assumed that only the data flows were relevant in flow versioning.  Adding/removing processors, endpoints, etc...  \r\n\r\nIn testing and implementing this feature, I noticed that the canvas elements didn't move until I had moved them (thereby evoking the draggable event).  While their sizes certainly changed, their origin coordinates didn't shift on the canvas.  What's tracked in the flow versioning process?  I'd imagine that the only required position data would be a single x/y coordinate pair for each component.  You'd only really need the size information for things like labels, unless there's a way to resize components that I'm not aware of.  Is there any reason why this would be implemented differently in the versioning process?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/467270488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/467271663","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3335#issuecomment-467271663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3335","id":467271663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzI3MTY2Mw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-26T02:45:50Z","updated_at":"2019-02-26T02:45:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, the origin point is what is tracked, although that's because component size (other than labels) was static and unchanged since 1.0.0. With this change, component size may need to be tracked as well, or there could be inconsistencies introduced when a flow from one version is imported into an instance running a different version. \r\n\r\nIt's interesting that the \"snap\" doesn't occur until a drag event is registered on the component. Does this happen for all components in a selection/snippet if you select multiple and move them that way? I can see pros and cons to this -- an existing flow will not change the origin points until manually changed, but at the same time, if you have 1000's of components on a canvas, having to \"snap\" them individually/in groups. If a process group is moved, do the components contained inside that process group have their location modified as well?\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of a coding on a feature branch, so I can't check out this PR right now to explore on my own.

Thanks for the PR! It is a very concise solution to the problem at hand. I share some of the share concerns that have been mentioned thus far and I have a few suggestions for addressing them.\r\n\r\n**Turning this feature on/off**\r\nRather than always using snap-to-grid or adding a property which would set it for the entire instance what are your thoughts about conditionally snapping based on whether the drag event contains some modifier key (like Drag-Shift or something)? We could even discuss further with others in the community if the modifier key activated the snap functionality or if snap was the default and the modifier activated the more granular placement. If we took an approach like this we could even apply the same logic when resizing a label to ensure it's dimensions are a factor of `snapAlignmentPixels`. For consistency, I would also probably apply the same logic to connection bend point movement.\r\n\r\n**Component dimensions**\r\nMy hesitations with the component dimensions are slightly different. The design/layout of each canvas node have been thoroughly considered/implemented to ensure they are pixel perfect. If we modify the dimensions of them it would probably warrant reconsidering each. Also, there would be another concern that could affect flow layout. As the dimensions change, the spacing between the nodes in existing flows also change and may require manually adjusting the layout. In extreme cases (either large changes to the dimensions or tightly laid-out flows), nodes could even overlap. This is admittedly not super concerning in this PR because the dimension changes here are so minimal. But it's still something we are super conscious of and generally avoid. However, I can appreciate the solution here by having the dimensions be a factor of `snapAlignmentPixels` we can align against all four sides of the node. Clever :)\r\n\r\n@moranr Can you pull down this PR and evaluate each of the affected components to see if the change in dimensions would necessitate adjusting any of their contents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468034211/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468091492","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3326#issuecomment-468091492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3326","id":468091492,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODA5MTQ5Mg==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T00:51:55Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T00:51:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MikeThomsen Will scope it out","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468091492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/468096438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3326#issuecomment-468096438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3326","id":468096438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODA5NjQzOA==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T01:15:55Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T01:15:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good here!

Does this happen for all components in a selection/snippet if you select multiple and move them that way? I can see pros and cons to this -- an existing flow will not change the origin points until manually changed, but at the same time, if you have 1000's of components on a canvas, having to \"snap\" them individually/in groups. \r\n\r\nHaving just tested this, I can confirm that each component does snap and align individually when multiple are selected and moved together.  Let me know if you want to see the recording that I took. \r\n\r\n> If a process group is moved, do the components contained inside that process group have their location modified as well?\r\n\r\nSince the draggable event only impacts the selected canvas element(s), the inner processors for a process group shouldn't be moved.  I believe that draggable states are only invoked on components selected in the current canvas \"level\", and not on nested components, but I haven't verified this.\r\n\r\n> **Turning this feature on/off**\r\n> Rather than always using snap-to-grid or adding a property which would set it for the entire instance what are your thoughts about conditionally snapping based on whether the drag event contains some modifier key (like Drag-Shift or something)? \r\n\r\nThis seems like the best compromise.  Current users would still be able to move components around as they do now, but snap alignment would also be an option.  I'm unfamiliar with how nifi handles modifier keys.  Since all of the controlling logic for draggable events is in nf-draggable, how would I go about accessing the activated keys?  I've merely scratched the service of nifi's frontend and would appreciate some additional direction/tips!
