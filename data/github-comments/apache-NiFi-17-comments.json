The Kinesis libraries are licensed under the [Amazon Software License](https://aws.amazon.com/asl/).  This does not appear on the published [list of Apache-compatible licenses](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a).\n\nThe Apache Spark project includes comparable use of the Kinesis library, although they have chosen to [present their Kinesis integration as an optional add-on](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-kinesis-integration.html).  Comparable code is in fact [checked into the Spark repo](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/external), but I did not find mention of the Amazon Software License in a NOTICE file. I was really hoping to copy and paste.  I found a [JIRA issue raised by the Spark team for the license discussion](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-198) which discusses the add-on nature of the component, but not specific referencing language.\n\nIs this OK?

Concerning the extension of VariableRegistryProvider by the ControllerServiceLookup, it came from the need to populate the VariableRegistry from NiFiProperties, if available, (which was provided by implementations of ControllerServiceLookup, including FlowController, WebClusterManager) and provide it to StatePropertyValue (which received a ControllerServiceLookup object in it's constructor). I thought about having a third variable in the constructor for StatePropertyValue for the variableRegistry however when attempting to implement I needed to interrogate the ControllerServiceLookup  anyway in many cases. I definitely understand the weirdness which is why a the least I had it extend the interface as opposed to adding the getVariableRegistry method to that interface directly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/224857442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/224896514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/509#issuecomment-224896514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/509","id":224896514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDg5NjUxNA==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T13:36:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T13:36:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 looks good, will merge to 0.x...

This means that someone could implement an hbase-client-service for another version of hbase, such as 0.94 and the processors don't have to change at all. I think adding this dependency here would make that not possible because a specific version of hbase-client would now be bundled with the processors.\n\nSeems like the reason for the dependency was to use the Bytes class that provides the conversion, which makes total sense.

I haven't looked into MapRs licensing for the dependent libraries we need here but if it is compatible with the proper ASF/ASLv2 licensing then great.  If not then it should not be included even as a profile.  Technically speaking we do not official release binary builds at all.  We do provide them as a convenience and we do have to ensure even those binary builds have full valid licensing.

So hypothetically speaking I suspect we could even go to the extreme lengths of releasing binaries linking to non ASL code as long the foreign code licenses are respected (e.g. ASL software does not exclude GPL licensed code, it is the [GPL - through its terms - that excludes liking by ASF licensed code](http://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html)).\n\nHaving said that, I suspect, given the [presence of MapR hadoop related code on github](https://github.com/mapr/hadoop-common/blob/release-2.7.0-mapr-1506/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/pom.xml), that their hadoop artifacts are released under ASF 2.0 but perhaps one of theirs, like @tdunning can help shedding some light. \n\nBut back to the profile: \n\nThe reason I ended up trying the profile approach is the fact Spark refers directly to Cloudera's and MapR's repositories on its main [pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.6/pom.xml#L285). This led me to conclude (perhaps incorrectly) that it would be ok to have a pom pointing to a particular set of artifacts as long the binary produced by the formal release does not break ASF or foreign license licensing restrictions.\n\nTo be hones, Spark's approach is even simpler than using profiles:\n\nTheir pom.xml includes all repo's enabled by default and [let the user specify the hadoop version as](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#specifying-the-hadoop-version):\n\n```\n# Cloudera CDH 4.2.0 with MapReduce v1\nmvn -Dhadoop.version=2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.2.0 -Phadoop-1 -DskipTests clean package\n```\n\nSmartly paying with the fact that while vendors must respect the artifact ID, they tend to distinguish their supported code by embedding their names into the software version(e.g. 2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.2.0, hadoop-hdfs-2.x-mapr-1506, etc).\n\nYet, given to support Spark's approach changes would have to be introduced to the main pom.xml, I decided to keep the scope of changes minimal, changing only `hadoop-libraries-nar` pom, hence reducing the potential of code spilling beyond planned/needed.\n\nHope this makes my way of thinking a bit clearer.\n\nPlease let me know your preference and I will be happy to adjust.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/225345538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/225345565","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/475#issuecomment-225345565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/475","id":225345565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTM0NTU2NQ==","user":{"login":"trixpan","id":3108527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3108527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan","html_url":"https://github.com/trixpan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trixpan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-11T08:58:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T08:58:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mattyb149 \n\nIt should be working. \n\nLet me try a build using a brand new MapR cluster + client environment and test.

Even with a local Ignite node running it does not seem to connect to it, normal?\n\nOther remark, in the logs, I see some periodic status about the Ignite instance\n\n```\n2016-06-14 22:16:25,694 INFO [grid-timeout-worker-#23%null%] org.apache.ignite.internal.IgniteKernal \nMetrics for local node (to disable set 'metricsLogFrequency' to 0)\n    ^-- Node [id=6b53a263, name=null, uptime=00:01:00:002]\n    ^-- H/N/C [hosts=2, nodes=2, CPUs=16]\n    ^-- CPU [cur=0.67%, avg=0.79%, GC=0%]\n    ^-- Heap [used=260MB, free=49.12%, comm=512MB]\n    ^-- Non heap [used=119MB, free=-1%, comm=125MB]\n    ^-- Public thread pool [active=0, idle=7, qSize=0]\n    ^-- System thread pool [active=0, idle=16, qSize=0]\n    ^-- Outbound messages queue [size=0]\n```\n\nI don't know if it makes sens to have this kind of logs in NiFi logs, thoughts?\n\nRegarding the transit URI of the provenance event, I am not convinced. Is there a way to get IP/port of the node the processor is connected to and use this information in the event? (like, I believe, it is done in Kafka processors)\n\nI believe there is also some kind of issues when stopping the processor: it doesn't seem to stop gracefully and I get some stack traces when trying to run it again...  in the end, none of the incoming flow files are ingested. Here is the stack trace if it helps (https://gist.github.com/pvillard31/d2e97008b36b4cd9edcfec8d5ed20b86#file-putignite-log)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226018504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/226113136","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/527#issuecomment-226113136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/527","id":226113136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjExMzEzNg==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T07:46:54Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T07:46:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM +1.
