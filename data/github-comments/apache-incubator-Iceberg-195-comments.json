Right now, I think we should focus on getting dataframe operations working and then move on to SQL after that.\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer. This syntax appears to need to wait for engine support. Or rewrite the engine's syntax file in the iceberg, as hudi did in spark 3.2 to support time travel. Otherwise, we don't seem to be able to use it in an earlier version of the engine. Of course, we can customize the engine's code and use it internally, but that's not realistic for a lot of tech teams, who tend to prefer out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nI don't know if that's the case with other teams, but we're more conservative in upgrading engine versions, for example, we're still using Spark 3.1 on a large scale. (That's why I raised a lot of PRs for reverse port of code to Spark3.1) , and use it for a long foreseeable period of time because we made a lot of internal changes to it and the upgrade wasn't that easy. \r\n\r\nBut no matter what, thanks again for your answer, I will remove it from this PR and keep only the option part.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\nLiwei","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1221714082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1221884262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5313#issuecomment-1221884262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5313","id":1221884262,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85I1Hlm","user":{"login":"a49a","id":12015546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDE1NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12015546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a","html_url":"https://github.com/a49a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a49a/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-22T06:09:12Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T06:12:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> For the test, shall we also check the read path to make sure bloom filters are there?\r\n\r\nI find the ORC SDK will auto recognize the bloom filter in the following code.

Metadata and data updates are intended to be separate, although I can see why there are cases where you'd assume that they are not.\r\n\r\nIf you update the schema and commit data in a single job, then it isn't unreasonable to assume the schema change would be rolled back. But if I concurrently add a column while someone else commits, then a rollback should be independent. Expectations can go both ways.\r\n\r\nWhile expectations differ, Iceberg never rolls back to a previous schema because that operation is unsafe. For example, if someone deletes a required column and then tries to roll that back, there may have been data written without that column.
