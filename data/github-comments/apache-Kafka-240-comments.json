to give an example to what I said in the previous comment: inside `RecordCollectorImpl#send()` we call `producer.send()` which could throw the following exceptions (assuming EOS is enabled):\r\n\r\n1. `TimeoutException`: fetching metadata timed out, this is a fatal error since the topic may not exist forever. We should capture it higher in code hierarchy in `StreamTask#process()`, try-catch `currNode.process()` and abort transaction / close task. Also we need to rethrow this exception so that users can be notified and close the whole instance (we can re-consider the global exception handling in another JIRA).\r\n\r\n2. `SerializationException`: this should never happen since we are using `byte<>, byte<>`, hence it'll be a bug if it really happens. We should fail-fast the whole instance directly, i.e. try-catch on even higher level `StreamThread#run()` and shutdown the whole instance.\r\n\r\n3. `ProducerFencedException`: a rebalance has happened and the thread's consumer has fallen out of the group. We should try-catch it in lower level `StreamTask#process()`'s `currNode.process()` and abort transaction / close task. However we do not need to rethrow the exception for this case, and hoping the next consumer.poll will rejoin the group with the callbacks to revoke / reassign tasks.\r\n\r\nSo we can see that it's better to list all these exceptions and consider capturing them on different levels of the hierarchy to handle them differently. In the future when there is a bug, it will be then easier to traverse the code path and locate its root cause.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/300343411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/300374122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3005#issuecomment-300374122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3005","id":300374122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDM3NDEyMg==","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T05:00:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T05:00:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just realized that the JavaDoc of this class is not correct: Can you please fix this as a side task?\r\n\r\nIt says: \"setting the application's consumer offsets for input and internal topics to zero\".

Sorry, I was traveling etc. So haven't had time to look into the failures yet. I haven't had a chance to look at this PR yet, but noticed there was the JAAS configuration failure even with this PR. The only way that could occur is if we are leaving some threads behind in some tests which load `Configuration`. I will take a look at the test changes in the last few weeks and also dump threads at the time of failure to narrow that one down. I think this PR makes the code a lot neater, so that is very good. And obviously `closeSasl` needs to be added to the test. I will try and narrow down the threads being left behind in tests and come back to this PR later today. Hope that is ok.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/300508327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/300511446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3010#issuecomment-300511446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3010","id":300511446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDUxMTQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-10T15:04:28Z","updated_at":"2017-05-10T15:04:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rajinisivaram, thanks for the update.
