In general, I fear native bindings because they can introduce interesting, unexpected problems.  When they speed things up, it can definitely be useful, however.\n\nGiven that the library tries to do local resolution of compiled things (similar to what we did with sigar), I think it's an ok tradeoff to keep it around.  That said, sigar was moved to an extension entirely because it is native code and has caused core dumps before (it's 100% not thread-safe).  I'd feel more comfortable if this was an extension point, but am willing to compromise.\n\nGiven that this slows down performance on Mac laptops and that most people are going to come and kick the tires on whatever their developer box is, it might make sense to actually be more intelligent about which should be used based on the environment.  It seems like the library does a poor job determining what the \"fastest instance\" is on a Mac, so perhaps we should add logic that defaults to non-native when it sees that it is running on a Mac?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/90674040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/90697083","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1247#issuecomment-90697083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1247","id":90697083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwNjk3MDgz","user":{"login":"rasahner","id":3065997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3065997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner","html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-07T18:54:14Z","updated_at":"2015-04-07T18:54:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"While you're in the documentation, maybe you'd like to address a couple of trivial things in Tutorial:A-First-Look-at_Druid.html (seemed too trivial to have a separate jira, especially as you might want to just leave them alone):\n.

For most applications, I would imagine that the time it takes to decompress or uncompress the data matters more than the overhead of the native bindings. In our case we just happen to make a lot of calls and the binding overhead may be what is slowing us down here.\n\nGiven that people's preference is to stick with what works best in production, I am going to close this. We can revisit if we ever have evidence of when this may not the best choice in production. If someone feels strongly about making this configurable, please submit a pull request, but I doubt this is going to make or break someone's decision whether to use Druid or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/90749148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/90951761","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1262#issuecomment-90951761","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1262","id":90951761,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkwOTUxNzYx","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T15:31:53Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T15:31:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"have

When opening multiple docs tab, pages tend to get lost due to static page title ;)\n\nDon't know if this PR is right place for that change though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/93422365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/93457435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1281#issuecomment-93457435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1281","id":93457435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzNDU3NDM1","user":{"login":"drcrallen","id":8213081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMTMwODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8213081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen","html_url":"https://github.com/drcrallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drcrallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-15T15:52:49Z","updated_at":"2015-04-15T15:52:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@davrodpin : Can you please keep your Azure stuff in one PR instead of spreading them out?
