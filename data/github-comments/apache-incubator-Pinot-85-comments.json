A couple of ways to do this:\r\n- Provide a method to start the offset of the current consuming segment at a certain point. So, if a segment started consumption at offset 100, but had a problem at 120, the user can set the start offset to be (say) 125. In this case, there is loss of data from 100 to 120. Hopefully there are no bad offsets beyond 125.\r\n- Provide a method to skip certain offsets in a stream-partition. The user specifies an array of offsets that are to be skipped by the consumer. This is more complicated in terms of user-interface, but preserves maximum data possible.\r\n\r\nI expect the second option to be a bit more complex in implementation as well. We will need to consume each row and check whether it is taboo or not.\r\n\r\nI prefer the first approach -- big hammer but simple(r).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/790119420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/790142216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6613#issuecomment-790142216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6613","id":790142216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDE0MjIxNg==","user":{"login":"icefury71","id":728023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODAyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71","html_url":"https://github.com/icefury71","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icefury71/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-03T23:15:51Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T23:15:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks so much for this PR. As part of this can we also add a new API to enable credential verification ? (eg: from the Cluster Manager UI). I'm thinking of something like this: \"http://controller-host:port/verifyauth\" where you pass in the token and verify whether its correct. \r\n\r\nThe other option is to annotate one of the existing APIs eg: GET /tables with \"Authenticate\" and reuse that. However, a new API might be cleaner. What do you think ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/790142216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/790176864","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6640#issuecomment-790176864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/6640","id":790176864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDE3Njg2NA==","user":{"login":"xiangfu0","id":1202120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIxMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangfu0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangfu0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T00:11:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T00:11:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please also update assemble file in pinot-distribution to ensure the shaded jar is packaged correctly.
