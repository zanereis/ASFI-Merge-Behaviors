I started with a clean build from a branch that is near to current master. The color theme was light (as I did not change it I assume \"FlatLaf Light\"). I changed the color theme for the terminal. After that I changed the LAF to \"FlatLaf Cupertino Dark\". After the adviced restart the terminal still had my modified color. However after choosing \"Restore\" I got a dark background with light text color. This is what I would expect for a dark theme.\r\n\r\nThen I switched back to \"FlatLaf Light\", restarted and found the terminal still light text on dark background. Again choosing \"Restore\" for the Terminalsettings brought me the right colors for the Terminal (dark text on light background).\r\n\r\nSo for me the button does the right think.

And thus I strongly resist people wanting to use lombok @work. We have some legacy code and for that the situation was improved by specifying the lombok version as a property and I override that in my `settings.xml` to point to a recent version of lombok that makes it work again, without having to modify the project.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1843320135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1843323918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6803#issuecomment-1843323918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6803","id":1843323918,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5t3uQO","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-06T17:16:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T17:16:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jepsar you might get help if you produce a minimal reproducer.

SpringBoot plugin has also `run` and yet different properties that control it.

The navigator relies on the parsing of the file. This is a hard task and can take siginificantly longer than opening the file. This can be done in the background, but people are already complaining about the indexing work NetBeans is doing in the background, that would get worse.\r\n\r\nYes, my question is whether allocating memory for real-time data caching when the IDE has sufficient memory can speed up the process. However, the optimization of the Eclipse IDE outline is done quite well, giving me an experience of opening it almost instantly\r\n\r\nI have been observing the trend of the Netbneas IDE all along, and its application functions are not bad. The main reason for the problem may be that the IO processing experience has always been very poor, giving users the feeling that their computer configuration is poor. If the experience is so slow, it may lead to many users stopping making the first choice. One of the reasons may be this, and secondly","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1848364896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1848418317","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6797#issuecomment-1848418317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6797","id":1848418317,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5uLKAN","user":{"login":"rothardo","id":83207402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjA3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83207402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo","html_url":"https://github.com/rothardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rothardo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-09T14:00:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T20:07:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @mbien,\r\n\r\n I've gone through the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/120f2129a8dbc25b7a52542c359fe5a7a2569c60/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the NetBeans project and I'm seeking some clarification on the squashing process. I attempted to squash my commits interactively in Vim, but encountered conflicts during the process.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm puzzled by an unexpected commit in the pull request [6797](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6797). In commit [8916655](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6797/commits/891665543a70e466b4fd862f32b495a3e7b4252c), I reconfigured the author's name.
