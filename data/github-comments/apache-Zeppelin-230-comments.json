@zhugezifang Hello, sorry for the late reply. I glance at your PR and suggest you make a child interpreter like `jdbc.debug` instead of adding a menu. The debug paragraph is currently only for JDBC, but the menu would be exposed for all kinds of paragraphs. `zeppelin-interpreter` package and `NotebookServer` class affect all of interpreters. If you want to make an interpreter-specific feature, I recommend adding a new sub-interpreter. WDYT?\r\n\r\n@jongyoul hi，the  menu of sql debug is controlled, it only can be viewed and used in jdbc interpreter, it cannot be viewed in other interpreter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1619421731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/1619822641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4481#issuecomment-1619822641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4481","id":1619822641,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfU5DM5gjIgx","user":{"login":"shefali163","id":31477542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDc3NTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31477542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163","html_url":"https://github.com/shefali163","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shefali163/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-04T08:52:13Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T08:52:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @Reamer, is this PR blocked because of something else?

The debug paragraph is currently only for JDBC, but the menu would be exposed for all kinds of paragraphs. `zeppelin-interpreter` package and `NotebookServer` class affect all of interpreters. If you want to make an interpreter-specific feature, I recommend adding a new sub-interpreter.
