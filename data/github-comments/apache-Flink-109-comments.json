The `TypeInfo` check in `UnionOperator` cannot be removed, because it prevents that incompatible serializers are used at runtime. However, the equality check of the `RowTypeInfo` is a bit too strict. `RowTypeInfo` is based on `CaseClassInfo` which check for field types and names (which is fine for case classes). However, for `Row` we only need to check for types. Actually, I think we can remove the `fieldNames` parameter from the `RowTypeInfo` constructor and always create default field names (\"f0\", \"f1\", ...) as done in some of the other constructors.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/224952354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/224957238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2063#issuecomment-224957238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2063","id":224957238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDk1NzIzOA==","user":{"login":"omaralvarez","id":5764407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjQ0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5764407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez","html_url":"https://github.com/omaralvarez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omaralvarez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-09T16:52:36Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T16:52:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is everything ok?

Do you think this could be easily added with this PR or rather be fix in a later issue?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/225608818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/225611960","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1881#issuecomment-225611960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1881","id":225611960,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTYxMTk2MA==","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T15:14:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T15:14:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, I will close this...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/225611960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/225612863","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2049#issuecomment-225612863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2049","id":225612863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTYxMjg2Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-13T15:17:40Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T15:17:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the fast update @gallenvara.

However, I'd like to close this PR for now for the following reasons:\n1. The new shard-to-subtask assignment logic introduced with this change will actually need to be moved again to run() as part of implementing Kinesis reshard handling ([FLINK-3231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-3231)).\n2. I've tested this change a bit more on Kinesis streams with high shard counts, and it seems like the implementation needs more guarantee on that all subtasks will be able to get the shard list without failing with Amazon's LimitExceededException even after 3 retries. Since the implementation for FLINK-3231 will have a separate thread that polls for changes in the shard list, I'd like to strengthen this guarantee as part of FLINK-3231's PR.\n\nI'm almost done with FLINK-3231, and will reopen a PR to resolve FLINK-3231 and FLINK-4020 together.

You can access it directly or via getMetricGroup().\n\nAlso, you create 2 groups with a constant name. This means that all metrics that are registered in a trigger now contain \"WindowOperator.Trigger\" in their final metric name.\n\nNow the Trigger group is probably _fine_, but is now also mandatory. I would prefer removing it; if users want to group their metrics by Trigger they can easily do so themselves.\n\nThe WindowOperator group should be removed. It is inconsistent with other operators and provides no really specific information. It will usually be redundant since the operator name often contains the String \"window\" somewhere.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/226195305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/226198638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2106#issuecomment-226198638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2106","id":226198638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjE5ODYzOA==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-15T14:09:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T14:09:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, good to know.
