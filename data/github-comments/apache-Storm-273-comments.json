The existing integration tests use the old Java client to create an Elasticsearch node during test setup.

The elasticsearch-maven-plugin only supports launching a single Elasticsearch version, as does EsIntegTestCase.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is an interesting blog post by someone at Elastic describing how to install and start Elasticsearch for testing using Maven Ant tasks: <a href=\"http://david.pilato.fr/blog/2016/10/18/elasticsearch-real-integration-tests-updated-for-ga/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://david.pilato.fr/blog/2016/10/18/elasticsearch-real-integration-tests-updated-for-ga/</a>.

The system is more about resilience in such a way that it should not be a big problem if a system, that lies behind a downward bolt, is temporarily unavailable. Instead of simply \"skipping\" such failed records (after their retry count is reached) they should then - and only then - be written to the mentioned \"dead-letter-topic\".

I am reading through your detailed explanation again and will let you know my opinion concerning the need, or no need, for the parameter `maxUncommittedOffsets`, based on all the facts you state. \r\n\r\nPrior to that, however, I will share right away what is the rationale behind `maxUncommittedOffsets` and why I think we still need it. \r\n\r\n`maxUncommittedOffsets` is unrelated to `ConsumerConfig#MAX_POLL_RECORDS_CONFIG` and to `Config#TOPOLOGY_MAX_SPOUT_PENDING`. It's purpose is to allow the `KafkaSpout` to keep polling/fetching records from Kafka while imposing a (memory consumption) limit on how many offsets can be **polled and non committed over ANY ARBITRARY NUMBER of polls to Kafka (not just one poll)**, before the KafkaSpout stops polling. \r\n\r\nThis limit is necessary because if e.g. tuple for offset **3** keeps failing, and all subsequent offsets **(4, 5, 6, ... 1M, ... 1B, ...)** are acked, the spout won't be able to commit to Kafka any offset greater than 3, unless it reaches **maxNumberOfRetrials**. If there is no limit on **maxNumberOfRetrials** (in order to guarantee at least once delivery), and offset 3 keeps failing forever, the spout won't ever be able to commit any offset > 3. In the limit this would cause the `Map<TopicPartition, OffsetManager> acked` to grow to infinite size (despite it's small footprint, which is constituted of mainly offsets and some bookkeeping small objects - it doesn't have `ConsumerRecord`s). \r\n\r\nIn order to put a cap on the size of this map, `maxUncommittedOffset` was created to stop polling if this number is too high, and avoid `OutOfMemoryError`. **The purpose of the KafkaSpout keeping on polling despite a particular offset (tuple) keeping on failing is to increase the overall throughput.** If at some point the offset 3 is successfully acked, the max subset of continuous offsets acked would be committed to Kafka in the next `Timer commitTimer` cycle, and the size of `Map<TopicPartition, OffsetManager> acked` would be reduced (potentially by a lot). The spout could then keep doing its work and the overall throughput would be much higher.\r\n\r\n`maxUncommittedOffsets` is not a hard limit parameter, and I don't think that we have to enforce that the KafkaSpout never exceeds this number. It is OK to exceed it as long as the JVM doesn't throw `OutOfMemoryError`. Currently, and prior to these proposed changes, in the worse case **maxUncommittedOffsets** is upper bounded by  **maxUncommittedOffsets + maxFetchRecords - 1**, which is OK as long as there is memory. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the name `maxUncommittedOffsets` is not the most clear name. We can either change the name (which can cause background compatibility issues and/or confusion), or document properly what this parameter really means. The bottom line is that I think that we need a parameter doing the job that `maxUncommittedOffsets` is currently doing, which I don't think can be accomplished with a combination of`ConsumerConfig#MAX_POLL_RECORDS_CONFIG` and/or `Config#TOPOLOGY_MAX_SPOUT_PENDING`\r\n\r\nThe name `maxUncommittedOffsets` should more precisely be something like `allowPollingIflLessThanMaxUncommittedOffsets`\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts. I will still go over your explanation again in the meantime.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/286493523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/286529436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1924#issuecomment-286529436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1924","id":286529436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjUyOTQzNg==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-14T19:12:15Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T19:12:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hmcl Thanks for the explanation. It makes more sense now.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can meaningfully handle the case where the user has specified no cap on retries and one or more tuples keep failing.\r\n\r\nIn the situation you describe, `maxUncommittedOffsets` isn't really solving the problem. If offset 3 fails and all other tuples can be acked, the spout will emit another `maxUncommittedOffsets` tuples on the same partition as 3, and will then stop emitting because it can't commit any tuples until 3 is acked. At this point, only offset 3 will get re-emitted until it hopefully succeeds at some point, so having a continually failing tuple (or just one that fails many times) will still \"clog\" the spout.\r\n\r\nIf `maxUncommittedOffsets` is removed, you're right that the `acked` map size is technically uncapped, but given the amount of information we store, and how the spout handles retries, I think it is a non-issue. Just to illustrate, say we remove `maxUncommittedOffsets`, and let's say again that offset 3 is failing a large number of times, and the last acked offset is far beyond it, e.g. 5000000. When 3 is ready for retry, the consumer is reset to that position on the relevant partition. This means it fetches and emits message 3. It will also have to fetch 4...5000000 (potentially over many calls to `poll()`), because we never seek forward to where we left off). The spout therefore has to spend time fetching and discarding all tuples up to 5000000 before it can finally emit another tuple. It seems likely that it'll hit the point where it is spending all the time fetching and discarding acked tuples earlier than it'll run out of memory to store their offsets.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the issue with consumer seeking, because my reasoning relies on an implementation detail of how we do retries, I'm still not sure `maxUncommittedOffsets` is allowing higher throughput compared to not having it. If we allow the spout to fail with an `OutOfMemoryError`, the spout will have had higher throughput up to the crash than if it were being throttled by `maxUncommittedOffsets` (because otherwise it would also have had an OOME in that case). It really seems to me like all `maxUncommittedOffsets` is doing is trading having the spout potentially cause an OOME due to `acked` size, in exchange for making the spout react to the same situation by not emitting any more tuples. I'm not sure that is better, because data flow stops in either case. \r\n\r\n`maxUncommittedOffsets` could have some value in a system where the `KafkaSpout` is a secondary stream source and the messages coming out of it aren't time sensitive. In that case it might be fine to let the `KafkaSpout` stop emitting tuples for a while if some tuples temporarily can't be acked, but having it cause an OOME would be too disruptive because the primary spout could be doing fine. I can't come up with a concrete example of this kind of configuration though.\r\n\r\nI'd be fine with keeping `maxUncommittedOffsets` for that kind of situation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/286529436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/286530612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1999#issuecomment-286530612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1999","id":286530612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjUzMDYxMg==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-14T19:16:48Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T19:16:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is this necessary to handle in the spout?
