It would be appreciated if you could share a sample code. Thank you.\r\n\r\nhi @jlimmm! Unfortunately I don't have the code anymore but the PR has an example of creating a network consisting of a single int4 conv2d

https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6748, so you could reuse most of the AutoTVM tutorial code, but simply replace the network with the network shown above\r\n\r\nAutoTVM will then be able to automatically infer the int4+tensorcore

I agree that the focus here is to shortlist these ops to the set defined in the registry. To use the example of `QLinearReduceMean` that gets emitted as `QLinearDequantzie->ReduceMean->QLinearQuantize`, there is no need for TVM to support the `QLinearReduceMean` for now. I will therefore as a next task emphasize the short list of ops that we should support to enable any ONNXRT quantized models.
