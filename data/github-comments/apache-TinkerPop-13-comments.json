Your code change looks sensible as you show in your comment and it's good to know that works, but now you need to get us that code (with a unit test) in a good pull request that we can review/accept. \n\nI assume that the reason you can't push is because you cloned the apache repository. Again, you need to fork the Apache TinkerPop repo and make your changes there, then submit your pull request to us from that. When you submit your pull request it should only have your changes in it (note above how you have tons of commits from lots of different people - that's always an indicator that something isn't right). I gave pretty explicit instructions on how to proceed in that mailing list post. I hope you can get familiar with GitHub processes to submit this fix - it would be appreciated.\n\nI'm going to close this PR from my end.

If you could just clean up the git history now a little bit as we've had a lot of back and forth to get this right. Let's squash all of your commits into one:\n\n``` text\ngit rebase -i tp31-graphml HEAD~7\n```\n\nYou should get a summary of all  7 of your commits (i.e. HEAD~7). The instructions explain what to do, but basically, just change all but the first \"pick\" entry to \"squash\" and all of those ones you mark with \"squash\" will fold into the remaining \"pick\". so it looks like you have just once nice commit. After you do that, you can adjust the commit message for the squash to have just one good message that describes your change.  You might want to review a tutorial or two on `squash` before you pull the trigger if you aren't familiar:\n\nhttp://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html\n\nThen you push:\n\n``` text\ngit push your-remote tp31-graphml --force\n```\n\nNote that \"your-remote\" should be the name of the git remote for your repo which i assume is \"origin\" and further note, that you need `--force` because you are re-writing history on that branch (i.e. 7 commits becoming 1). Once you do that, i would think the PR should auto-update and travis will fire off again. Should be good from there.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/224696715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/224713854","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/333#issuecomment-224713854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/333","id":224713854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDcxMzg1NA==","user":{"login":"SergeVil","id":1698855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTg4NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1698855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil","html_url":"https://github.com/SergeVil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergeVil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-08T20:15:38Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T20:15:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see that some commits have been disappeared in my history, I believe they are merged altogether.
