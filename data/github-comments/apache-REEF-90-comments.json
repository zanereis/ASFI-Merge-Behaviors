While I could get it to collect some data, I don't think it is completely in line with what we set out to achieve when we started building a metrics system for Reef:\r\n\r\n- First and foremost, EventSource/EvenCounters seem to be designed for the user to define the ETW provider, so only for Windows applications. I couldn't find any examples of how event capturing was used in different OS's. \r\n- The above comment mentioned the viewing tool kept history; in the examples I found PerfView to be the primary tool used to view all the collected events over a timespan (is this what you meant?) The tool collects events on a specified interval, and calculates statistics on the execution times of events captured during that interval (mean, standard deviation, etc.) However, if I wanted to take these values and send them somewhere else, for example AML training service, I haven't found a way to do it easily.\r\n- EventSource/EventCounter seem pretty confined to numbers and strings, I'm not sure there is an easy way to collect metrics of user defined types.\r\n\r\nThere were two original goals of this PR, one was to maintain a timeseries of updates of a single metrics, and the other was to support any type of metric that the user would specify. For the first one, I feel a push model is more suitable, and with help and many iterations it is finally not needing additional locks that might be a hit to performance while still preserving the entire history of updates.\r\n\r\nFinally, to the last point, I feel this would probably be a sink implementation, where the metrics collected by MetricsService would be sent somewhere that is queryable by the user. Let me know what you think.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/394538361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/394783512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1460#issuecomment-394783512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1460","id":394783512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDc4MzUxMg==","user":{"login":"singlis","id":17055319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDU1MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17055319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis","html_url":"https://github.com/singlis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/singlis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-05T16:55:48Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T16:55:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Mandy for the information!\r\n\r\nSo EventCounters are cross plat, they are recommended to use over the Performance counters because of that reason. They do have roots from Performance Counters, which can be a bit confusing.  Please refer to the reply here by vancem:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.Tracing/documentation/EventCounterTutorial.md\r\n\r\nAs for PerfView, yes that is my understanding for the current toolset. For Windows, you maybe able to also use the Performance Monitor, but I haven't been able to confirm that. There should be an .net API that allows for collection of these values, please see the EventListener:\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventlistener(v=vs.110).aspx\r\nIt handles a OnEventWritten function when an event is written. \r\n\r\nAlso EventSource looks to support different types of formats looking at the EventFieldFormat enum:\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventfieldformat(v=vs.110).aspx\r\n\r\nOk, so now looking more at this. It looks like if you use EventCounters, they will notify you when an event counter updates via the EventListener. So this is a push model. You can collect this data like you are doing now on the evaluator and submit that via the heartbeat. The driver would then aggregate this data.\r\n\r\nGiven this information, would this work? Sounds like it matches the requirements in that you would not miss a data point as you could via the pull method. Also what I like about the EventCounters is that its utilizing the .net core api. \r\n\r\nLet me know -- Im happy to also review what you have.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/394783512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/394894439","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1464#issuecomment-394894439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1464","id":394894439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDg5NDQzOQ==","user":{"login":"sharathmalladi","id":9726998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MjY5OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9726998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi","html_url":"https://github.com/sharathmalladi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharathmalladi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-05T23:40:17Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T23:40:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pinging

I added primitive children classes to MetricBase<T> for the pirmitive type Interlocked.Exchanges(int, double, long, float), and a MetricClass<T> for reference type Interlocked.Exchange(string and other classes). Only if all of these fail will a lock(_metricLock) be used.\r\nThe updated value is then passed to the tracker to create a new record, which also records a timestamp, instead of getting the timestamp from the metric itself.\r\n\r\n**Passing metrics from the Evaluator to the Driver:**\r\n - KeepUpdateRecord == true: Each tracker maintains a ConcurrentQueue(q1) of records. On the heartbeat, each tracker create a new ConcurrentQueue(q2), moves the contents of q1 to q2 one by one until q1 is empty, then passes q2 to the driver. In the meantime, new records can still be added to q1 safely.\r\n - KeepUpdateRecord == false: On the Evaluator side, no records will be created and q1 will be empty until the heartbeat. On the heartbeat, one single record will be created from the value held by the metric object, the record will be put in q2, then passed.\r\n\r\n**Updating metrics received from Evaluator when multiple Evaluators try to update the same metric:**\r\n - KeepUpdateRecord == true: records received from the evaluator are added to the driver's ConcurrentQueue one by one.\r\n - KeepUpdateRecord == false: Driver's records are reassigned to the received records using Interlocked.Exchange.\r\n\r\n**Sinking metrics on Driver side:**\r\n - same as Passing metrics from Evaluator to Driver","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/396795540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/396796468","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/1460#issuecomment-396796468","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/1460","id":396796468,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Njc5NjQ2OA==","user":{"login":"mandyshieh","id":10294689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjk0Njg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10294689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh","html_url":"https://github.com/mandyshieh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandyshieh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-13T02:46:52Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T02:46:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I realized that boxing and unboxing wouldn't work how I initially thought after our discussion because _typedValue variable doesn't reflect changes once it's boxed into an object, so I instead reverted back to individual primitive implementations, each with its own Interlocked.Exchange call, plus a MetricClass that takes reference type exchanges.
