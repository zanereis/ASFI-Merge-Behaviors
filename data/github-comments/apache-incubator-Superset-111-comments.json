Even if you set the query to only capture the fiscal year, it will leak into another year on the time axis. For example:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34284871/33629004-8cb3fde2-d9d0-11e7-9ca0-9acb6395e2b7.png)\r\n\r\nThe data starts at fiscal year 2015 (10/1/14 to 9/30/15), but the time axis will split some into the 2014 bucket. It would be nice to have a built in offset for things like this.

It breaks down even worse when you make the time grains quarters and months.\r\n\r\nMy current work around is having fiscal year as a string and using the **distribution** bar chart (instead of the time series) to show the years over time. But that only works for years, and also doesn't allow the use of line charts and the other cool time series visualizations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/349433148/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/349443510","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3840#issuecomment-349443510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/3840","id":349443510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTQ0MzUxMA==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-05T21:14:43Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T21:14:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch one solution would be to use the query string as the cache key as opposed to the form data (the query response is actually what we're trying to cache).

If you add the **doctype** on the `basic.html`, recompile and re-run, you should be able to reproduce the issue.\r\nIn regards to the requested clarification, we have an internal application written in Angular 5. We wanted to use some functionality from Superset so we build and bundle Superset and wrap some pieces into Angular components. It works fine, except in some places where things disappear due to the existence of the **doctype** on our `index.html`.\r\nIs there a reason for not adding the **doctype** on the application?\r\n\r\nBtw, on the initial bug report I stated as **not rendering** the panel which I end up verifying that it is incorrect. The browser renders the panel as all HTML is present on the DOM. However, there's something setting the container to 100% height but effectively sets the container to 0px.

to hear it's on the roadmap indeed! The \"scoped\" dashboard section would be a dream come true to be honest. Here is a list of the limitations we tend to bump into on top of the \"dimension split on the dashboard level\" if that helps you in any way with the design:\r\n- Mixing various data sources in one dashboard is doable but difficult since Filter Box will apply to all slice (so if the filtered dimension is not in one of the datasource, those slices won't display any data)\r\n- We have a few sets of filters that we want to apply to a group of slices only, which atm forces us to reload the entire dashboard when we use the Filter Box (which can be pretty heavy if you don't take precautions)\r\n- The per-dimensions-configuration would indeed be a nice addition\r\n- We have ~15 dimensions on which we regularly apply filters so we had to break the Filter Box in smaller ones to allow for fast load of the Filter Box itself (the first filter box only contains the time filtering and our main dimension, the second ones contains more advanced dimensions, and a third only contains dimensions that are rarely used). This is working fine but require a bit of juggling with `Apply` button and FilterBox `Force Refresh` Button.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to ask for more details if you need. Thank you!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/349933110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/349933632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4026#issuecomment-349933632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4026","id":349933632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTkzMzYzMg==","user":{"login":"dengshaochun","id":29160619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTYwNjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29160619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun","html_url":"https://github.com/dengshaochun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengshaochun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-07T10:57:05Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T10:57:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"how to fix \r\nif i query like is\r\n```sql\r\nselect indb_time, TotalFiles, BlocksTotal \r\nfrom hdfs_info_logs \r\nwhere statis_date>=20171101 \r\nand DATE_FORMAT(indb_time, '%%H%%i%%S') = '000000';\r\n```\r\nand use Visualize , it will auto add double % in my query\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29160619/33711736-fc127b04-db7f-11e7-97e2-81d781185dfa.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/349933632/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":2,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/349982358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4008#issuecomment-349982358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4008","id":349982358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTk4MjM1OA==","user":{"login":"michailsal","id":7482155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODIxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7482155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal","html_url":"https://github.com/michailsal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michailsal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-07T14:27:16Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T14:27:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't know what else to add here, when I delete a metric from a slice it shows as being deleted, but when I save the action afterwards by clicking save, the same metric comes back to the slice.
