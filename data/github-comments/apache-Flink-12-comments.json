It is going into a good direction.\n\nWhat needs to be adjusted is the way that the job manager gets accessed.\nThe current code creates a new jobmanager (that is just sitting there\ndoing nothing). It really needs to connect to an existing jobmanager\nby getting an ActorRef to it.\n\nI think it would be nice to split this large method up into multiple\nmethods that serve different information at different URLs. That would\nbe more REST style. Something like\n\n``` java\npublic class JobManagerInfoService {\n\n    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(JobManagerInfoService.class);\n\n    private final ActorRef jobManager;\n    private final ActorRef archive;\n    private final FiniteDuration timeout;\n\n    public JobManagerInfoService( ... ) {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    @Path(\"/taskmanagers\")\n    public class TaskManagerAction {\n\n        @GET\n        @Produces(\"application/json\")\n        public String getTaskManagers(HttpServletRequest request) {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Path(\"/cancelJob\")\n    public class TaskManagerAction {\n\n        @GET\n        @Produces(\"application/json\")\n        public String getTaskManagers(HttpServletRequest request, @QueryParam(\"job\") String jobId) {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLow priority:\n- Is it possible to create the JSON strings using a library? The manual ceation is always error prone. I think that the\n  Jackson JSON library is being used in other parts of Flink anyways.\n- When referencing Scala case object from Java (such as the JobManagerMessages), it is better to create a utility method in the\n  declaring scala class to obtain them (similar as in the class `TaskManagerMessages`). This helps both the code readability,\n  and some IDEs.

I'll address the inline comments.\n\nRegarding the questions:\n1. The separation between `flink-yarn` and `flink-yarn-tests` exists because the `flink-yarn-tests` expect the `flink-dist` package to be build before the `flink-yarn-tests` package.\nThe tests are really starting a YARN cluster and deploying a flink fat-jar to it. Therefore, we need to run `flink-dist` first. I asked on the maven mailing list if there is a way of simplifying this and it seems to be possible to store the archetype descriptors (used to build the fat-jar) in a separate maven module which is then accessed by `flink-dist` and a `prepare-tests` phase of `flink-yarn`. But for that approach, we would need to create an additional maven module (something like `flink-assemblies` for making the assembly descriptor independent of the `flink-dist` package). \n\n  _tl;dr_ maven is not flexible enough for a better solution.\n2. Yep. That doesn't make much sense (I used a local yarn cluster for testing it .. thats why I didn't really stumble across it). I'll fix it.\n3. This is true for the old YARN client (before this pull request). As you can see here: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/292/files#diff-37b2363833862d636afea47fab39a694L269 I removed the code that was computing the port. This new YARN client is allocating ALL ports dynamically (web frontend, RPC). I'm using YARN to transfer the RPC port of the AM to the client.\n4. Probably not hard. Its a matter of taste I guess. I think my approach is more flexible (imagine we want to have a `-m mesos-cluster` or a `-m flink-local` at some point). Also, we would need to throw an exception if a user is setting something like `-j -m myCluster:6123`. It would be good to get some more opinions here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/70416726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/70416739","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/294#issuecomment-70416739","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/294","id":70416739,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDE2NzM5","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-18T17:24:04Z","updated_at":"2015-01-18T17:24:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What happens to this PR?

The test coverage is massive - very good for a delicate concept like this :-)\n\nOne remaining issue is the naming of the methods/concepts and how they are exposed in the APIs.\n- I personally liked it better the way it was before. For example, binary operators returned `DualInputSematicProperties` and the methods were `getForwardedFieldsFirst(int field)`. That looked more intuitive for API users than operating on the interface `SemanticProperties` and using `getTargetFields(input, position)`.\n- The backwards access (get source field for target field) is relevant only in the optimizer, correct?\n  Is there some way to expose that to th eoptimizer only? It makes the public API more confusing.\n- Is it necessary to have the extra methods `hasFieldForwardInformation()`? This again makes it more complicated to use. Can we not simply have a null entry for fields that have no forward information?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/70421463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/70422236","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/305#issuecomment-70422236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/305","id":70422236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDIyMjM2","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-18T19:41:03Z","updated_at":"2015-01-18T19:41:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I do not see how this can possibly work on a cluster...
