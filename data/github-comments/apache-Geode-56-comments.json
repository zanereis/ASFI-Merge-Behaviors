Now, I think that it would be better to change uniqID from AtomicInteger to AtomicLong. The Integer.MAX_VALUE is just to small, and because of that, uniqID would overflow to often with this solution. That could possibly cause conflict between new transactions and old transactions (that are suspended or hang) with same uniqID.\r\n\r\nIt would require much bigger impact on the code to use AtomicLong. Also, It would be necessary to preserve backward compatibility with the old client that would still use integer for the uniqID.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

The question was previously asked on the dev list \"who owns the CODEOWNERS file\"  but never answered...\r\n\r\nCODEOWNERS is currently ownerless since the syntax Robert tried didn't work.  I'd like to be tagged on any modification just to review that changes are syntactically sound, minimum of 2 owners is maintained, formatting is consistent, and all owners are committers.  I have no desire to interfere with any actual changes in ownership.  But I would also be fine with keeping CODEOWNERS ownerless if that is perceived as the only democratic solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/765588723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/765601387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5910#issuecomment-765601387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5910","id":765601387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTYwMTM4Nw==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-22T18:22:48Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T18:22:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging ec68c949e81be075cb93c37079d84e8229dd6940 into 964051b7029d73ee4e6bed96f30e0fd3ee23bb79 -

Please review it when you're available.\r\n\r\n@masaki-yamakawa \r\nParticipants in team discussion: @jchen21 @dschneider-pivotal \r\nThanks for your PR. Sorry for delay in responding to this. \r\n\r\nWe had a team discussion around this PR as it deflects from the way Geode configuration is done (the recommended way). In the past Geode/GemFire was built with cache.xml as a way to configure the system; based on its drawback and keep the overall cluster configuration easier, it was decided to adopt/build Cluster Configuration Service with gfsh as the tool to accomplish it (currently there is work getting done to support the same through new management APIs). As the Cluster Configuration Service got matured, the use of xml is gradually getting deprecated.\r\nThe change proposed with this ticket/PR feels like going back to the cache.xml way of configuring the system. Can you please let us know the reason behind not using the cluster configuration service and going with cache.xml; we would like to understand more about the usecase/requirement and see if there are any other better options.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can achieve what you are looking for, by exporting the cluster configuration info (once defined using gfsh - which is an xml output) and then importing it to any test/dev/prod system. Can this suffice your requirement?\r\n\r\nOn the other note, based on the PR review, it expects the user class to be in the server side classpath; currently this is not a requirement while using PDX type/object; one of the main functionality of PDX is to support data stores without needing a class definition on the server. The product takes care of this internally when one configures the jdbc mapping automatically.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know your thoughts.\r\n    ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/770014534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/770501970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5828#issuecomment-770501970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5828","id":770501970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDUwMTk3MA==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T01:31:28Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T01:37:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jinmei it looks like the test DistributedSystemMBeanIntegrationTest.queryAllUsingGfshDoesNotFormatDate was expecting LocalDate objects to be serialized as POJOs (i.e. the test expects to see the internal serialized fields of a LocalDate object).  Jackson 2.12 no longer allows that.  I've updated the test to instead expect the new failure message.  Is this an acceptable change in default behavior?\r\n\r\nPerhaps better would be to start including the jsr310 jar in the shipping product, instead of as test-runtime-only dependency, so that date formatting always displays *something* out-of-the-box?  LocalDate is a built-in type in JDK8 and the only reason Jackson breaks it out as a separate module is for JDK7 compatibility of jackson-core.  But since Geode is minimum JDK8, perhaps it makes us look bad if we don't support standard JDK8 date/time types...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/770501970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/770988583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5637#issuecomment-770988583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5637","id":770988583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MDk4ODU4Mw==","user":{"login":"masaki-yamakawa","id":26367610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY3NjEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26367610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa","html_url":"https://github.com/masaki-yamakawa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masaki-yamakawa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-01T16:38:13Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T16:38:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@agingade \r\nThanks for your comment.\r\n\r\nI am using \"Peer-to-Peer Configuration\" to build the application.
