This looks like a good start for examples. I have a few comments below.\n1. Did you look into using the gradle application plugin, rather than writing a custom run task?\n2. We'll need to verify that the gradle wrapper jar doesn't become part of the source distribution. I guess we need to do the same thing with this gradle wrapper jar that we did at the top level of the project.\n3. I wonder if this ShellUtil class should be put into some common utility project for these example tests. \n4. I  see a problem with the ShellUtil code; it's not consuming the output of the process. Especially on windows this can cause bizarre hangs because the process will block trying to write to stdout. Also it makes it really hard to debug failures if you all you do is assert that the status is 0 but don't provide the output of the process. The code should probably include the process output in the error message if the process returns a non-zero exit.\n5. 'geode-examples/_/scripts/_*' should not be excluded from rat.\n6. How should we integrate this with the rest of the geode build? I think these examples should probably get shipped as part of the source and binary distributions, and the the examples should be built and tested as part of precheckin.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/227528370/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/227616737","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/169#issuecomment-227616737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/169","id":227616737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzYxNjczNw==","user":{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-22T01:09:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T01:09:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/227616737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/228398322","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/173#issuecomment-228398322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/173","id":228398322,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODM5ODMyMg==","user":{"login":"davebarnes97","id":13138489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTM4NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13138489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97","html_url":"https://github.com/davebarnes97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebarnes97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T16:48:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T16:48:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/228398322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/228447918","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/169#issuecomment-228447918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/169","id":228447918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODQ0NzkxOA==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T20:00:15Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T20:00:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Changes

You're adding getDefinedIndexes to the public API, but it returns LuceneIndexCreationProfile objects which is an internal class. Looking at LuceneIndexCreationProfile, I think these methods probably don't belong on LuceneService. Maybe put these methods on InternalLuceneService?\n\nI think setFieldAnalyzerStrings is not a good name, because it's not actually setting anything on the object. Same with setFieldAnalyzerStringsFromProfile.\n\nThe boolean \"status\" field in in LuceneIndexDetails is confusing - what does true or false mean? Maybe it should be named initialized?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/235344965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/235392321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/218#issuecomment-235392321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/218","id":235392321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTM5MjMyMQ==","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-26T20:20:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T20:44:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the pull request Avinash!
