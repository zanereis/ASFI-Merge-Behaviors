The implementation of the setter method doesn't follow convention, however, and although it worked anyway with SQLAlchemy < 1.1.15, it no longer does with SQLAlchemy 1.2.0. Because the SQLAlchemy version requirement in the latest release of Airflow just grabs the most recent release, the `password` setter method will not work in environments where Airflow was installed after 2017-12-27 (when SQLAlchemy 1.2.0 was release) unless the SQLAlchemy requirement is overridden or an older version has been otherwise installed.\r\n\r\n#2955 fixes the setter method that no longer works in SQLAlchemy 1.2, but there are other conflicts between the latest release of flask-admin and SQLAlchemy 1.2 that cause some failures in Airflow's test suite. https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/pull/1586 (which has been merged) will hopefully resolve the other failures with #2955, but not until there's a new release of flask-admin, and it's been over a year now since that project's latest release... :pensive: \r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, though, https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/5e4d7d8d7da250cacc15d8a2247098f0b42a3def pins `sqlalchemy>=1.1.15,<1.2.0`, so whenever it gets into a new Airflow release, the problematic setter method should stop being broken, and we won't have to tell users that they need to modify a non-public attribute.\r\n\r\nSo, since we've got a fix in place for incompatibilities with 1.2.0 on master and a PR to fix this particular problem once other dependency conflicts with 1.2.0 are resolved, should this PR be closed?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/377028581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/377039808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3170#issuecomment-377039808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3170","id":377039808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzAzOTgwOA==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T21:17:01Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T21:17:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @q2w.

This fixes an issue with Amazon Redshift timing out. Redshift is a fork of Postgres so shares the hook. \r\n\r\nRe your error, that SQL looks strange, you are using \"lists.id\" in a join, \"lists\" looks like a table alias which is not declared. Or is this an array type column? If so I wouldn't recommend joining to it, hard to index those, might explain why it is long running.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see more in the logging you can start Airflow with DEBUG level logging. I suggest trying a smaller, shorting running version of the query and checking that the connection to gcs is working. You can also check logs on Postgres.
