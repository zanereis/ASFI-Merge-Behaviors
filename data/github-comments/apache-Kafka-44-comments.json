Yes, using a common admin client that takes care of this will help.\"\nYes a NetworkClient to send requests to broker\n\n\"Let broker to the authentication.\"\nonce we move these requests to broker all kafka-acls need to is to grab the user credentials like consumer,producer do and send a request to kafka broker for add/remove acls. whats catch 22 here?\n\n\"Honestly, I do not see a reason for expecting that authorizer should trust kafka for deciding if it should let a user to perform CRUD on privileges, etc. One might say, we should restrict these operations to kafka's admin user only, which will take care of the issue of authorizing users via authorizer before allowing/denying their request of CRUD ops. For that just imagine you have to go to your admin every time you have to perform chmod/chown on topics you have created, even to see perms as part of your ls command.\"\n1. What you mean by authorizer trusting kafka for deciding a user can perform admin actions or not.\n   1.1 it already does by authorizing kafka authenticated user for all the other requests.\n2. Admins can be determined by a config in kafka server.properties like super.users\n3. If that's not convenient enough  admin can add additional users as \"admin\" into authorizer store using kafka-acls.sh or to give additional permissions to selected users using the same interface. \n4. As @Parth-Brahmbhatt pointed out if you have edit acl on a topic you can today add or remove acls for that topic as well.\n\nThe proposal we are making instead of the proposed changes in this PR is lets use the client/broker authentication which we already have to establish a session and authorize that session like we are doing for writes and reads from clients already. \n\n\"kafka-acls.sh gets and passes user info directly to authorizer. This does not require waiting on KIP-4, however this is probably not a long term solution. \"\nSince this is not a long term solution and we already have temporary solution which is to trust zookeeper acls and authentication. \n\nIdeally all the requests and authorization should happen in kafka broker. We shouldn't be adding another authentication layer to authorizer and have another session. \nLets have proper fix which is to move these requests to broker side and if this is getting delayed by KIP-4 we can file another jira to address authorizer specific requests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/185473951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/185488085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/704#issuecomment-185488085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/704","id":185488085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTQ4ODA4NQ==","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T01:04:50Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T01:04:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased

The problem is it collides with the existing signature that accepts a default Object with no validator.\n\n``` scala\npublic ConfigDef define(String name, Type type, Object defaultValue, Importance importance, String documentation)\n...\npublic ConfigDef define(String name, Type type, Validator validator, Importance importance, String documentation)\n```\n\nPerhaps a fix utilizing `ConfigDef.NO_DEFAULT_VALUE`  could work. It would need to be made public. Then the validator check that was removed could be changed to:\n\n``` scala\nif (this.validator != null && this.hasDefault())\n  this.validator.ensureValid(name, defaultValue);\n```\n\nThe reason I am not a fan of the existing change is that `null` really isn't a valid default, and if a default is defined, it is assumed that the parameter is not required and whatever is set should be valid in the provided validator. The provided default of null will also be printed in the generated docs output and sorted as if it not required.

It's useful to cleanup offsets on deleted topics. As @hachikuji mentioned, we can't drive the offset deletion off StopReplicaRequests. The main reason is that StopReplicaRequests are only sent to brokers that owns a replica of the deleted topic. However, the offsets are stored based on the internal offset topic and they may be stored on completely different brokers. The second reason is that we also send StopReplicaRequest when we move replicas to different brokers. In this case, the topic is still valid and we don't want to delete the offsets.\n\nWhen a topic is deleted, the controller sends an UpdateMetadataRequest to every broker with leader set to LeaderDuringDelete. In MetadataCache.updateCache(), you will see the logic of removing the topic metadata when we see LeaderDuringDelete. This will be the right place to add the logic for deleting offsets.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/186458653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/186460206","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/533#issuecomment-186460206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/533","id":186460206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjQ2MDIwNg==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-20T00:00:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-20T00:00:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the review @harshach, I addressed your comment and rebased on trunk.
