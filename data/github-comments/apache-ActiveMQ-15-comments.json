If you guide me a little bit I can try to create the tests that may be missing.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1813057950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/comments/1813360406","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/1120#issuecomment-1813360406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/activemq/issues/1120","id":1813360406,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmM85sFa8W","user":{"login":"mattrpav","id":512119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav","html_url":"https://github.com/mattrpav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattrpav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-15T22:26:17Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T22:26:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lionelraymundi jetty realm is merged into a single JAAS realm in 6.x.
