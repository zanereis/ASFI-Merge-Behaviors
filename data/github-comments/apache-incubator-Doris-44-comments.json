with you that SegmentV1 will be deprecated in the future, segment V2 will replace all segment v1 in the future.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not Insisting on maintaining SegmentV1 but to be compatible with older doris version.\r\n\r\nFor new doris user , This PR doesn't take any effect, all newer table will be created by segment v2\r\n\r\nFor older doris user, there are many tables with segment v1, and it need to gradually change V1 to v2,\r\nactually, for many older doris user, the most important thing is stable on production enviroment, but now, Very few alter operations succeed, most fail due to timeout, because convert v1 to v2 is a huge task which would cost a lot of time while there are many tablets in older table. and once timeout,  all operations that convert v1 to v2 would rollback, which is not what we expect, and make doris not friendly to older user\r\n\r\nIf we always alter table failed,  it is meanless to  convert v1 to v2 when do alter table, I think it is not a good idea to convert v1 to v2 when user just want to add column for table, which now seems an impossible goal to
