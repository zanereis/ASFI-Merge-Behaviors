My suggestion:\r\n- Keep DirectByteBufferOutputStream#close empty\r\n- Remove DirectByteBufferOutputStream#release\r\n- Change from DirectByteBufferOutputStream#getDirectByteBufferList to DirectByteBufferOutputStream#getMemoryChunkList\r\n- In SerializedPartition#release, replace DirectByteBufferOutputStream#release with the direct invocation of memoryPoolAssigner.returnChunksToPool(dataList), and remove the offheap flag if possible. (Also using the \"!committed\" checker here to ensure that dataList is available would be nice)\r\n- In DirectByteBufferOutputStreamTest, remove all invocations of DirectByteBufferOutputStream#release, and create a separate test for MemoryPoolAssigner instead if needed\r\n\r\n================================\r\nHere is why.\r\n\r\nByteArrayOutputStream, which is part of the Java API, has the following methods\r\n- toByteArray(): returns a copy of the inner byte[]\r\n- close(): does nothing (empty)\r\n\r\nI think the common pattern for using this class is:\r\n1. instantiate a new object as a local variable, and write\r\n2. toByteArray(): obtain a copied byte[]\r\n3. close() (explicitly or by try-with-resources)\r\n4. the local variable goes out of scope (the inner byte[] is garbage collected)\r\n5. The copied byte[] is garbage collected independently (perhaps after inner byte[] is garbage collected)\r\n\r\nI think it is good to use DirectByteBufferOutputStream similarly, although our class shares the same underlying byte[] rather than copying it. This is how we're using this class at the moment.\r\n1. Instantiate a new object as a class-level variable, and write\r\n2. getDirectByteBufferList(): obtain ByteBufferList that points to the inner byte[]\r\n3. close() (explicitly or by try-with-resources)\r\n4. We now have two pointers to the same data: (1) the DirectByteBufferOutputStream variable, and (2) ByteBufferList \r\n5. release() on the stream\r\n6.

you might have realized, there have been quite a lot of changes in the PR compared with it first raised.\r\n\r\nThe changes mostly include how we dispatch tasks to LambdaExecutorRepresenter, and how do we deal with the default executors.\r\n\r\nThe design change was due to the detriment of previous plan, that we forgot to switch off containers for default executors --- those containers were still used for messaging and task state manipulation by TaskStateManager and PlanStateManager.\r\n\r\nThe new design bypasses the container initialization part, especially [AllocatedEvaluatorHandler](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/blob/master/runtime/driver/src/main/java/org/apache/nemo/driver/NemoDriver.java#L159) and [ActiveContextHandler](https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo/blob/master/runtime/driver/src/main/java/org/apache/nemo/driver/NemoDriver.java#L171). \r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to read the JIRA issue
