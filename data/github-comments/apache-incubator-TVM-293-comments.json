I found a bug in `ReduceInferCorrectLayout`, where `exclude` parameter is not taken account when deciding the new reduction axes after layout transform. Moreover, `ReduceInferCorrectLayout` assumes that the number of inputs to a reduction op is 1, which is not the case for `variance` op (it takes `data` and `mean` inputs). Both are fixed and all tests now pass.

When the new layout is \"NCHWc\", rather than computing reduction over \"NCHWc\" layout directly, `ReduceInferCorrectLayout` inserts a conversion \"NCHWc -> NCHW\" before reduction, and reduction is always done in NCHW (see Animesh's comment in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4059/files#r332704381 and the test added in 4059). So when compiling efficientnet v2 for x86, I still get many \"NCHWc -> NCHW\" conversions.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that prevents reducing over `NCHWc` layout (transforming axes = [1] to axes = [1, 4], for example). The only disadvantage would be when reduction is over H and W dimensions, doing reduction over `NCHWc` layout may be slower. What do you think? If this sounds good, I can follow up with another PR.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/927116431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/927131560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9115#issuecomment-927131560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9115","id":927131560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43Queo","user":{"login":"Hzfengsy","id":25500082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTAwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25500082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy","html_url":"https://github.com/Hzfengsy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-25T14:47:32Z","updated_at":"2021-09-25T14:47:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"cc @tqchen @junrushao1994 @tkonolige ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/927131560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/927145018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9048#issuecomment-927145018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9048","id":927145018,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43Qxw6","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-25T16:27:09Z","updated_at":"2021-09-25T16:27:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wasn't involved in that PR so I'm not really sure the root cause of that decision, but what you described makes sense to me.

Hi. I took a second look at this change and tested it on a RT 1050 EVK board. It looks good.

\r\n\r\nIt feels like a wrong solution to a valid problem. The objection would be for mainly two reasons as follows : \r\n\r\n1) The round-robin assignment could miss out interested reviewers. Giving everyone (who have working and contributed the specific component) the opportunity for review, IMO, should be the fair solution. \r\n\r\nIf the problem is that the granularity is too coarse, the actual action might have been make the CODEOWNERS bit more specific. It would be interesting to know why the committers are getting pinged for far too many pull requests between (a) there are lot of activity going on the specific component the committer owning vs (b) there is lot of activity going on many components that are grouped to a single bucket where committers may not necessarily be interested in. Are we sure its (a) ? \r\n\r\n2) I feel picking two reviewers per PR makes it bit non-voluntary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/927981725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928023086","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9057#issuecomment-928023086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9057","id":928023086,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43UIIu","user":{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T16:05:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T16:05:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"-1\r\n\r\nI think we should try other measures before an enforced round-robin, such as:\r\n- tuning the list of maintainers in a more detailed way, with perhaps less people per directory so that lots of people don't get e-mails for simple reviews\r\n- providing more guidance to incentive smaller, incremental patches, which won't touch many areas of the code at once, therefore reaching out to less reviewers\r\n\r\nOther points:\r\n\r\n1. If people feel like they are getting too many *e-mails* for reviews, GitHub e-mails are very descriptive, and people can filter them easily i.e. there is always the reason on why you're getting involved such as \"Review requested\" (the ones added automatically), \"Mention\" (if you're quoted by name), \"Comment\" (on the threads you comment).\r\n\r\n2. How to match automatic assignment with the time people can dedicate to reviews, which can be variable in different periods of the year (holidays, deadlines, other priorities, personal, etc...). On this point, I think it would be fair to have a documented way for people to decline assigned reviews without necessarily specifying a reason.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928023086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928062789","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9132#issuecomment-928062789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9132","id":928062789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43UR1F","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T16:46:16Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T16:46:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zxybazh please fix the lint :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928062789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928076691","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8845#issuecomment-928076691","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8845","id":928076691,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43UVOT","user":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T17:04:53Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T17:04:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @alter-xp @AndrewZhaoLuo @vinx13 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928076691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928083009","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9061#issuecomment-928083009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9061","id":928083009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43UWxB","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T17:12:05Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T17:12:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey thanks guys for the discussion!

@AndrewZhaoLuo @mbrookhart \r\nThanks for reviewing this PR.  \r\n1. PaddlePaddle now provides [English document](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/documentation/docs/en/guides/index_en.html) for API ,  there's no document describe operators, we are supporting this operators mostly by refer to its cpp code or test code, like [crop_op.h](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/paddle/fluid/operators/crop_op.h) or [test_crop_tensor.py](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/python/paddle/fluid/tests/unittests/test_crop_tensor_op.py), but I think it's necessary to provide such documents, I'll try to push this within the PaddlePaddle team in the next quarter. For now, if you have any question about the operators, just comment in this pr, I'll try to  make explanation here.\r\n2. Like other framework, PaddlePaddle has needs to upgrade operators, this will add or delete some parameters for the operator, and also bring a new operator name, like `squeeze2` or `multiclass_nms3`. Currently, we create a convert function for all the different versions of operator, but different versions of operator are both list in the `_convert_map`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928658093/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/928706536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7470#issuecomment-928706536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7470","id":928706536,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBDeBdM43Wu_o","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T03:22:54Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T03:22:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is not reproducible on my end and I haven't seen it in CI jobs.
