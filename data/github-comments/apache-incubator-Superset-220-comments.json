Wouldn't people no want all the junk in their image, and add a layer on top with just what they need/want? Your extra layer would add something like `RUN pip install superset[hive]` (leveraging the `extras_require` ideally). Or maybe there's a lean superset docker, and a fat one with all dependencies you may ever want that's based on that lean image.\r\n\r\nI was also wondering how this file was generated, it appears to be `pip-compile` but the command at the top got removed(?). Anyhow it should be reproducible so that every time `setup.py` changes, there's a clear process to follow to pip-compile and pin things.\r\n\r\nThere's a hack to get the `extras_require` used in `pip-compile`. https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/331\r\n\r\nWe could have a collection of `requirements.in` files that contain just `-e .` and another that's like `requirements-hive.in` that has `-e .[hive]` and outputs `requirements-hive.txt`, and so on, for each entry in `extras_requires`. Put all of these in a `requirements/` folder as it starts to get messy in the root. Also a small shell script to re-generate all these files... Might be overkill though.

I can understand with a slim docker image reasoning, and people can install required packages on top of it, but over the time I realized that users/people don't want to put much effort in enhancing docker image. My intent of starting a Superset docker image repo is to have one image which can be leveraged for learning/exploration as well as putting the same into the production system. Recently, realized new releases of Superset is getting slimmer(which is good), for example, Flower package is optional now, and I have to install explicitly in later versions of docker image which makes much harder to manage DockerFile. Hence, I want all the packages i.e, mandatory & optional ones in Superset codebase so that it would be easier to install(not for me, for other guys too). Does it make sense?\r\n\r\nYes, the checked-in file created manually, and I like the idea which you proposed for managing the requirements. Several 'requirements.in' files in the 'requirement' folder with the output text files. I will make the changes as per suggestion.

The issue is actually not with this migration, but cefabc8f7d38_increase_size_of_name_column_in_ab_view_.py. The problem is that connections created during the app creation in superset init, (with all the stuff it does to create roles) is never released and the connection holds a metadata lock on ab_view_menu. The cefab.. migration can't run the ALTER until the connection is killed manually. The simplest way I found to fix it is to run the AppBuilder creation within the app context. Then when the context goes out of scope the sessions are released to the pool correctly by the __exit__ event handling, and the migration runs fine.
