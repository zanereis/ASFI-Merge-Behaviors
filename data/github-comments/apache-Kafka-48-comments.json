To answer your question above, it doesn't matter if the read is stale if you're using a conditional set, then the write won't go through if the version isn't the one expected. In the worst case, the broker will have to try it again.\n\nOne thing you can goto reduce the probability of a stale read is to issue a sync request right before the read. This way you'll be forcing all pending updates from the leader to the follower to go through. You can't completely avoid the issue though because you can still have concurrent writes even when syncing.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/193366030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/193367824","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1006#issuecomment-193367824","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1006","id":193367824,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzM2NzgyNA==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T17:50:32Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T17:50:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@fpj Thanks for the follow up and confirmation.
