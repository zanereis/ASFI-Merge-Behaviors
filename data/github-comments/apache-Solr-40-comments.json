These subclasses merely need to implement a `getWeightedNodes()` method, which returns a mapping from `Node` to `WeightedNode`. Each plugin makes its own implementation of `WeightedNode`, because the \"weighting\" is determined by what that plugin wants to prioritize when making selections.\r\n\r\nThe `WeightedNode` abstract class has become a bit bloated, but basically it allows a Node to keep track of a state, and make an overall \"weight\" for that node with the given state. (It also has a method to project relevant weight with a given replica added, that's what used for `computePlacements()`).\r\n\r\nI'm sure I need to do a lot more explanation, but in general, the given plugins should work almost exactly as they do today, with the added benefit of having `computeBalancing()` come for \"free\". (though I'm sure the implementation of that shared method can be improved with time)\r\n\r\nThis OrderedNodePlacementPlugin is just a class that the existing PlacementPlugins extend, so it is back-compat with custom plugins. We should mark the class expirimental for 9.x, so that we can make improvements to OrderedNodePlacementPlugin without having to worry about back-compat guarantees while we are improving these APIs.

This is why we needed the `WeightedNode.addReplica()` to return a boolean if other nodes might have lower weights after the addition. The `computePlacement()` logic is perfectly fine for other nodes to have their weights increased silently, since we check if their weight is out-of-date when picking the lowest weight. However nodes that silently have their weights decreased will not be at the front of the priorityQueue, to have their weights re-checked and computed. So the \"entire\" list needs to be re-sorted.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is ok in `computePlacements()` because it is only looking for nodes with the lowest weights. For `computeBalancing()` it's using a TreeSet to find nodes with the lowest and highest weights. Therefore, any other nodes having their weights silently change (via a different node using `addReplica()` or `removeReplica()`) need to be resorted if their weight goes up or down, for optimal placement. Currently we don't do this, because it would likely slow down the computation massively for the affinityPlugin when using `spreadDomain` or `availabilityZone`. Since for every placement, `x` or `n - x` nodes would have to be resorted.\r\n\r\nSo in the meantime the balancing will be good, but it won't be optimal (likely). The `computeBalancing()` loop will continue until there are no replicas that can be moved around to make weighting more optimized, so maybe I'm over thinking this anyways...\r\n\r\nAnyways, I think this is a fine concession to get the feature in Solr. And it's something we can make incremental improvements on in the future. (This is also why I left a `@lucene.experimental` tag on `WeightedNode`. The improvements we make might need different method signatures, like I had to make `addReplica()` return a boolean to make `computePlacements` optimal.)\r\n\r\nI'll add comments to the `computeBalancing()` method to make this clear to future people wanting to work on the code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1584658161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1584728992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1690#issuecomment-1584728992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1690","id":1584728992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5edQug","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-09T15:02:01Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T15:02:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, it looks like https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1650 has buy-in.

Unfortunately, I think it's too much for me to really understand everything your code does, so I'll add some higher-level comments here instead. I hope they're not too dumb, but if you are, ignore them, if they're useful, good 😄 And of course let me know if you have any additional comments/questions.\r\n\r\n* `OrderedNodePlacementPlugin` changes into its own PR - I don't think so, I think the changes are too tightly integrated and it will make things even harder to grok. It looks like that's the direction this PR is going towards anyway 🙂 \r\n* I saw a \"parallel\" flag, but I think replicas are moved one at a time, correct? If so, it will likely prove to be a bottleneck down the road. Some ideas to fix it (maybe in a separate PR):\r\n** Allow rebalancing to happen in parallel for movements where the source AND the destination node are not on the list of source/destination nodes that are already participating in rebalancing. I would say this is pretty safe to do, because if one allows/triggers rebalancing, one would assume there's this extra load that can happen on any node\r\n** Go for the Elasticsearch route and limit the number of concurrent rebalancing AND the number of concurrent incoming/outgoing rebalances per node. The problem is, IMO, with network throughput used by replication. AFAIK, in Solr you can limit it per core instead of the whole node, one has to keep that in mind to make sure rebalancing doesn't choke the network\r\n* Am I reading the code right that we compute all the shard movements that have to be done, then do them all, then check if we were successful? That seems a little bit risky because, if rebalancing takes a long time, changes can happen in the cluster (e.g. node added/failed, new collections added/removed...) so I guess one would have to cancel the rebalancing call and try again. I think the current approach has some advantages, but I have a feeling that if a call would just move one shard at a time (or N in parallel), then come back to see what's the next best thing, etc. it would be safer (and play nicer with the Operator loop, too). I'm thinking again of Elasticsearch (because all I have is a hammer 😅 ) and how it doesn't rebalance more stuff until all recoveries are done. Meaning that if a node went down, something/someone (kubernetes or human operator) could decide to stop the rebalance, replace the node, then resume. I hope I'm not way off here 🙈 \r\n* I saw a `maxBalanceSkew` property, but I'm not really sure what it does. Is this the number of \"weight points\" difference between nodes under which we say \"don't bother?\" And that would be different based on the placement plugin?\r\n* The balancing code that I saw for the Simple placement plugin seems more complicated than the `minimizeCores` one. In Affinity, we don't seem to really deal with the `withCollection` case, in the sense that we would probably want to move shards of both collections at the same time - we check if the destination node has that collection, correct? Anyway, this is not meant to be criticism, just to \"sell\" the crazy idea of having existing placement plugins **not** implement rebalancing and just have new ones, like:\r\n** the Simple plugin as you've just implemented it (with a different name)\r\n** the minimizeCores plugins as it is? Or maybe this is simple enough to simply remain as you extended it now?\r\n** with the Affinity plugin, starting from scratch would avoid dealing (at least initially) with edge cases like `withCollection` or maybe even replica types.\r\n* Do I get it right that we soft-enforce constraints like AZ-awareness by adding big weights? If so, would it be better down the road to add them as constraints? Maybe in `canAddReplica`? This way we only make balancing moves that are \"legal\", e.g. not to have two copies of the same shard in the same AZ or on the same node, or if the node has too little space, etc. Maybe down the road we can add other constraints. One that I find really useful is the total number of shards in a collection in a node: if the cluster shrinks below a size, I prefer not to choke existing nodes with more replicas and create a domino effect.\r\n\r\nThis last bit on \"total shards per collection per node\" isn't really about rebalancing, but about placing a new - e.g. recovered - replica. But now that we're in the realm of placement plugins, we might as well use weights for \"placing\" replicas in other contexts. And I think your PR already does that, no? If I simply create a new replica, the placement plugin will put it on the node with the lowest weight, correct?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1587759700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1587870428","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1704#issuecomment-1587870428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1704","id":1587870428,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5epPrc","user":{"login":"mlbiscoc","id":54160956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTYwOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54160956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc","html_url":"https://github.com/mlbiscoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlbiscoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-12T18:34:40Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T18:34:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gerlowskija Could you take a look at this PR when you get a chance?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1587870428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1588135823","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1650#issuecomment-1588135823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1650","id":1588135823,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5eqQeP","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-12T21:31:31Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T21:31:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the review Radu!\r\n\r\n> I saw a \"parallel\" flag, but I think replicas are moved one at a time, correct? If so, it will likely prove to be a bottleneck down the road.\r\n\r\nThe replicas will be moved in parallel, but in the future we definitely should add a bottleneck option here. That's a great call-out. Separate PR IMO.\r\n\r\n> Am I reading the code right that we compute all the shard movements that have to be done, then do them all, then check if we were successful?\r\n\r\nYes, that is correct. And this is also a good future edition I think. We can limit the balanceReplicas logic to `x` movements, then implement those movements then wait for the cluster to become healthy. We could do that logic in a loop until 0 movements are returned. Also a separate PR, but I love the idea.\r\n\r\n> I saw a maxBalanceSkew property, but I'm not really sure what it does. Is this the number of \"weight points\" difference between nodes under which we say \"don't bother?\" And that would be different based on the placement plugin?\r\n\r\nCurrently it does absolutely nothing, but yes, the idea is that you move things around until the difference between the lowest weight and the highest weight is <= `maxBalanceSkew`. I didn't implement it yet, because I'm not sure how useful it would be honestly... I was also thinking originally that it would return an error if the maxBalanceSkew couldn't be achieved, but once again I'm not convinced of a use case here. I should remove it for now, since it is unused.\r\n\r\n> The balancing code that I saw for the Simple placement plugin seems more complicated than the minimizeCores one.\r\n\r\nYeah, simple is more complex than minimizeCores. It was the Legacy implementation, but the name \"Simple\" was chosen over \"Legacy\".\r\n\r\n> In Affinity, we don't seem to really deal with the withCollection case, in the sense that we would probably want to move shards of both collections at the same time - we check if the destination node has that collection, correct?\r\n\r\nThat is correct. It makes sure that a move works with the existing replicas, but it is not yet smart enough to move replicas together. I have ideas on how to improve this down the line, but I don't think its necessary for the first implementation.\r\n\r\nBasically for `canRemoveReplica(r)`, it would return the list of other replicas that would need to be removed along with that replica, and `canAddReplica(r)`, it would return the list of other replicas that would need to be added along with that replica. Then the orderedNode logic could make it work. Once again, this adds some complexity, and it can likely wait for another PR.\r\n\r\n> Do I get it right that we soft-enforce constraints like AZ-awareness by adding big weights? If so, would it be better down the road to add them as constraints?\r\n\r\nSo yeah, they can absolutely be used as constraints, but right now (before this PR) they aren't, so this logic is keeping in-line with the logic that existed before.\r\n\r\n> And I think your PR already does that, no? If I simply create a new replica, the placement plugin will put it on the node with the lowest weight, correct?\r\n\r\nThis is correct, and we can definitely add new constraints (like shardsPerNode/replicasPerNode) to the different PlacementPlugins. It will be especially easy to do given this new framework going forward!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1588135823/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1589600650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1611#issuecomment-1589600650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1611","id":1589600650,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5ev2GK","user":{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-13T16:00:15Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T16:00:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This might supercede https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1522","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1589600650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1589689966","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/1650#issuecomment-1589689966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/1650","id":1589689966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM5ewL5u","user":{"login":"HoustonPutman","id":3376422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzY0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3376422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman","html_url":"https://github.com/HoustonPutman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HoustonPutman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-13T16:54:45Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T16:54:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added tests and docs for the new API.
