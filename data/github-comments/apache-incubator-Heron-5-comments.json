Heron root itself\n2. Heron Java (heron/heron)\n3. Heron 3rd party\n\nthe benefits are that you dont have to whitelist every folder and file under heron root\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4031715/14623252/4db64fa8-0585-11e6-9b1c-edbcb03f43f6.png)\n\npro's , all files under heron workspace is managed and no out of band process required for top level additions\ncons : the file naming structure is not logical today.. heron root is named heron. heron java is named heron, resulting in a lot of confusion \n\nOption 2:\nexplicitly include every folder under heron root as a content root. the benefit is a more natural organization, where everything appears to be logically below the heron root . however , in order to do this , every folder needs to be explicitly listed as a content root in the IML., which means addition of a new folder at the top level requires a run of setup intellij. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4031715/14623429/f4c06e0e-0586-11e6-8bc4-5e93330c1a40.png)\n\nnot sure if I articulated this well - so please let know if the options are clear . if they are , please advice.\n\nThanks\nprabhu\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/211639334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/211678613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/368#issuecomment-211678613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/368","id":211678613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTY3ODYxMw==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T01:47:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T01:47:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"üëç
