before and after this PR, there's two ways to construct a MapElements or FlatMapElements:\r\n1. Construct from SerializableFunction and a TypeDescriptor\r\n2. Construct from a SimpleFunction (which has its own TypeDescriptor)\r\n\r\nIn both cases, internally the transform stores the SimpleFunction, but in case 2 it just uses what the user gave directly, and in case 1 it instead constructs the SimpleFunction from the SerializableFunction and the TypeDescriptor.\r\n\r\nThis PR leaves case 2 unchanged - static `via(SimpleFunction)`.\r\nIt syntactically changes case 1 from `.via(SerializableFunction).withOutputType(TypeDescriptor)` into `.into(TypeDescriptor).via(SerializableFunction)`, with the sole motivation of getting rid of the ugly and user-visible intermediate class. The TypeDescriptor private field is used only as an intermediate storage to put the TypeDescriptor supplied in .into() in order to combine it into the SimpleFunction when you finish application with .via().\r\n\r\nThere's no semantic changes, or changes in quality of type inference in this PR, and I would like to keep it this way.\r\n\r\nI think this addresses all your comments - let me know if anything remains unclear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/293062762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/293069246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2459#issuecomment-293069246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2459","id":293069246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzA2OTI0Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-10T20:29:14Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T20:29:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer to this link for build results (access rights to CI server needed): \nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/9365/<h2>Build result: FAILURE</span></h2>[...truncated 808.64 KB...]\tat hudson.remoting.UserRequest.perform(UserRequest.java:153)\tat hudson.remoting.UserRequest.perform(UserRequest.java:50)\tat hudson.remoting.Request$2.run(Request.java:336)\tat hudson.remoting.InterceptingExecutorService$1.call(InterceptingExecutorService.java:68)\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)Caused by: org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: Dependency problems found\tat org.apache.maven.plugins.dependency.analyze.AbstractAnalyzeMojo.execute(AbstractAnalyzeMojo.java:261)\tat org.apache.maven.plugin.DefaultBuildPluginManager.executeMojo(DefaultBuildPluginManager.java:134)\tat org.apache.maven.lifecycle.internal.MojoExecutor.execute(MojoExecutor.java:208)\t... 31 more2017-04-10T20:29:02.128 [ERROR] 2017-04-10T20:29:02.128 [ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.2017-04-10T20:29:02.128 [ERROR] 2017-04-10T20:29:02.128 [ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:2017-04-10T20:29:02.129 [ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException2017-04-10T20:29:02.129 [ERROR] 2017-04-10T20:29:02.129 [ERROR] After correcting the problems, you can resume the build with the command2017-04-10T20:29:02.130 [ERROR]   mvn <goals> -rf :beam-runners-core-construction-javachannel stoppedSetting status of e46df615f881d17e2e7492f6ff92d9f911a1968a to FAILURE with url https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_MavenInstall/9365/ and message: 'Build finished.

question, based on existing usage of `BasicDataSource`, \r\n1. the only source to be collected in `close` is `MBeanServer`;\r\n2. It has 0 initial connection, and one `getConenction` for once, so no idle connections should be there. \r\n\r\nI remember DoFn may be reused, correct me if not, it's worth to do a clean up  for 1#. \r\n\r\nThe more concern one for me is still `DataSourceConfiguration.create(dataSource)`.  I may re-implement this patch, to force `extend AutoCloseable`. That would make the code clear.
