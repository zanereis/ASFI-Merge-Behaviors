The constructors are used only when enqueueing to the pendingTasklets internally.\n- I found that tests failed because of unused import. In the console, we can see the following messages\n\n```\n[ERROR] src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\reef\\tests\\applications\\vortex\\addone\\AddOneTest.java:[25,8] (imports) UnusedImports: Unused import - org.apache.reef.vortex.api.VortexFuture.\n```\n\nThis is because `VortexFunction` is imported for javadoc `{@link VortexFunction}`, but not used actually.

instead of `EventHandler`, we can use [`Observer`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-reef/blob/master/lang/java/reef-wake/wake/src/main/java/org/apache/reef/wake/rx/Observer.java) for the callback instead, and invoke `onError` on `Exceptions`.

The basic pattern is to create an empty Tang injector, that creates a new instance. This gets us away from using public constructors, but it doesn't remove the underlying dependencies.\n\nThe code remains brittle. For example, let's say a constructor for the DefaultRemoteManagerImplementation is added that uses a new named parameter. If the Factory class wants to use this, an extra bindVolatileParameter has to be added anyway.\n\nIt also adds one more source of brittleness. The compiler can't check if the binded instances are enough to create an instance of DefaultRemoteManagerImplementation. Using public constructors at least allows the compiler to check if the passed in instances are the correct arguments for a constructor.\n\nThat being said, I don't have a great alternative. The best I can come up with is: make the RemoteManagerImplementation constructors package-private, and un-deprecate them. This removes exposure to clients without resorting to dynamic injection.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/159782766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/159787815","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/679#issuecomment-159787815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/679","id":159787815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTc4NzgxNQ==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-26T02:48:41Z","updated_at":"2015-11-26T02:48:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is not meant to be a permanent fix, as I mentioned above, but rather a hotfix such that our build doesn't break anymore.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/159787815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/159805799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/679#issuecomment-159805799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/679","id":159805799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTgwNTc5OQ==","user":{"login":"afchung","id":2817619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTc2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung","html_url":"https://github.com/afchung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afchung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-26T04:59:55Z","updated_at":"2015-11-26T04:59:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jwang98052 Actually, I think I was able to fix it properly.
