It's not a trivial problem :)\n\nI have two general comments:\n- I would prefer to see this as library method instead of an example. As an example, it shows how to use neighborhood methods, joinWithVertices and getTriplets, but we already have the JaccardSimilarity for all of these.\n- The algorithm is actually very hard to scale. It essentially requires common neighborhood calculation. This is a real pain for large graphs with skewed vertices. @andralungu can explain to you more, since she's been working on optimizing similar problems for her work.\n  An additional problem that this particular implementation has is that it also stores and sends vertex values, not only vertex IDs. If you try to run this with a big graph, it will probably crash or run forever.\n\nThere are 2 things we could do:\n\n1). Only send a list of vertex IDs and let the receiving vertex generate partial sums for each common neighbor. At the end, we can aggregate the sums per edge. For example, consider the edges (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 4) and (2, 4). In the neighborhood method, vertex 3 will find that it has a common neighbor with 1, vertex 2. Then, it will emit a tuple `<1, 2, 1/log(d3)>`. In the same way, vertex 4 will find that it has a common neighbor with 1, vertex 2 and it will emit a tuple `<1, 2, 1/log(d4)>`.\nThe output of the neighborhood method will be a dataset of tuples that represent edges with partial sums. You can then compute the Adamic-Adar similarity by summing up the values per edge.\n\n2). The above solution will be OK for regular graphs, but will still have problems in the presence of skew. Another approach would be to offer an approximate Adamic-Adar similarity, by representing neighborhoods as bloom filters. In this case, the size of common neighborhoods will be over-estimated, but the computation will be faster.\n\n@shghatge, @andralungu, let me know what you think and how you would like to proceed!

As the JIRA did not ask for an approximate version, it was suggested that I create another JIRA issue which will provide a library method for Adamic Adar which gives approximate solution with the use of bloom filters.\nI have a query about the bloom filters. Since bloom filters only tell us whether an element belongs to the set or not, if both the vertices have Bloom filters as value, how will we know what to emit? For Example for Vertex 3 '1,4,13' are set and for Vertex 5 '2,4,13' are set. Now when we use the method suggested by you using logical AND we find out the intersection of the Bloom Filters. After this do you suggest that we keep another hashtable that keeps track of a value->vertex relation? Or do we just emit 5,4,1/log(d3) and keep the hashtable as an identity map function? That would mean each vertex has n number of bits as value , where n is the number of vertices in the graph. I hope I was clear in my query. TL;DR We will have to use an identity hash function which implies that each vertex will need n bits of memory as value. Is it okay to use this much memory? If there is some other approach then please let me know. Bloom filters seem to be more useful in finding size of the intersection or union but here we need to know which Vertices are common. The only other way that I can roughly imagine is that we get the hashed edges in a dataset, just like 5,4,1/(logd3)... Use the same hash function on all the graph edges. Then Join the datasets obtained over field 1 and 2. \nPlease tell me if there is any other efficient way or which one of these two you would

just had a closer look at this PR and it made me seriously question the utility of a `Graph.fromCSV` method. Why? First of all because it's more limited than the regular `env.fromCsv()` in the sense that it does not allow POJOs and it would be a bit tedious to support that. There would be a need for methods with 2 to n fields, according to the amount of attributes present in the POJO. \n\nSecond, because, and I am speaking strictly as a user here, I would rather write:\nprivate static DataSet<Edge<Long, Double>> getEdgesDataSet(ExecutionEnvironment env) {\n\n```\n    if(fileOutput) {\n        return env.readCsvFile(edgeInputPath)\n                .ignoreComments(\"#\")\n                .fieldDelimiter(\"\\t\")\n                .lineDelimiter(\"\\n\")\n                .types(Long.class, Long.class, Double.class)\n                .map(new Tuple3ToEdgeMap<Long, Double>());\n    } else {\n        return CommunityDetectionData.getDefaultEdgeDataSet(env);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthan...\n\nprivate static Graph<Long, Long, Double> getGraph(ExecutionEnvironment env) {\n        Graph<Long, Long, Double> graph;\n        if(!fileOutput) {\n            DataSet<Edge<Long, Double>> edges = CommunityDetectionData.getDefaultEdgeDataSet(env);\n            graph = Graph.fromDataSet(edges,\n                    new MapFunction<Long, Long>() {\n\n```\n                    public Long map(Long label) {\n                        return label;\n                    }\n                }, env);\n    } else {\n        graph = Graph.fromCsvReader(edgeInputPath,new MapFunction<Long, Long>() {\n            public Long map(Long label) {\n                return label;\n            }\n        }, env).ignoreCommentsEdges(\"#\")\n                .fieldDelimiterEdges(\"\\t\")\n                .lineDelimiterEdges(\"\\n\")\n                .typesEdges(Long.class, Double.class)\n                .typesVertices(Long.class, Long.class);\n    }\n    return graph;\n}\n```\n\nMaybe it's just a preference thing... but I believe it's at least worth a discussion. On the other hand, the utility of such a method should have been questioned from its early Jira days, so I guess that's my mistake.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on this. \nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/120856171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/120875478","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/802#issuecomment-120875478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/802","id":120875478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDg3NTQ3OA==","user":{"login":"gaborhermann","id":6912263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTIyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6912263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborhermann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborhermann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-13T09:49:26Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T09:49:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay, thanks :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/120875478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/120913343","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/905#issuecomment-120913343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/905","id":120913343,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMDkxMzM0Mw==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-13T12:37:42Z","updated_at":"2015-07-13T13:00:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, @pp86 Thanks for your contribution.\n\nBut I think that using `AutoSelector` is not the best approach to improve distinct transformation.

However, that's not a problem of `fromCsv()`. The if-block can be easily simplified by changing `getDefaultEdgeDataSet` to `getDefaultGraph`. The else-block looks longer because of the mapper, which, in the current examples is in the main method.\n\nWhat I think is quite problematic, is the `types()` methods. Ideally, we would have the following:\n1. `types(K)` : no vertex value, no edge value\n2. `types(K, VV)`: no edge value\n3. `types(K, EV)`: no vertex value\n4. `types(K, VV, EV)`: both vertex and edge values are present\nHowever, because of type erasure, we can't have both 2 and 3. The current implementation (having separate `typesEdges` and `typesVertices`) means that both should always be called, even if not necessary. Another way would be to give 2 and 3 different names... So far I haven't been able to come up with a nice solution.

Wasn't the rationale to have a separate message for the heartbeat and the accumulators to keep the heartbeat messages small? What do you think? In any case, I agree that it makes sense to be able to configure this.\n\nInitially, that was my proposal but I remember we discussed that we should try to minimize the amount of messages and thus use the `Heartbeat` message. It makes sense to be able to configure the snapshot transferal in multiples of the hearbeat interval. I'd like to fix that in another pull \n\n> I would add a unit test for the record reader/writer accumulator results.\n\nI'll integrate that into the `AccumulatorLiveITCase`.\n\n> There seems to be a 1:1 correspondence between the reporter and the internal metrics. Is the idea to have multiple different reporters in the future (for different types of metrics etc.) or is a long reporter sufficient?\n\nFor now, a long reporter is sufficient but if we discover that we need more customizable reporters, we can easily change the reporter interface in the future (it wouldn't be API
