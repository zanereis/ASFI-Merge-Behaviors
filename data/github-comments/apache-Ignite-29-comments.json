a note for future archeologists: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-6334 mentions Token Bucket algorithm, but in reality this is not what was implemented. In the Token Bucket algorithm, non-complying requests are delayed till they become complying (so, in our case, this would mean wait till the memory resources we protect become available). But in the code, a different approach is used: when the protected resources are scarse, slow down writer threads; in conjunction with a sufficient buffer size, this makes the protection reliable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/969929264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/970192040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/9554#issuecomment-970192040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/9554","id":970192040,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs450_So","user":{"login":"rpuch","id":3244433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDQ0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3244433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch","html_url":"https://github.com/rpuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-16T11:45:56Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T11:45:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vveider thank you for the advice, I will contact Nikita.\r\n\r\n### About special paragraph\r\n\r\nAs for Maven Wrapper specific prerequisites: according to https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper , they should run on JDK 7, while Ignite requires JDK 8 itself, so no problem here. Also, they seem to support any decent `sh` flavour (I mean, Unix-like shells). Apart from this, Maven Wrapper requires Java 8 and `JAVA_HOME` variable set, but this is exactly what is needed for vanilla Maven, so nothing new here.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that we simply do not need to mention anything specific about Maven Wrapper prerequisites: it will just work everywhere where Maven would work. Its usage is also straightforward: you just say `./mvnw` instead of `mvn`, and it transparently works in the same way as for `mvn`, but handles Maven management itself.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, are you sure that we need to have that special paragraph in DEVNOTES?\r\n\r\n### About `./mvnw` spell\r\n\r\nAs for `./mvnw` on different systems, there are two groups.\r\n\r\n * Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS, etc): it works in sh, bash, dash, zsh, so basically 'everywhere'\r\n * Windows. Here we have a zoo! I carried out a quick poll in our Slack channel about Windows users preferences. They named PowerShell, cmd, Idea builtin shell, cygwin, git-bash, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).\r\n   - In PowerShell (Win10), `./mvnw`, `.\\mvnw`, `./mvnw.cmd`, `.\\mvnw.cmd` all work, but `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` do not work with default settings\r\n   - In cmd (Win10), only `.\\mvnw` and `.\\mvnw.cmd` work, while `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` still do not work with default settings\r\n   - In the Maven Wrapper documentation https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper , they mention `mvnw.cmd` spell to invoke it on Windows. This does not seem to work on modern Windows versions, but it probably did in earlier ones. But they also say `mvn` where it clearly should be `./mvnw`, so there is a probability of a mistake in their documentation...\r\n   - In Idea, the built-in shell seems to default to the system default (in my case, it was PowerShell)\r\n   - cygwin, git-bash, WSL all have `bash` in them, so `./mvnw` works\r\n\r\nWith all this, it looks like `./mvnw` should work for *nearly* everyone, but not for all. I could add a paragraph in the beginning of DEVNOTES about this discrepancy, like 'For most users on Unix-like systems and in PowerShell, `./mvnw` will work, so we use `./mvnw` spell everywhere in the docs, but if you use `cmd`, write `\\.mvnw`'.
