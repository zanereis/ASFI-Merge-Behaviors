so after thinking about it a bit more, maybe it's worth experimenting with this simpler approach of in-lining the shaded dependency in our jars using build plug-ins. The main reason I think it's worth trying is that, in the worst case, if this has some random unintended consequence we can just revert to our existing method of publishing fully shaded dependencies to maven central.\n\nOne thought for @vanzin and @srowen - what if instead of having our own copy of Optional, we just continue advertise a full compile dependency on guava and we get Optional from that. Then basically we have a \"public\" use of Gauva which is for this Optional class and a \"private\" use of Guava which we shade away. I think that will work as long as Optional does not change in guava... but that is the exact scenario in which the current approach works as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51564110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51564189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1846#issuecomment-51564189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1846","id":51564189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTY0MTg5","user":{"login":"chenghao-intel","id":2367031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2367031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/chenghao-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenghao-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T05:14:09Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T05:14:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hello, Jenkins, test this please.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51564189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/51564211","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1513#issuecomment-51564211","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1513","id":51564211,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTY0MjEx","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T05:14:30Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T05:14:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA tests have started for PR 1513.
