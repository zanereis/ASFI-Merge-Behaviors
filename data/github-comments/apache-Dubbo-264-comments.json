When new parameters are added, the protobuf schema will be regenerated, which is inconvenient to manage\r\n2. After the file is regenerated, the upstream and downstream interface types also need to be changed, which means manual copying to the upstream and downstream is not convenient for agile development\r\n3. For enterprises, the application is started as a jar package. If you do not maintain the changed version of the protobuf file when you release the version, you will face continuous rollback and re-release, which is very expensive.\r\n\r\nSo we need this management and control platform to support things such as protobuf dynamic generation, file compilation, and publishing to remote warehouse management versions.\r\n\r\nIMO, I don't quite understand what your intent is?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/1369619951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/1369620744","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/11210#issuecomment-1369620744","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11210","id":1369620744,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEfiCM5RosEI","user":{"login":"neighbor-uncleWang","id":39826593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODI2NTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39826593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang","html_url":"https://github.com/neighbor-uncleWang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neighbor-uncleWang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-03T10:44:23Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T10:44:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"插眼","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/1369620744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/1369630375","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/11168#issuecomment-1369630375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11168","id":1369630375,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAEfiCM5Rouan","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-03T10:55:22Z","updated_at":"2023-01-03T10:55:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> hello, many thanks for this fix. is there any chance to release it promptly?
