the less there should be some mechanism to track it so that if a CVE for commons IO does come out somebody looks at it to verify that that CVE has nothing to do with glob matching.

Observation: I don't think we need the concurrent DocSet builder (the one from Netflix). Couldn't we build segment level FixedBitSets (no safety issue) and then at the end combine into a master FixedBitSet so that we have our DocSet? It could even be made to be long-aligned, and thus the final aggregation is just copying longs with System.arraycopy (no doc iteration! or long shifting).

As recreating Http2SolrClient using withHttpClient won't pass on listeners. Basically same issue that we have faced with Executors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1975233648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1976135035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2313#issuecomment-1976135035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2313","id":1976135035,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM51yW17","user":{"login":"tuannh982","id":76271617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjcxNjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76271617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982","html_url":"https://github.com/tuannh982","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuannh982/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-04T09:39:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T09:39:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jdyer1 can you re-review this?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1976135035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1977426115","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2332#issuecomment-1977426115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2332","id":1977426115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM513SDD","user":{"login":"mkhludnev","id":807522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev","html_url":"https://github.com/mkhludnev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkhludnev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-04T20:47:13Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T20:47:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wwang30 what do you think of it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1977426115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1977700604","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2276#issuecomment-1977700604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2276","id":1977700604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM514VD8","user":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-05T00:04:21Z","updated_at":"2024-03-05T00:04:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for digging into the authentication issue further; this is shining a light on an issue I was vaguely aware of but now I can see it directly.

Thus don't have fields on classes that hold an HttpClient (we'll deem this bad/questionable practice); instead hold an Http2SolrClient.  If due to customized timeouts we need a new Http2SolrClient, we could ensure that the builder withHttpClient(http2SolrClient) copies listeners (and anything else like an executor; why not).  That could be its own JIRA.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1977700604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/comments/1977998958","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/solr/pull/2276#issuecomment-1977998958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/solr/issues/2276","id":1977998958,"node_id":"IC_kwDOFFj3yM515d5u","user":{"login":"iamsanjay","id":6595915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTU5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6595915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay","html_url":"https://github.com/iamsanjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamsanjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-05T05:33:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-05T05:33:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"TestPullReplicaWithAuth.testPKIAuthWorksForPullReplication is the one.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, How about we rethink the design decorating the request.

There's an attempt in `CachingDirectoryFactory.closeCacheValue(CacheValue)` to defer deletion of parent paths by [associating them with subpaths that are also tracked](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/cebc10d060ff5fa7b9a52660a02a27c2ed6af1f0/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/CachingDirectoryFactory.java#L255-L269). There are really two problems: one problem occurs when there are _two_ subpaths that match a given parent -- the parent is arbitrarily added to one or the other child, and thus the parent can be deleted before its subpath (defeating the reordering logic).\r\n\r\nThe other problem (the one expect we're actually hitting most of the time) is that for removals that are deferred until core close, there is no removal reordering [upon iteration of CachingDirectoryFactory.removeEntries](https://github.com/apache/solr/blob/cebc10d060ff5fa7b9a52660a02a27c2ed6af1f0/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/core/CachingDirectoryFactory.java#L213-L220) -- this is in arbitrary `HashMap` iteration order, so parent dirs will often be removed before child dirs.
