, there\r\n\r\ntoday I tried several times to test this function. followings are the precodiction :\r\n1. raise up 5 mysql instance and insert 1 million data\r\n2. luanch up a \"brand new\" zk\r\n3. established a proxy with sharding rule\r\n\r\nwhen proxy is start up, I execute a shell like following : \r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash  \r\n  \r\nexport MYSQL_PWD=root\r\n  \r\nfor (( i = 0; i < 10000000;
