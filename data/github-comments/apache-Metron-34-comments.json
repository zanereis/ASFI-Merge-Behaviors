However, I was able to enlarge the elasticsearch values, and I have mocked procedures in the unit test that test the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. Test that flush on batchSize continues to work correctly, without time-based triggers going off.\r\n1. Test that flush occurs on less-than-full queue, when a message comes in and the queue is older than batchTimeout.  (Age of the queue is determined as currentTime() - timeOfEnqueingFirstMsg().)\r\n1. Test that flush occurs on less-than-full queue, when a TickTuple comes in and the queue is older than batchTimeout.\r\n1. Test that default batchTimeout is correctly calculated as (TOPOLOGY_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_SECS / 2 / batchTimeoutDivisor - 1).\r\n1. Test that when default batchTimeout is smaller than configured batchTimeout, that the default is used.\r\n1. Test that when default batchTimeout is greater than configured batchTimeout, that the configured batchTimeout is used.\r\n\r\nAll of the above test cases are tested, with mocked writers and a FakeClock, in the BulkMessageWriterBoltTest unit test file, with the latest commit above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314010240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314016130","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/481#issuecomment-314016130","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/481","id":314016130,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDAxNjEzMA==","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-10T06:23:16Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T06:23:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dlyle65535 , integrated and fixed unit tests as intended, and updated to current master.

Thanks, Ryan.  We desperately need this abstraction.  I think the confusion may be that this PR is the general abstraction as well as a concrete implementation for one index.  I think, as we found with the indexing topology, that solr and ES won't be able to exist within the same project due to classpath issues (note we have 2 separate projects for solr and ES to isolate the dependencies completely).

We need a way for solr and ES to coexist.  A precedent has already been set in our indexing module but just want to throw another suggestion out there.  The downside of having separate modules that extend a common module is that automated deployment through Ambari MPack is more complex.  In fact, the current MPack doesn't support this right now.  \r\n\r\nIdeally we could leverage Spring to easily swap out the implementation at runtime but we would need both Solr and ES classes available on the classpath.  Would it be possible to add lucene classes (and possibly others) to the list of shaded classes in the elasticsearch-shaded module and create a similar module for Solr?

It's possible that someone may want to use a different database and in that case they would want to set this to a blank string.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314571719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314571991","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/646#issuecomment-314571991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/646","id":314571991,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDU3MTk5MQ==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-11T21:06:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T21:06:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That seems like a configuration that is rather confusing... \r\nIs there a way we can clarify that?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314571991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314572258","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/646#issuecomment-314572258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/646","id":314572258,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDU3MjI1OA==","user":{"login":"lvets","id":4215920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTU5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4215920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets","html_url":"https://github.com/lvets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-11T21:07:31Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T21:07:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\"This is needed when configuring MySQL for Metron REST because this property must be '' and not 'mysql'.\".

Maybe we can collaborate on the right approach.\r\n\r\nThe REST app requires a relational database and setting that up is a prerequisite, unless you want to use h2.  We can provide a way to automatically run a script and make this setup easier (we do that for h2 and mysql).  But it's likely that different orgs will want to use their own database and we probably don't want to try and maintain scripts for every possible database out there.\r\n\r\nSo what's the best approach?  Do we:\r\n\r\n- Remove the convenience scripts and document setup as best we can (again providing the exact SQL statements for every database is not feasible).  In this case we would just remove this metron_jdbc_platform property from Ambari because it's not needed anymore.\r\n- Limit our database support to a handful of databases and provide setup scripts for those?  In this case the metron_jdbc_platform could be a dropdown with the databases we support but users would be forced to use one of those.\r\n- Keep it like it is now, provide a convenient way to initialize MySQL with other databases requiring manual setup.  In this case metron_jdbc_platform would accept h2, mysql, or empty meaning the user is responsible for setup.\r\n\r\nEither way, the READMEs need to be improved which probably includes moving this database setup prerequisite to a higher level so that it's more obvious and providing more detail around manual setup.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314591747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314593833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/646#issuecomment-314593833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/646","id":314593833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDU5MzgzMw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-11T22:49:16Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T22:49:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"What do other HDP / ambari configured services do to support multiple databases?

It's too bound-up in the REST layer whereas data access has traditionally existed further down in the abstraction layer.  It's a smell that metron-rest has to depend on ES at all.  That dependency should be provided at runtime entirely.  Also, we're going to need data access in batch as well and I'd like a sensible abstraction in place to enable that (e.g. merging modified records when reading as part of a Spark or MR job).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we need a DAO abstraction living in `metron-writer` or even `metron-indexing` for interacting with indices with the concrete implementations existing in `metron-elasticsearch` and `metron-solr` for ES and Solr respectively.  I think `metron-rest` should work entirely on abstract classes.  The REST layer should choose the DAO implementation via reflection and we should adjust the classpath in the shell script to include one of `metron-elasticsearch` or `metron-solr`.  In essence, I'm recommending something similar to how JDBC works where you choose your driver implementation via reflection (often) and work with base JDBC classes from there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314691741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/314695694","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/636#issuecomment-314695694","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/636","id":314695694,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDY5NTY5NA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-12T08:37:57Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T08:37:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just want to follow-up with something a bit more concrete suggestions.  I think the beginnings of an abstraction are there.  You pulled out a bunch of utility methods from `ElasticsearchWriter` which is good.  I'm looking for a DAO-like abstraction in `metron-elasticsearch` and the `ServiceImpl` in the REST layer uses the generic DAO implementation (which would not live in the REST layer so it's usable for lower level access) and the index impl is specified by at runtime.
