for the feedback @jixuan1989 @neuyilan \r\n\r\nBefore this PR, every small request will be expanded to 16m (I guess Jialin's thinking at that time was to avoid frequent expansion caused by the default value of 64K, and expand to 16m at one time), the resize logic is [here](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/170d6793edd7cfff7971ce66ff8d4b7ed912454b/service-rpc/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb/rpc/TElasticFramedTransport.java#L129) . but the default 16m will also involve frequent capacity reduction, when frequent (5 times +) small requests comings. Therefore, setting the default values of 64K and 16m is a simple trade-off, because the memory consumption will be dynamically adjusted according to the request size and `sizeIfNessessary()`. So for me, the default values 64K and 16m are OK from the design point of view (user also can change this default value) . From the perspective of experience you share and the memory resources of the devices, I agree with default 64K, if you prefer to 64K as default value.\r\n\r\nI appreciate if you can share some thoughts here @qiaojialin  :) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/809845699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/comments/809867950","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/2904#issuecomment-809867950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iotdb/issues/2904","id":809867950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwOTg2Nzk1MA==","user":{"login":"qiaojialin","id":7240743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDA3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7240743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin","html_url":"https://github.com/qiaojialin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qiaojialin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T02:59:37Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T02:59:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, I'm coming... \r\n\r\n> Before this PR, every small request will be expanded to 16m\r\n\r\nThat's right.

@neuyilan \r\n1. I think that the intention of the `if` block in `readFrame()` is shrinking, not expanding. Another call of `resizeIfNecessary()` in `readBuffer.fill()` can also handle the shrinking if we remove this `if` block. \r\n2. It doesn't matter how large the default initial buffer size is, 64KB or 16MB. It will be shrinked or expanded in necessary immediately after the call of `resizeIfNecessary()` in `readBuffer.fill()`. The initial buffer size will also be set via user's configuration.\r\n3. I also believe that the current design, putting shrinking and expanding logics together in `resizeIfNecessary()`, is better than separating them in two methods. Separating them means that we push the responsibility of checking the resizing condition up to the caller. The code will become more complex. However, we need a unified rule for resizing the buffer.\r\n\r\nIf there's any misunderstanding，I'm very glad to receive any feedbacks and details about the design

The original meaning of the `resizeifnecessary` function is that when the size of my request is larger than the size already declared by thrift, I will try to reduce the size; otherwise, I need to expand the size.\r\n\r\n2. If the automatic adjustment is correct, the initial value of 64KB or 16MB is OK, but if the initial setting is too large, some memory will be wasted before the adjustment ends. At present, the reason why all requests become 16MB is that the parameters passed in by calling the function of `resizeifnecessary` are incorrect. The parameter to call the `resizeifnecessary` function should be the size of the request, not `softmaxlength`.  https://github.com/apache/iotdb/blob/master/service-rpc/src/main/java/org/apache/iotdb/rpc/AutoResizingBuffer.java#L50\r\n3.

At present, we have basically reached an agreement. Based on our discussion, The resizeifnecessary maintains the encapsulation shrinkage strategy and is transparent to the caller，and we set the default value to 64KB. We can continue to discuss better contraction strategies, and better improvements can be made by opening separate PR.
