conv?\n@wangg12\nthanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236078483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/236088587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/2326#issuecomment-236088587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2326","id":236088587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjA4ODU4Nw==","user":{"login":"yuzhuqingyun","id":7298470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTg0NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7298470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun","html_url":"https://github.com/yuzhuqingyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzhuqingyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-29T03:53:22Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T03:53:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"When
