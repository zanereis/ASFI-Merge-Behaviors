How about you create a separate class GPUStatistics similar to CacheStatistics for now and use it just for local debugging.

The two hash table inserts are by far cheaper than getting the time with System.nanoTime(). Of course if depends on the hardware platform, but it can be even micro seconds.

In which case, I should ask the developers of SystemML what format they would like to see for these additional timers.

Since there are no \"free lunches\", introducing an additional command-line flag (especially if intended only for development for only one component) becomes one more thing an end user has to be educated about ... also, adding a command-line flag has to be accompanied with supporting that feature via other APIs (such as MLContext) as well.

When you say that an end-user needs to be educated about it, what we do is print it out with the help message in usage. If i've haven't misunderstood you, that is all the education we'd need to do. \r\nOther counter-examples of something only the engine developer would care about is the different kinds of `-explain` (`hops`, `runtime`, `recompile_hops` & `recompile_runtime`). In my opinion, if a end-user is smart enough to understand these various kinds of \"explain\" dumps, an extra set of numbers printed by `-devstats` or its ilk should be a no-brainer. :)\r\n\r\nIn any case, I also understand that the `-explain` and `-debug` might be legacy options that have never been revisited under the set of high level questions that you pose and might just be technical debt that we need to clear up.\r\nAll I wanted to point out was that there is precedent, and adding a `-devstats` option is nothing extremely out of the ordinary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/284086705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/284088988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/412#issuecomment-284088988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/412","id":284088988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDA4ODk4OA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-03T22:33:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T22:33:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nakul02 I think you misunderstood what `-debug` flag refers to.
