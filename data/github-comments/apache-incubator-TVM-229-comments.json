The advantage of keeping the sparse weights representation all the way through is something that helps with keeping the weights size low in the final binary generated which could help with static size / footprint in the final binary at the expense of some runtime (obviously). For usecases where we go through this with BYOC or others where there are weight compression techniques, this should clear up reasonably ok, however where we fall back to traditional tvm compilation on CPUs and GPUs there's no weight compression techniques and thus this contributes to rodata bloat or flash bloat.\r\n> \r\n>     2. Even if it doesn't make sense to keep this in the final representation to be expanded at the runtime either in the form of an op for the Relay VM or a new op in the graph runtime - is this operator something that appears in other frameworks and if so does it make sense to keep this behaviour common across the stack to allow us to reuse this logic for other frontends as well i.e. the various frontends lower to a relay.op.densify () and the result of that is something that represents a dense weight tensor. Further legalization could end up creating this dense weight tensor ? One of the principles in compiler design is to try and bind things as late as possible to give us a chance of optimizing and being able to recover easily without too much reverse engineering. So this comes back to that as well.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> TBH I would probably prefer #2 as an approach to try and reduce any duplications in the frontends and give other compilers or others who use Relay a chance to get to the densify op. I don't think we can use it for any of our work instantly. If the performance or code size becomes an issue we'll need to reconsider a runtime or partial runtime representation of sparse weights at which point #1 would be a stepping stone towards it .\r\n> \r\n> These are my thought on the design.\r\n> \r\n> regards\r\n> Ramana\r\n\r\nThanks @u99127 for your inputs! Most of your arguments i concur. \r\nI think we have 2 possible approaches to bring Sparse Convnet models onto TVM:\r\n1:> Keep the sparse weight and convert to dense in runtime, as Sparse inference is not complete in TVM currently.\r\n2:> Optimize out the Sparse weights, by transforming to Dense while on-boarding to TVM.\r\n\r\nWhen i went through first approach, i found the performance is too bad and Sparse_to_Dense Op resulted in stack corruption when fed with higher dimension inputs, hence i switched to second approach, which makes sense if we think from TFLite perspective. Because TFLite framework, optmizes  out Densify Op when it comes to Sparse Inference. As my future work will include the Sparse Inference as well, i think at this point it will suffice to keep densified weight in Runtime.\r\n\r\nHowever as i mentioned earlier, if we want to keep in TVM runtime, current PR changes supports that as well, with the steps i mentioned in my previous comment. Provided we first fix the Sparse_to_Dense limitations(which i am looking into right now).\r\n   I think keeping a Densify Op is not a good option as it will be duplicate of Sparse_to_Dense Op.\r\n\r\nMay be we can do this Op conversion with a configurable user option in Frontend.\r\nNow by default we optimize out this Op and keep the dense weight in Runtime.\r\nWhen i am ready with an appropriate solution for Sparse_to_Dense Op, we can make that as default and keep the first approach to user choice, so that user can chose between performance or compression.\r\nLet me know your thoughts on this.

the current mainline does not generate  libverilator. The caching step will fail because we cannot found libverilator.\r\n\r\nSorry that i did not point in previous code review, and happy to discuss this further. Right now this PR has the following dependency:\r\n\r\n- libtvm depends on libverilator.so  When build with verilator runtime in set.\r\n\r\nIt would really be nice if the hw part can be built independently, and loaded on demand. So libtvm can load select and load the right version of libverilator when necessary. We can build the libverilator right at the test stage, with libtvm available.\r\n\r\nWe can explore a few ways to do that. One way I can think about, is as follows:\r\n\r\n- move the runtime part `src/runtime/contrib/verilator/` to the vta-hw, still include the json runtime, build and link against libtvm\r\n- Use a load_dll function(like in https://github.com/apache/tvm-vta/blob/main/apps/tsim_example/python/tsim.py#L27, we can define in vta) to load the dll in store in global namespace, which will register the necessarily callbacks for the verilog json runtime\r\n- Execute as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy to chat

First of all, I think it is very useful to be able to support additional meta data like names when the user can provid eit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, attaching a String that defaults to a concrete value would mean additional overhead for PackedFunc creation, and may be prohibitive if we want to create PackedFunc on the fly(with a goal to gain std::function level speed).\r\n\r\nIt would be good put more thoughts into this and think about how to improve  the impl in general. As a first step, it certainly does not hurt to make the name Optional and default to nullptr, which reduces the string construction cost. \r\n\r\nWe can alternatively think about the future path of bringing in PackedFunc as a sub-class of Object, and potentially sub-class PackedFunc. So the default one remains un-named, while there is a named subclass.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be great to discuss the API itself, for example, set_name is a mutable API, while in most cases we would prefer things to be immutable.\r\n\r\nGiven it is quite a core change, an RFC would be great.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/744864004/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/744947668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6890#issuecomment-744947668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6890","id":744947668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NDk0NzY2OA==","user":{"login":"lixiaoquan","id":25603835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjAzODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25603835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaoquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaoquan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T01:15:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T01:15:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kevinthesun

I think the top-level-reduction-only restriction still exists in TVM today.\r\n\r\nI noticed that `relay.transform.transform.FuseOps` fuses a `conv2d` and a following `relu` into one single function. If I understand correctly, this means, in the underlying TOPI implementation, there will be a `relu` operation outside the reduction from `conv2d` (scheduled via `inline`, `compute_at` or something like that). Such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (...) {\r\n  for (...) {\r\n    x += ... // conv2d\r\n  }\r\n  x = relu(x) // relu\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the reduction loop is no longer at top level any more.\r\n\r\nIs the aforementioned fusion really meaningful? Or is the fusion only used for third-party backends such as cuDNN?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/745041181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/745054063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7111#issuecomment-745054063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7111","id":745054063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTA1NDA2Mw==","user":{"login":"insop","id":1240382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDAzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1240382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop","html_url":"https://github.com/insop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2020-12-15T05:03:01Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T05:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1. @tsupei  Good fix, you might want to `git am` [this patch file](https://github.com/insop/incubator-tvm/commit/79e8cf5b24e5170fbfc51461249425ad6b868a7c.patch) to fix other locations\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nFrom 79e8cf5b24e5170fbfc51461249425ad6b868a7c Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001\r\nFrom: Insop Song <insop.song@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Mon, 14 Dec 2020 21:01:03 -0800\r\nSubject: [PATCH] Additional fix to batch_matmul\r\n\r\n- add to this PR, https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7111\r\n---\r\n python/tvm/topi/testing/batch_matmul.py | 2 +-\r\n python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py     | 2 +-\r\n 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)\r\n\r\ndiff --git a/python/tvm/topi/testing/batch_matmul.py b/python/tvm/topi/testing/batch_matmul.py\r\nindex a48c92967..d24198e96 100644\r\n--- a/python/tvm/topi/testing/batch_matmul.py\r\n+++ b/python/tvm/topi/testing/batch_matmul.py\r\n@@ -37,7 +37,7 @@ def batch_matmul(x, y):\r\n     \"\"\"\r\n     XB, M, _ = x.shape\r\n     YB, N, _ = y.shape\r\n-    batch = max(XB, YB)\r\n+    batch = te.max(XB, YB)\r\n     out = np.zeros((batch, M, N)).astype(x.dtype)\r\n     for i in range(batch):\r\n         out[i] = np.dot(x[i if XB != 1 else 0], y[i if YB != 1 else 0].T)\r\ndiff --git a/python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py b/python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py\r\nindex 166c79a4c..79b38de8c 100644\r\n--- a/python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py\r\n+++ b/python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py\r\n@@ -50,7 +50,7 @@ def batch_matmul(cfg, x, y, out_shape=None):\r\n     YB, N, YK = get_const_tuple(y.shape)\r\n     assert (XB == YB) or (YB == 1) or (XB == 1), \"batch dimension doesn't match\"\r\n     assert XK == YK, \"shapes of x and y is inconsistant\"\r\n-    B = max(XB, YB)\r\n+    B = te.max(XB, YB)\r\n     K = XK\r\n     if out_shape is not None:\r\n         assert out_shape[0] == B, \"got invalid output shape\"\r\n-- \r\n2.28.0\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. @zhiics\r\nLike most of other test files, this test[ test_topi_batch_matmul.py](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/python/topi/python/test_topi_batch_matmul.py) was not covering `te.var` case, hence we have this issue.\r\nShould we add those test cases in as well?
