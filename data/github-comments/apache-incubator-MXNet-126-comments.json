For a typical neural network implementation, single precision floating point is most commonly used, because double precision is unnecessary and leads to much more computational cost, and half precision computation is not native supported among many devices. Using fixed point data types are completely another case for performance optimization. What people really want is a single **efficient, flexible, minimal** and yet **portable** neural network implementation, that can be ported to multiple CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs.
