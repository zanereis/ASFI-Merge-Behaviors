@zhanghaohit I took a second look at the changes in this PR, and I believe it would be best to break the PR down into separate, smaller PRs:\r\n> \r\n> (1) modifications to VTA for OpenCL support (runtime, operator support etc.)\r\n> (2) quantization support for conv2d_transpose which is device agnostic\r\n> (3) modifications to device_annotation.cc\r\n> (4) once (3) is merged and approved, updating GraphPack pass to use device annotation\r\n> \r\n> Let me know what you think. This will make the PRs easier to review and merge.\r\n\r\nThanks @tmoreau89 for the suggestion. I've split into 3 small PRs here:\r\n#6124 \r\n#6125 \r\n#6126 \r\n\r\nAnd remove the unnecessary code that are not very related to OpenCL

@FrozenGene , \r\nFinal changes to this PR. \r\n\r\n* Introducing the `compute_at` knobs forces us to use `xgb_knob` tuner which does not support `locate_cache` annotations (so I switched to a custom

Legalizing depthwise gives a boost of 2x (for quantized). \r\n\r\nIf this won't  be approved by tonight, I will turn into a draft to pick up after I come back from holidays (i.e., 15 days).

Since CLI itself serves as an infra, it would be better to break this PR to a series of PRs like the following:\r\n\r\n- PR1: The basic CLI infra mainly including 1) CLI setup, 2) the registration mechanism, and 3) the document.\r\n- PR2: CLI -- compile.\r\n- PR3: CLI -- run.\r\n- PR4: CLI -- tune.\r\n\r\nIn this way, people can focus on the overall CLI infra in the first PR. Once everyone is happy with it, the rest PRs would have a much clearer scope. For example, \"CLI -- compile\" would attract people who are familiar with compilation flow. In this way, we can expect the following advantages:\r\n\r\n1. We can focus on what functions/options should be included in a scope.\r\n2. We can focus on the implementation of those functions/options in each scope.

Invariant identification: What is the best way to identify the if condition variables are not updated inside the block ?\r\n     For example in below case, how we can find out `var n` is invariant in the loop block:\r\n```\r\n    var n = 3\r\n    for (i: int32, 0, n: int32) {\r\n      if @tir.likely((n > 23), dtype=bool) {\r\n        n = n + 2      \r\n        data[i] = i\r\n      } else {\r\n        n = n + 3\r\n        data[i] = i + 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Scope identification: Need to scan each and every statement to do this, where logic  becomes significantly more complex.\r\n\r\nMay be we can discuss more about first Challenge.

all. This is an student intern of us, who is now helping us with the Ansor upstreaming. 😄 \r\n\r\nThe follow_split & follow_fused_split are two steps extent to `te.Stage.Split`. Each of these will collect information from the former history and process the split.\r\n\r\n## FollowSplit\r\n\r\nThis is mainly used in stage fusion using compute at.\r\nFor example we have stages: `Dense -> Relu`:\r\nWe've already done some tiling on Relu, and we would like to compute the Dense at the Relu stage. FollowSplit step is used to keep the outer most few iterators of Dense the same as the Relu stage.\r\nSince in Ansor, the split factor of Relu stage may be left as a None placeholder to be filled by search policy, by this way we can easily write a schedule with some kind of dynamic dependence.\r\n\r\n## FollowFusedSplit\r\n\r\nThis is mainly used in GPU cooperative fetching.\r\nFor example we have stages: `Input -> Dense`:\r\n```\r\n            for i.0@j.0 = ... : Bind to blockIdx.x\r\n                for i.1@j.1 = ... : Bind to threadIdx.x\r\n                    for i.2@j.2 = ...\r\n                        Input_shared = Input ...\r\n                        for k = ...\r\n                            Dense = ...\r\n```\r\nIn Ansor's search policy, the outer stage has been tiled. The the threadIdx.x axis is binded to a iterator generated by split & fuse step.\r\nWe use FollowFusedSplit step to compute out the final extent of the threadIdx.x binded iterator, to make sure that Input_shared stage can split out a iterator with same extent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/664167975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/664170160","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6142#issuecomment-664170160","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6142","id":664170160,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDE3MDE2MA==","user":{"login":"yangjunpro","id":407784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzc4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/407784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunpro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunpro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T07:26:51Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:26:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @jiuqi-yang for the nice work, @merrymercy @tqchen @FrozenGene @comaniac , would you please take a look at this PR?
