The new Curator 4.2.0 pulls ZK 3.5.4-beta, and we don't want to use a beta version in production. (the last stable official ZK release is 3.5.6)\r\nThe other problem is, that ZK comes not only from curator, but also from hadoop, so if we want to be sure that we only have a single ZooKeeper version on our classpath, then the best is to exclude it from both Curator and Hadoop and load our own version.\r\n\r\n\r\n> can it really be worked after version is changed\r\n\r\nit depends on the combination of versions. You are right, that it won't work if you only change ZooKeeper version. Curator 2.x is only compatible with ZooKeeper 3.4.x, while Curator 3.x is compatible only with ZooKeeper 3.5.x. The new Curator 4.x is [said to be compatible](https://curator.apache.org/zk-compatibility.html) with both ZooKeeper versions, but we found during testing, that it is not necessarily works with the old ZooKeeper. (also one thing is compile time compatibility and an other the run-time one) So we found, that the best is to use the latest Curator only with the new ZooKeeper. (it is good to know, that on the Hadoop trunk we already have Curator 4.2.0 and ZooKeeper 3.5.6, but I am not aware of any released Hadoop version yet that contains this change)\r\n\r\nSo the trick is to make sure to use proper (compatible) Curator-Hadoop-ZooKeeper versions. \r\n- E.g. the current combination used by Livy: Curator 2.7.1, ZooKeeper 3.4.6, Hadoop 2.7.3 \r\n- We are testing with the following versions: Curator 4.2.0, ZooKeeper 3.5.6, Hadoop 3.0.2\r\n\r\nWhen you try to build Livy with the new Curator/ZooKeeper, then you will face an other small issue (one mock object needs to be changed in the integration tests), but other than that, Livy is working for us. Assuming you exclude the old ZooKeeper that comes from Hadoop.\r\n\r\nI am mainly a ZooKeeper contributor, so I don't want to change the default Curator / ZooKeeper version in Livy, I think that is something the Livy community should decide / schedule. But I think it is an important feature to have the ability to explicitly set the ZooKeeper and Curator versions in Livy. So at least the community can test / experiment with the new third party versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/558044949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/comments/558720635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-livy/pull/238#issuecomment-558720635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-livy/issues/238","id":558720635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODcyMDYzNQ==","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-26T16:52:33Z","updated_at":"2019-11-26T16:52:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@huianyi I don't see the previous comments being resolved.
