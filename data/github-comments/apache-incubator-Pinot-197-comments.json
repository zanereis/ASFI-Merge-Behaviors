When a new node join the tenants, which might be triggered manually or the horizontal scaling based on the signal of running out of disk space, the data rebalancing should also be auto triggered when the pinot-controller observe the new node is alive for a while (e.g. 30 mins). With this feature, the disk shortage issue can be mitigated regardless of the underlying infra (ec2, k8s) taht holds pinots. Otherwise, each company's DevOps team need to implement a post processing workflow to trigger the tenant rebalancing after spinning up a new node.\r\n\r\nIn addition, pool based segment assignment strategy requires to trigger an api in order to assign **new** segments onto new nodes, which is even worse than the balanced assignment strategy.\r\n\r\nThe broker auto rebalancing needs to be considered too. https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10181 \r\n\r\nWanted to collect all related issues to raise awareness on making pinot Cloud Native, i.e. smoothly support capacity

When a new node join the tenants, which might be triggered manually or the horizontal scaling based on the signal of running out of disk space, the data rebalancing should also be auto triggered when the pinot-controller observe the new node is alive for a while (e.g. 30 mins). With this feature, the disk shortage issue can be mitigated regardless of the underlying infra (ec2, k8s) taht holds pinots. Otherwise, each company's DevOps team need to implement a post processing workflow to trigger the tenant rebalancing after spinning up a new node.\r\n\r\nWe can add a controller periodic task to automatically rebalance all tables (rebalance is idempotent, so it is no-op if no instance is changed), but that need to be disabled by default. Automatically rebalance works for non performance critical use cases, but for performance sensitive use cases (e.g. user facing high throughput use case), rebalance will reduce the cluster capacity, so should be performed within certain maintenance window and triggered manually.\r\n\r\n> In addition, pool based segment assignment strategy requires to trigger an api in order to assign **new** segments onto new nodes, which is even worse than the balanced assignment strategy.\r\n\r\nThis is intentional, and maybe we should do the same even for balanced strategy. For use cases that requires all segments for a partition to be colocated, assigning new segments to new nodes will break it. To solve this, we should use the approach above by automatically rebalancing it.\r\n\r\n> The broker auto rebalancing needs to be considered too. #10181\r\n\r\nCan we close #10181 and open a new ticket for it? The title is very confusing because instance should not be removed from IS when disabled","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1682820878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1682829449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11361#issuecomment-1682829449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11361","id":1682829449,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5kTfCJ","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-17T19:17:32Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T19:17:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agree in regular case we should not catch throwable, but in the above stack trace, the throwable is caught within a `Thread`, and we intentionally catch it so that the thread doesn't die silently (it won't be able to propagate it back to the main thread even if we don't catch it).

That means that if project A depends on project B, lines covered by tests defined on project A do not count on `report-aggregate`. You can easily see that by reading `target/site/jacoco-aggregate/jacoco.csv` on any project after running `mvn test`.\r\n\r\nInstead, `report` takes into account the coverage of the tests on the project itself but not the tests on the dependencies. Why do we get smaller coverage with this? I'm not sure. But with this change we are actually having coverage in projects we didn't have before. For example, see the difference between `pinot-query-runtime` in [this commit](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/commit/85844dafb7e5e57f2fe71b7a7f019cdc6a9dc9eb/tree/pinot-query-runtime) vs what is in [master](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/pinot/tree/master/pinot-query-runtime).\r\n\r\n`report-aggregate` should be used in a single maven project that depends (directly or indirectly) on all other. But we want to split the test execution in two in order to have some parallelism (by doing so, we reduce the test time from 1h30 to 1h, aprox). This is why I also opened https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11375 in order to test what happens when we run all tests in the same aggregator (as seen there, the coverage increases but the time spent on tests increases as well).\r\n\r\nWe can still have a single aggregation project that depends on different modules depending on the active profile, but we would need to list all projects instead of using negation expressions as we use in the current scripts.\r\n\r\nIdeally, what we should do is to run tests in parallel in the same reactor. There are two problems there:\r\n1. It seems easier to do in junit than in testng. \r\n2. Some tests may not be prepared to run concurrently (for example, integration tests that reserve ports).\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to create a GH issue to discuss about that in a broader way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1683553753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1683578831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11380#issuecomment-1683578831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11380","id":1683578831,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5kWV_P","user":{"login":"KKcorps","id":5559703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTk3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5559703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps","html_url":"https://github.com/KKcorps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KKcorps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T08:47:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T08:47:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This looks good!

Do you think we could split tests into 4 sets and get further improvement on test time?\r\n\r\nI don't like the idea of splitting test even more for two reasons:\r\n1. It is a bit expensive (in terms of developer time) to balance how to split the tests between executors\r\n2. Each executor consumes resources on GH.\r\n\r\nI don't now who pay for the GH executors or how many we have. But I'm assuming there are a few executors available. Consuming more executors per PR (theoretically) implies to have a bottleneck between PRs.\r\n\r\nI also don't know how large are the GH executors we are using, but given that we run maven with a parallelism of 16 I would guess they are quite large. I think it would be better to invest that developer time into the last proposed solution: to run test concurrently in a single maven reactor (and therefore in a single GH executor).\r\n\r\n@xiangfu0 is the one that has been working the most in balancing the test sets and I'm sure he knows more about the infrastructure we use. With that context, he may be more able to answer your question.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1683970732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1683971590","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11382#issuecomment-1683971590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11382","id":1683971590,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5kX14G","user":{"login":"gortiz","id":1913993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTM5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1913993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz","html_url":"https://github.com/gortiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gortiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T14:04:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T14:04:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Great explanation.

Currently we can still run into this problem, but it will be easier to catch because we don't allow adding segment to the already shut down table data manager. To solve this problem, we should check if server has successfully dropped the table. Let me see if it can be easily added. If not, we can address it separately.\r\n\r\nAs for the `stop` or `preShutDown`, I decided to not add them because the contract around them is unclear to me. Should we block other operations after `stop` is called? Or only `stop` the upsert metadata manager but allow all other operations? If we block other operations, then there is no difference between `stop` and `shutDown`; if we do not block other operations, I don't know the side effect of adding another segment after `stop`, and it can run into very weird state if somehow `stop` is called but `shutDown` is not (some exception happened in between)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1684240370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1684319560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11382#issuecomment-1684319560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11382","id":1684319560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5kZK1I","user":{"login":"zhtaoxiang","id":9796617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTY2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9796617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang","html_url":"https://github.com/zhtaoxiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhtaoxiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T18:57:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T18:57:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> ## Use `report` instead of `report-aggregate`\r\n> I've tried that in #11376.
