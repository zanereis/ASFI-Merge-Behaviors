I totally understand your concern about this breaking with the pattern of other service descriptors. It will be even worse after adding the web UI proxying rules, as our web UI also requires some paths at the root level. At this time, it is infeasible to rewrite Cloudera Manager to accept a gateway/topology in the request URLs (and thoroughly test it afterwards).\r\n\r\nIf it would be better to keep the service definition out of upstream until a point that CM is able to handle the additional path components, then I'm fine with that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/486872136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/486915662","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/76#issuecomment-486915662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/76","id":486915662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjkxNTY2Mg==","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T03:48:21Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T03:48:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/486915662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/comments/488142749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/88#issuecomment-488142749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/88","id":488142749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4ODE0Mjc0OQ==","user":{"login":"jtran-cloudera","id":25396464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk2NDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25396464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera","html_url":"https://github.com/jtran-cloudera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran-cloudera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-30T22:47:29Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T22:47:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I chatted with Larry, and his suggestion is to remove the requirement on a default topology for the CM API.

Another option might be to redirect/rewrite to the proper endpoint with the host and port information\r\n\r\nThat's fine. My original hope was that, if the user doesn't give us host/port, we can default to the host/port in the topology, but (like you pointed out) that breaks outgoing links.\r\n\r\nWould like to document that too, but I'm not sure where to but it to say \"You gotta provide `?host=..&port=...`\".
