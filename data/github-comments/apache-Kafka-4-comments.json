It looks like the callback is discarded without completion on a rebalance. I think we should probably make sure it always gets invoked eventually. A couple other points: \n- Do you think it would be helpful to include the TopicPartition and the offset that was seeked to in the callback?\n- Should we provide a similar mechanism for seekToBeginning and seekToEnd?

Since a rebalance will change the offset and invalidate the previous seek, I think we can invalidate the callback as well.\n\n2) Yes, on a double think I think it will be useful to include the TopicPartition and the offset that was seeked to in the callback. This will be useful upon OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE exception.\n\n3) Due to the use case of this callback, I personally don't think it is useful to include it in seekToBeginning and seekToEnd.

My preference is the same as yours, to squash any commits that don't add any value. However, this is not a requirement of the Kafka project at this stage, so it's up to the submitter.\n\nThere are two options if you want to squash:\n- Force push to the same branch. Comments on commits may disappear (sometimes they stay with a note about being for an out of date commit), but comments on the PR itself will remain.

When the consumer invokes seek(), the position is updated immediately and position() will return the seeked position. It's only later that the user finds out if that position is out of range. Intuitively, I would expect the callback to be invoked when the position is updated. I wonder if instead of using the generic ConsumerSeekCallback, the behavior would be clearer with an OffsetOutOfRangeCallback, which is only invoked when that error occurs? Then we wouldn't have to worry about ensuring the callback is invoked in all cases and it would make sense for the position to be updated immediately.

But would this OffsetOutOfRangeCallback be similar to the ConsumerRebalanceCallback where you need to provided it when you subscribe? It seems like it has the same somewhat weird callback semantics where it is provided once and can be invoked many times.\n\nBut now that I'm thinking about more of these types of events, is it possible we just have the name wrong? Maybe we should be implementing a `ConsumerListener` instead of a variety of callbacks? I think that naming is more in line with how we would normally describe the functionality since each of these methods can be invoked multiple times (rather than being a callback associated with a single invocation of a method).\n\nIn any case, for this specifically, it is a bit odd that the callback would be disconnected from the request, but on the other hand, shouldn't this type of event only ever occur during a seek? The only other time it happens is during initial subscription, right?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/129710076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/129713482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/110#issuecomment-129713482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/110","id":129713482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyOTcxMzQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-11T05:49:19Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T05:49:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr

Usually when we get the offset out of range error, we just reset the position, so i wouldn't see that callback as one which could be invoked multiple times. The callback just provides a way to override the default reset behavior. It's also intuitive in my opinion to be able to handle the error at the same location in the code that the seek is performed.\n\nI agree, however, that this is still not great. The user might want to intercept all out of range errors, not just the ones that result from a specific seek. The `ConsumerListener` interface could be interesting (at the very least, I definitely would approve of changing `ConsumerRebalanceCallback` to `ConsumerRebalanceListener`). It might be worthwhile to spend a little time trying to flesh out a basic sketch of the interface for comparison.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/129967950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130005348","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/132#issuecomment-130005348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/132","id":130005348,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDAwNTM0OA==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-11T18:30:57Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T18:30:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #127](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/127/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130005348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130015246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/118#issuecomment-130015246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/118","id":130015246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDAxNTI0Ng==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-11T18:50:31Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T18:50:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ewencp @hachikuji I think we are discussing to things: 1) whether it is more intuitive to call it ConsumerSeekCallback or OffsetOutOfRangeCallback; 2) whether we should turn it and other callback into listener instead. I agree with your opinion on 2). But 2) goes beyond the scope of this ticket and requires much detailed discussion since it changes the user interface (e.g. ConsumerRebalanceListener). Can we focus on 1) first?\n\nI would prefer ConsumerSeekCallback to OffsetOutOfRangeCallback. If the user expects ConsumerSeekCallback to be invoked when position is updated, shouldn't he has the same expectation for OffsetOutOfRangeCallback? By keeping ConsumerSeekCallback, we have a more general callback API, and we can ensure that it is always invoked, including when rebalance happens or when user re-subscribe to partitions. We can describe in the document that seek() is actually an asynchronous API and it is only effective when the fetch after the seek gets a non-error response.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130015246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130049260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/128#issuecomment-130049260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/128","id":130049260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDA0OTI2MA==","user":{"login":"benstopford","id":1297498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc0OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford","html_url":"https://github.com/benstopford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benstopford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-11T20:10:41Z","updated_at":"2015-08-11T20:10:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good comments from Grant.

I have updated it according to your comments. The two main things I have done are to wrap all calls to sendRequestToBrokers with a try/catch block (previously I was only doing it in the one that caused the bug described in the jira) and to fix the strings as you pointed out. Let me know if this ok. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130366463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130372596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/102#issuecomment-130372596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/102","id":130372596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDM3MjU5Ng==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-12T17:07:04Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T17:07:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"[kafka-trunk-git-pr #131](https://builds.apache.org/job/kafka-trunk-git-pr/131/) SUCCESS\nThis pull request looks good\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130372596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130449836","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/133#issuecomment-130449836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/133","id":130449836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDQ0OTgzNg==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-12T21:09:33Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T21:09:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap Trivial patch since I just stole this code from Hadoop. Do we want to also want to run through all the existing code and mark, e.g., the new producer classes as stable as part of this patch?\n\nI'm also not sure if we really need all 3 of stable, evolving, and unstable. I don't think we've ever treated anything as being in the evolving state. Or perhaps we should have one release cycle for major new features like the new consumer where we mark them as evolving so we have an out if we end up needing to make a compatibility breaking change?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130449836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/130451081","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/133#issuecomment-130451081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/133","id":130451081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMDQ1MTA4MQ==","user":{"login":"gwenshap","id":1189030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1189030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap","html_url":"https://github.com/gwenshap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gwenshap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-12T21:15:49Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T21:15:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently we have exactly two modes:\n- Don't break compatibility ever (most of the code base)\n- May change unexpectedly at any time (New consumer)\n\nI like the idea of first releasing new major components as \"evolving\" for the first release, since (as we found out with the new producer) when more people use the API, deficiencies get discovered and stabilizing the APIs too soon may lock us into bad APIs.\n\nRegarding existing code...
