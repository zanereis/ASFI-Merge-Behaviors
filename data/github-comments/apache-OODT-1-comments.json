Ask for review when it's totally done :) :+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/oodt/issues/comments/132282147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/oodt/issues/comments/132282461","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/oodt/pull/25#issuecomment-132282461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/oodt/issues/25","id":132282461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjI4MjQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"buggtb","id":103544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb","html_url":"https://github.com/buggtb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T17:10:24Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T17:10:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Okay I'll get that done later as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/oodt/issues/comments/132282461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/oodt/issues/comments/132331575","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/oodt/pull/23#issuecomment-132331575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/oodt/issues/23","id":132331575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjMzMTU3NQ==","user":{"login":"buggtb","id":103544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzU0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb","html_url":"https://github.com/buggtb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buggtb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T19:52:26Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T19:52:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OKay I've created a branch I'll push this PR to it later.
