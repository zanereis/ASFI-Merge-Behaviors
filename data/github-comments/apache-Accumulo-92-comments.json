So, it's not clear which specific occurrences should be addressed here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1208311006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1208312709","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2834#issuecomment-1208312709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2834","id":1208312709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IBWOF","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-08T16:00:40Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T16:00:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's being used in `AccumuloConfiguration.get(String)` and `AccumuloConfiguration.iterator`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1208312709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1208314063","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2855#issuecomment-1208314063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2855","id":1208314063,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IBWjP","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-08T16:01:58Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T16:01:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @ctubbsii commented on #2665 :\r\n\r\nIf you paste a link to the comment itself, rather than the ticket number, GitHub should provide an easy way to navigate back to the original comment, and will show a preview of that comment inline.

taking a deeper look, I'm not sure what this utility is specifically doing, so I can't speak to the benefits of where its entry point should be. However, one comment I'll make about SiteConfiguration is: the point of removing SiteConfiguration was to ensure that we don't have a dependency, or in general, make any assumptions about where the shell was being run, relative to where server processes are deployed. For example, there's no reason to assume that the server configuration file (the site configuration), with the `instance.secret` for writing to protected nodes in ZooKeeper, is available on the class path for the shell. The shell is a client application, and should not be assumed to have access to the server's configuration file at all.\r\n\r\nThe same is not true for utilities specifically written to assist system administrators perform maintenance on Accumulo itself on the server side. Many such utilities are required to be run on the server itself, so it is reasonable for them to assume they have access to the server configuration on their class path.\r\n\r\nLet's be careful not to lose site of the point of getting SiteConfiguration out of the shell, and forcing all these utilities to run client side, and then needing to bake in convoluted hacks to get them to run off the server. It is perfectly acceptable for server-side utilities to just assume access to server-side configuration and class path.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1208327394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1208330708","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2852#issuecomment-1208330708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2852","id":1208330708,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IBanU","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-08T16:16:55Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T16:16:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This

I did notice a test failure in NamespacesIT, after the second commit that was related to configuration property inheritance, and I think is related that needs to be investigated as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1209794485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1209809702","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2862#issuecomment-1209809702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2862","id":1209809702,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IHDsm","user":{"login":"milleruntime","id":11872539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODcyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11872539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime","html_url":"https://github.com/milleruntime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milleruntime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-09T19:52:25Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T19:52:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am also trying to test the shell command with multiple directories but haven't had any success.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1209809702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1209896073","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2834#issuecomment-1209896073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2834","id":1209896073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IHYyJ","user":{"login":"dlmarion","id":567911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzkxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion","html_url":"https://github.com/dlmarion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlmarion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-09T21:05:45Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T21:05:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ctubbsii  - See https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2864.

This makes it unreliable for using the StoredTabletFile class in data structures in the context of requiring separate entries for each metadata entry when it is found stored non-normalized.\r\n2. Overriding any of these methods can break existing code that relies on the current behavior. But, the current behavior might be broken, too (because of bullet point number 1 above).\r\n3. There are a few cases where we place TabletFile in the same data structure as the StoredTabletFile, requiring them to have cohesive implementations for these methods.\r\n4. ScanServerRefTabletFile complicates things further, because it overrides equals and hashCode, forcing incompatibility with the base class implementation, if these happen to get stored in the same data structure.\r\n\r\nI had considered removing the compareTo method, and defining an explicit comparator. That would address the places where we are trying to compare using the natural ordering of the base class and the subclass. But, it doesn't address these other issues.\r\n\r\nCreating an interface at the base might help make things less confusing... I'm not sure. Either way, it looks like we're going to have to dig through every use of these classes in any kind of data structure, to evaluate for correct reliance on the equals, hashCode, and compareTo implementations.\r\n\r\nClosing this PR, because it's not the right fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1212299115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1212300178","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2854#issuecomment-1212300178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2854","id":1212300178,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5IQjuS","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T17:53:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T17:53:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Is it possible to have a `TabletFile` equal to a `StoredTabletFile` with these changes?\r\n\r\nIt was possible before these changes.

I found a few more things that might need changing:\r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like the auto-refresh is working anymore\r\n\r\nIt looks like at least one of the drop down menus is cut off:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-11 16-50-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/184240285-432b2c90-1299-48b8-a136-06481de9b7fe.png)\r\n\r\nAlso when opening this option, it covers part of the nav bar (and the botton is not highlighted when clicked like the others):\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-08-11 16-50-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725857/184240282-3b96a513-640c-4420-97a0-538dfba42a33.png)\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a way to have these two display the drop down portion with the right side aligned (rather than the usual left side of the button aligned with the left side of the dropdown).\r\n\r\nOther than those things, everything else looks good as far as I have seen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1212485168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1213000641","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2814#issuecomment-1213000641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2814","id":1213000641,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5ITOvB","user":{"login":"cshannon","id":123009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon","html_url":"https://github.com/cshannon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cshannon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-12T11:15:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T11:15:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@milleruntime - How about we just go ahead and merge the utilities as they are and keep the main methods and then in a separate PR we remove the main or deprecate them from all the utilities?

I have a branch with a rough prototype/proof of concept that is a work in progress here: https://github.com/cshannon/accumulo/commits/accumulo-2820\r\n\r\nIt's not ready for a real review yet as there's more work to be done but you can take a look if you get a chance and see the direction I'm going. I had a couple questions/comments and wanted to get your thoughts.\r\n\r\n1. The metadata table scan could technically just be done by the client without an RPC call but I kept the current way of sending an RPC request and letting the server do it inside of the [TableDiskUsage](https://github.com/cshannon/accumulo/blob/9b6ae27be4ba50513cf41c58281324211f8e75d3/server/base/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/server/util/TableDiskUsage.java) class. I think this is much better as it keeps the current design intact and is a simpler update plus this utility already scans metadata for the file names to use for the HDFS iterator. So it can simply be updated to read the sizes from metadata instead and the client/shell code can more or less work the same without many modifications.\r\n2. I created new disk usage RPC call which same as the old with a new method parameter.  This will allow passing any options we want to custom the du command when sent to the server for processing. The main thing now is a [Mode](https://github.com/cshannon/accumulo/blob/9b6ae27be4ba50513cf41c58281324211f8e75d3/core/src/main/thrift-gen-java/org/apache/accumulo/core/clientImpl/thrift/TDiskUsageMode.java) enum which just currently has FILE, DIRECTORY, METADATA. The idea is the user running the command could specify how they want to compute the size. The documentation will describe the benefits/drawbacks of each mode. FILE is just the current default way of scanning the HDFS files, DIRECTORY would be for using the hdfs -dus command (not implemented yet in my prototype) and METADATA would be just scanning the metadata table. Having the options parameter and enum for mode will allow us to easily expand in the future with any flags or settings we want to compute usage.\r\n3. I still need to update things to handle scanning the root table if someone wants to know the metadata table size itself.\r\n4. I haven't looked at bulk import stuff yet but that could be another mode or just be included automatically, not sure.\r\n5.
