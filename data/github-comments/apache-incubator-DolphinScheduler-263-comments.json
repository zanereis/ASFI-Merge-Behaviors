WorkGroup and environment should be displayed after data back. For this, we can't set workGroup and environment manually, that is why I use isCreate.\r\nSecondly, just want to create a task, then we need to set the default value for workGroup and environment after getting the environmentList.\r\nThirdly, change the work group and set the default value for environment. For this, I agree with you, it can be handled by using watch, but it should be effect after the component mounted.\r\n@rockfang
