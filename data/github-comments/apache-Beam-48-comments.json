ReduceFnTester is in the Testing package. Hrm. That's disappointing.\n\nSo, I'm going to propose a history that lasts for the duration of the PR:\n\nSplit `ReduceFnTester.TestTimerInternals` into the `ReduceFnTester` and the `TestTimerInternals`, move `TestTimerInternals` to `InMemoryTimerInternals`\n\nUse `InMemoryTimerInternals` everywhere, delete unused code\n\nAfter the PR, these can be squashed together; but should make reviewing the two steps simpler.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/250345964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/250354393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1023#issuecomment-250354393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1023","id":250354393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDM1NDM5Mw==","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-29T02:25:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T02:25:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Good idea.

The only pending modification is about avoid fusion. To avoid this, I tested the following:\n\n```\n      PCollection<T> output = input.apply(Create.of(query))\n          .apply(ParDo.of(new ReadFn<>(dataSourceConfiguration, rowMapper)));\n\n      PCollection<KV<Integer, T>> intermediate1 = output\n          .apply(WithKeys.of(new SerializableFunction<T, Integer>() {\n            public Integer apply(T record) {\n              Random random = new Random();\n              return random.nextInt();\n            }\n          }));\n\n      PCollection<KV<Integer, Iterable<T>>> intermediate2 = intermediate1\n          .apply(GroupByKey.<Integer, T>create());\n\n\n      PCollection<Iterable<T>> intermediate3 = intermediate2\n          .apply(Values.<Iterable<T>>create());\n\n      output = intermediate3\n          .apply(Flatten.<T>iterables());\n\n      return output;\n```\n\nThe `WithKeys` transform creates `PCollection` of `KV<Integer, T>`. It requires to define a coder. So, I tried to define `.setCoder(KVCoder.<Integer, T>of(SerializableCoder.of(Integer.class), SerializableCoder.of(T))`. However, `SerializableCoder` doesn't directly accept a generic. So I would have to create a wrapper class on top of `T`.
