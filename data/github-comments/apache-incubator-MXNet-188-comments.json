very good documentation.\r\nThe codes for creating/killing threads are under src/engine folder\r\n\r\nFrom what I'm understanding is after executor optimized the graph, we will push ops to engine in topo order.\r\nThere are 3 engines: \r\n1.naive \r\n2.threaded pool \r\n3.threaded per device\r\n\r\nthreaded pool engine is create a common thread pool for all devices and all workers are consuming tasks from the blocking queue.\r\n\r\nthreaded per device engine is creating thread pool per device. \r\nI'm not sure the purpose of creating this engine, my guess is the execution time is not similar across different devices, so it's better to dispatch similar job in the same queue to increase throughput.\r\nHope someone better understand can
