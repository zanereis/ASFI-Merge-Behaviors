One concern is infinite forwarding loops -- can you get a case where a stale worker A forwards to worker B which it thinks is leader, worker B can also be stale, etc.? I guess in order for this to actually loop you'd probably need some ridiculous number of nodes with stale leadership info and having gone stale at different times?\n2. Has the KIP been updated? I only see a case for 409 if there is an existing restart in progress. Arguably this is a little weird anywhere except for when you need to forward (you can always just use simple locking and restart multiple times to satisfy the request).\n\nGenerally the patch looks good; the 202 status codes are now out of date, but we knew some stuff  would need updating after KIP refinements.

I've kicked off tests here: https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/409 and they look like they should finish up cleanly. The failed tests were for MM and were due to the fact that the MM test creates the verifiable producer immediately in the `__init__` method, before the security config is set on Kafka. This just makes the lookup dynamic so we don't have to wait to instantiate the service.\n\nWe may want to follow this approach more generally too -- this gets rid of the annoying pattern of having to instantiate all services in the test itself as long as the services like ZK and Kafka properly handle setting the security protocol after instantiation. I think we want this anyway because any test where we'd want to shutdown, modify settings, and start up with new security configs would require this as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/207648190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/207648607","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1207#issuecomment-207648607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1207","id":207648607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzY0ODYwNw==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-08T23:40:23Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T23:40:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gwenshap, @guozhangwang, @junrao If any of you can look, this needs another committer to review as well.
