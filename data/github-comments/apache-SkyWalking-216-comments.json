Of course Kafka is fine, we have kafka consumer for our own for a while. It is not a problem.\r\nThe reasons I didn't ask for the beat's plugin besides above are\r\n1. I am not sure whether Elastic will accept the pull request or not, if YES, then no problem.\r\n2. New plugin means, users have to upgrade their filebeat or add a new plugin. Either, there is extra works. If those don't provide benefits, we are wasting time on both sides.\r\n\r\nStill, you both know more details than I did.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/774920782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/774925970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6261#issuecomment-774925970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6261","id":774925970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDkyNTk3MA==","user":{"login":"hailin0","id":14371345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzcxMzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14371345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0","html_url":"https://github.com/hailin0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hailin0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-08T07:10:25Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T07:10:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> 1.
