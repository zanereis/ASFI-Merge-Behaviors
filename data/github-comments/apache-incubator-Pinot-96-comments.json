So, maybe an option like `ignoreOffsetConsistency` ?\r\n\r\nOperator can provide an offset, but it is hard to do that on a per partition basis. They will need to enter a command for each partition, maybe. I would say provide a way to create consuming segments for _all_ partitions with one command. Optionally, the operator can specify partition numbers, and we can re-create consuming segments for those partitions. Depending on the boolean to ignore the consistency, we can either return an error or force create a consuming segment. If we are force creating, just bump up the sequence number far enough out (say, +100) so that we know by looking at things that something changed (when they call for support -- this is experimental, and there is no saying what else went wrong).\r\n\r\nLet us be really careful here, and offer minimum features on this. Such scenarios have not been tested, so this is not a beginner task to go and validate possible race conditions via manual testing.  Good thing is we know that the automatic recovery ignores this condition. I would like it to stay that way. \r\n\r\nIn order to add a consuming segment, you need to do the following: (1) Add segment metadata (2) Update the idealstate.\r\n\r\nNot sure what happens when automatic correction comes around between (1) and (2). We will need to play that out manually and see.\r\n\r\nA safe method of doing this is perhaps to send out a helix broadcast to all controllers when the API is received, and let the controller that is master for that table handle it, perhaps while locking out the realtime fixer job.\r\n\r\nit will also be useful to NOT allow deletion of consuming segments unless the admin explicitly says so in the segment deletion API. I suggest adding a `includeConsumingSegments` option there.\r\n\r\nAll this makes it clear, that the admins have the knobs to turn around for automatic fixes, but when they start doing things manually, they are on a thin line.

Delete all your consuming segments, and the entering the command to create them. Two APIs will get them back to normal.\r\n\r\nWhile recreating the consuming segments, they have a choice:\r\n- Auto-pick the offset as per prev segment\r\n- Pick earliest offset, even if lower than prev segment\r\n- Pick latest offset even if lower than prev segment\r\n\r\nI suggest we do not include a way for the operator to specify the offset (as yet.

I don't  understand the proposal clearly. Table config already has ways to specify earliest/latest/1d/3d etc. \r\n\r\nLet us see what are the cases we need to handle:\r\n- User has deleted the consuming segment (or segments) by mistake and wants to restore whatever was there\r\n- User has deleted the consuming segments (or segments) because some partition-groups had a bad offset. User has the right offset to re-start consumption from.\r\n- User has deleted all consuming segments because they changed something in the underlying stream (e.g. changed the kafka topic, or something like that)\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases, we need the following arguments\r\n- A partition group ID (or, some way to say \"all partition groups\")\r\n- A directive to pick the best offset (i.e. pick the next offset from prev segment if that offset is still in the stream. Otherwise, pick the earliest offset  in the stream, while indicating loss of data)\r\n- A directive to say that the offsets in the previous segments need to be forgotten, and we just need to pick whatever offset is available now in the partition-group(s), even if it compares lower than the previous segment's offset. In this case, the table config will indicate whether the offset to be chosen is \"earliest\" or \"latest\" or some other offset directive. This is same as table creation mode.\r\n\r\nAre you in agreement with this, or am I missing some things? Once we have identified the requirements, we can design an API that meets all of that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/877523700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/877541179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7134#issuecomment-877541179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7134","id":877541179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NzU0MTE3OQ==","user":{"login":"rpatid10","id":83940000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTQwMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83940000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10","html_url":"https://github.com/rpatid10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpatid10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-10T02:25:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-10T02:58:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Steps to enable Kerberos Authentication:\r\n1.

With this approach, the consumed records are kept, but we have to wait for the next consuming segment to ingest the actual data for the new columns (we might be able to build an api to force commit the current consuming segments and create new consuming segments)\r\n2. (Not supported yet) Drop the already consumed records and re-consume from the start offset with the new columns with actual data. This approach can load data for new columns immediately, but the already consumed records are dropped and re-consumed which can cause temporary data inconsistency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/878412701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/878651270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/7157#issuecomment-878651270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7157","id":878651270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODY1MTI3MA==","user":{"login":"mqliang","id":12423751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDIzNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12423751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang","html_url":"https://github.com/mqliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mqliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-12T22:59:07Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T22:59:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"test failed due to flaky issue. close and re-open to trigger a re-run","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/878651270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/878661085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/7043#issuecomment-878661085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/7043","id":878661085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3ODY2MTA4NQ==","user":{"login":"siddharthteotia","id":2150694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTA2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2150694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia","html_url":"https://github.com/siddharthteotia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siddharthteotia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-12T23:19:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T23:37:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"At LinkedIn, we are exploring a combined design for subqueries and distributed joins since design / architecture wise there might be overlap and it is good to think of both design wise. cc @amrishlal  @jackjlli \r\nOnce we have had some preliminary thought / initial design, we will share with community to iterate upon and collaborate further.
