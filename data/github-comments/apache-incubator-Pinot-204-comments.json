Should this PR not include places in pinot-spi where we can throw exception if a client tries to create a table config that does not have a schema with the same name? Right now, the `TableConfigBuilder` class accepts any schema as the schemaName. We should be throwing an exception there, so that these problems are caught earlier?\r\n\r\nMost of the users are using REST endpoint to POST a json table config to create table.\r\nIt's ok to catch earlier in TableConfigBuilder, just the validation cannot be ignored from the server side.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1727022206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1727029324","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11558#issuecomment-1727029324","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11558","id":1727029324,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5m8GBM","user":{"login":"itschrispeck","id":27231838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjMxODM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27231838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck","html_url":"https://github.com/itschrispeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itschrispeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-20T06:09:59Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T06:09:59Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@siddharthteotia

If so, that is not enough imo to see the trend line and may give an outdated picture ?\r\n\r\nThere is either something I'm missing or something you are :D.\r\n\r\nWhere do you say the metric is only updated once when channel is initialized? In pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/transport/QueryServer.java and pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/transport/ServerChannels.java I'm using the method that sets a Supplier, not the actual value. I'm mainly calling `AbstractMetrics.setOrUpdateGlobalGauge(final String metricName, final LongSupplier valueSupplier)`.\r\n\r\nWhen using this method that accepts a supplier, it is stored in the metric. Whenever the metric is read (from JMX) it calls the supplier. Therefore the value is calculated at pulling base, not pushing base. That is why we don't need to `set` periodically.\r\n\r\nThere are other places where we use this family of methods, like:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/bc07eb8e7fa1ea4ef26ebbcd1a2ce2087a3058e4/pinot-minion/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/minion/BaseMinionStarter.java#L255\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/bc07eb8e7fa1ea4ef26ebbcd1a2ce2087a3058e4/pinot-plugins/pinot-minion-tasks/pinot-minion-builtin-tasks/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/plugin/minion/tasks/mergerollup/MergeRollupTaskGenerator.java#L864\r\n\r\nBut maybe what do you mean is that in some place in this PR I'm not calling the version with the supplier and therefore the value never change. It wouldn't be strange given that was my initial mistake. But I've read the PR again looking for that mistake and it looks to me that I'm always using the supplier (using the notation `metric::method`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1729055236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1729070397","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11632#issuecomment-1729070397","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11632","id":1729070397,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5nD4U9","user":{"login":"cypherean","id":66686803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Njg2ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66686803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean","html_url":"https://github.com/cypherean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cypherean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-21T08:11:33Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T08:11:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey

(I had previously loosely been using \"alias\" to describe this association)\r\n- How would you envision hybrid tables fitting into this paradigm? Is a hybrid table then a logical table mapping to 2 physical tables by default? Because of timeBoundary handling, it's not quite that simple. But should users be able to associate only `myTable_REALTIME` with a given logical table, and not include `myTable_OFFLINE` ?  Or should hybrid tables be treated as a single non-separable entity, as though they are one table?

Instead, keep it the same. The logical table binding should happen _before_ we branch between realtime/offline.\r\n\r\nThis is basically the idea. Currently hybrid table is an implicit logical table, where it always consist of 2 physical tables - one offline and one real-time. We can keep it implicit and connecting them by the raw table name. I'm thinking we may also introduce an explicit hybrid logical table concept in addition to the implicit one where we allow connecting multiple offline tables with multiple real-time tables, but we need to design a way to represent the time boundary.\r\n\r\n> So, the query comes into the broker, we lookup if there is a physical table defined, substitute the physical table name(s) and then do further query processing. Each of the underlying physical tables could be hybrid, or realtime-only or offline-only.\r\n\r\nHybrid table itself is already not a physical representation, so I'd prefer modeling it as a logical table, even though it is implicit. Then the abstraction would be logical table can point to multiple tables, either physical or logical. This way, we can share the same abstraction for the hybrid table management (currently it is hard-coded into 2 parts, one for real-time and one for offline).\r\n\r\n> In terms of allowed mapping, we should have something that enables mapping one logical table to one or more physical tables.

It is OK if the brokers do not set a watch (perhaps preferred that way). The mapping can be updated via a controller API, and the brokers informed by the controller.\r\n\r\nYes, mapping needs to be stored in ZK under property store. We can discuss the path in the detailed design. Broker doesn't need a watch, when the mapping is updated, controller can send a message to broker to refresh the routing (same as current table config update).\r\n\r\n> * The logical table should not be a Helix resource (intuitively).

Logical table is just a mapping from a logical table name to n table resources, and it can contain any table type.\r\n\r\n> * How will table metrics be emitted?  Ideally, all table level metrics should be emitted under the logical table name. Code may become a bit messy at place (emit physical table, logical table, and global metrics)\r\n\r\nGood point. We need to design this properly. Physical computation metrics can be associated with the physical table, query stats can be associated with the logical table.\r\n\r\n> * Operational tools need to be examined: If a logical table maps to a different physical table, then some of the table APIs should be modified to reflect that there is a different physical table. Not sure how this will work if there is more than one physical table.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine adding a new set of APIs for logical tables, where we only allow modifying the mapping. Physical table management might remain the same. E.g. we don't really have any API associated with the hybrid table.\r\n\r\n> * At least for a start, let us assume that all physical tables have the same schema.

Schema only associates with physical table.\r\n\r\n> Instead of thinking this through peace meal, I strongly suggest we start writing a design doc, with at least the requirements part clearly identified.\r\n\r\nYes. We just brainstorm and put some random thoughts here to be covered in the design.

I am inclined to say that we let the current REALTIME/OFFLINE be as it is, and call it a HYBRID \"physical\" table, and not let this leak into the logical table concept we are trying to build (unless there is a use case that cannot be solved otherwise). This may end up complicating the logical table design, just to shoehorn it into the current hybrid table mechanisms.\r\n\r\nPinot has a scale problem of number of segments in a single physical table due to ZK limit, which can also be solved with the logical table. Thinking about the current hybrid table, it is 2 physical tables with a time boundary. IMO modeling it as a physical table can be more confusing because it is not the basic management unit on server, but only a routing concept on broker, which is actually aligned with the proposed logical table concept.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1732740103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1732749747","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11658#issuecomment-1732749747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11658","id":1732749747,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5nR6mz","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-25T01:04:55Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T01:04:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It is already done this way, where `TableUpsertMetadataManager` is the pluggable interface, `TableUpsertMetadataManagerFactory` is the factory to plug in custom implementation, `BaseTableUpsertMetadataManager` and `BasePartitionUpsertMetadataManager` contains the general logic of upsert handling independent of the back storage.\r\nAt StarTree we already have the pluggable off-heap upsert metadata manager, which proves that the current model works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1732749747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1732751214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11659#issuecomment-1732751214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11659","id":1732751214,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5nR69u","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-25T01:07:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T01:07:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Trying to understand the problem.

The reason is explained in the deprecation note of https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk. Openjdk is not production ready. It is the image that is created from the master branch of openjdk repo. That means that openjdk will only create images for the first 6 months for each version, even LTS. For example, Java 21 images won't be created once Java 22 is released.\r\n\r\nThat is why we choose to use either Temurin (old adoptjdk), Microsoft or Corretto. As of today, only Corretto provides a Java 21 image, so that is the one I've chosen here. We can change to Temurin once it is released in order to have an homogeneous pipeline. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1733038211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1733050685","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11120#issuecomment-1733050685","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11120","id":1733050685,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5nTEE9","user":{"login":"Jackie-Jiang","id":17555551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU1NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17555551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jackie-Jiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jackie-Jiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-25T07:09:19Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T07:09:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Decided to split this into multiple PRs.

Therefore it seems that #11672 is better as it is less _hacky_ and closer to the actual pipeline we would like to have once Java 21 is fully supported.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1733254412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1733256695","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/11659#issuecomment-1733256695","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/11659","id":1733256695,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5nT2X3","user":{"login":"t0mpere","id":24777707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Nzc3NzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24777707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere","html_url":"https://github.com/t0mpere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mpere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-25T09:22:35Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T09:23:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok so misunderstanding from my side. I thought both indexes could be disabled and the column still be used in AGG fuctions. I'm trying to reduce the space used by this column. It's very high cardinality and it contains a 12 bit HLL state. Something like ```0000000c00000aac000000000<many zeros...>00``` what do you think would be the best configuration for a column like this?\r\nWhat I've tried so far, for 30mb of data:\r\n- no dictionary = 2GB fwd index\r\n- raw = ~1GB fwd index + dictionary\r\n- inverted = ~1GB fwd index\r\n\r\nI'm wandering if I'm doing something wrong here, how would I enable lz4 compression on the fwd index? `\"noDictionaryConfig\": {\"hll_column\": \"LZ4\"}` seem to have no effects after a reload. Do I have to refresh all segments to make it work? Is it because it's a metrics column? What if i switch to a dimension column, would it enable lz4 by default? (seems to be the case from the documentation). Also is there a way to check if compression is actually used?
