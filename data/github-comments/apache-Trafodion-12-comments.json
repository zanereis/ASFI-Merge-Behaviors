Those contain a cardinality and a max. cardinality (Context::getInputLogProp()->getMaxCardEst()). Both of these cardinalities should be in the range of the min. and max. cardinality established by constraints.\n\nIMHO it would be better if we would check that max cardinality instead of passing another object down to the right child of the join.\n\nThere are multiple other questions I have with the current solution, but first I want to find out whether you are ok with this solution.\n\nIdeally we should guarantee that estimated and max. cardinality should always be within the cardinality boundaries established by constraints (GroupAttr::hasCardConstraint()), but I couldn't find any code that ensures that - maybe I just didn't look carefully enough. Anyway, that could be handled through a separate JIRA, if necessary. For now I would assume that this is the case.\n\nMy apologies for being late, I should have thought about it and commented earlier on!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158219558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158232574","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/174#issuecomment-158232574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/174","id":158232574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODIzMjU3NA==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-19T23:26:01Z","updated_at":"2015-11-19T23:26:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Please do not merge this change while I investigate Hans' suggestion.

Kevin that it is a no-harm fix. But, the variation between the time of the nodes can cause lot more problems in hbase. See https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2011/04/hbase-dos-and-donts/. With Trafodion, we let hbase to add the timestamp  when a row is inserted/deleted/updated. The variation in time impacts in general and more so when the query involves ESP processes running on different nodes. This can cause the rows to disappear or reappear unintentionally. Hence, I feel fixing this issue at DCS level might be no-harm for DCS, but it won't help the overall state of the cluster with the variation in time of the nodes. I would give +0 for this fix tending more towards -1.

Can you please work to get these benchmarks done and ensure that there is no memory growth in T2 driver.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158532337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158543477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/182#issuecomment-158543477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/182","id":158543477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODU0MzQ3Nw==","user":{"login":"sandhyasun","id":12959766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU5NzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12959766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun","html_url":"https://github.com/sandhyasun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandhyasun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-20T22:26:50Z","updated_at":"2015-11-20T22:26:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158543477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158574446","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/183#issuecomment-158574446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/183","id":158574446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODU3NDQ0Ng==","user":{"login":"arvind-narain","id":8054653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTQ2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8054653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain","html_url":"https://github.com/arvind-narain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arvind-narain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-21T01:54:37Z","updated_at":"2015-11-21T01:54:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"jenkins, retest -- failure in test162, not related -

Actually I don't think there's necessary that we keep them coexist. The purpose of this change is eliminate the old libs with Nv44 suffix. Although they coexist on my dev machine, but I never used the old ones since I changed this. To make them coexist, we need two edition of the make file and packaging script? Or introduce some env var allow developers to switch between the new and the old? That will be more confusing... So my opinion is we must update our dev environment. Since the traf_tools_setup.sh script is updated as well, I think this won't be a difficult thing to do. Some contributors I know in Shanghai have changed this and keep using it for a while, and run smoothly.\n\nIf you really have difficult to update your environments, I think I will have no choice but close this PR...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158873059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158981668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/177#issuecomment-158981668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/177","id":158981668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODk4MTY2OA==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T16:09:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T16:09:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New Check Test Started: https://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/130/\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/158981668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/159010244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/96#issuecomment-159010244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/96","id":159010244,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTAxMDI0NA==","user":{"login":"svarnau","id":5273190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzMxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5273190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau","html_url":"https://github.com/svarnau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T17:51:11Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T17:51:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ryzuo, I think there is a mis-communication on the point of co-existence of the new/old libraries. As you say there is no need for the new version of code to be able to switch back and forth. There is need, however, for old versions of code to be able to be built/tested on the same machines. \n\nThis is necessary for the transition period so that every workspace on a development machine does not have to update at the same time. More importantly, it is also needed to be able to support an old release of code.\n\nWe went through several rounds of trying to have both sets of libraries in the same directory, but a cleaner way will be to just have the new libraries at a different path. Then when the new change comes in it changes where we look for ICU libraries, such as TOOLSDIR/icu44_2.  That enables the old code to coexist on the same machine.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/159010244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/159025329","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/177#issuecomment-159025329","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/177","id":159025329,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTAyNTMyOQ==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T18:47:40Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T18:47:40Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Test

fix looks ok to me, but after spending an hour or two trying to understand what's going on in MDAM costing I still don't have much of a clue. The code seems nicely structured and modular, but the comments mostly explain what each method does, not what doing that means. What it does I can see from the code, too, but figuring out what it means is much harder. The ColumnOrderList::getSingleSubsetOrderForMDAM() method (file mdam.cpp) seems to allow any range specs in the prefix column. This seems good to me, but it also seems to contradict what the method does with IN lists (which are just another flavor or RangeSpecs). All this may be wrong, due my limited understanding, and it is not directly related to this specific fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/159428555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/159428639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/177#issuecomment-159428639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/177","id":159428639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTQyODYzOQ==","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-24T22:38:47Z","updated_at":"2015-11-24T22:38:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is
