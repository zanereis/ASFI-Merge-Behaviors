So it would be okay to simplify your logic to return 0 when SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL occurs rather than use a separate \"breakout\" statement - however what's there does the same thing AND it passed all the tests... so maybe leave it as is.\r\n\r\nI'll merge this.  I spent a fair amount of time analyzing the change and flow.  I believe it is okay.  We don't do a lot of unexpected disconnection testing in any of our test suites which is a testing gap.  I'm sure many of these error-handling branches never get hit in the test suite.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/386060227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/386347321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1550#issuecomment-386347321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1550","id":386347321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjM0NzMyMQ==","user":{"login":"jfarrell","id":770483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/770483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/jfarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfarrell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-03T16:03:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T16:03:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"travis failed due to unrelated issue on a non-py job\r\n\r\n```\r\n; /root/.cache/common-lisp/sbcl-1.4.5-linux-x64/thrift/src/tutorial/cl/gen-cl/shared/shared-types-tmpGHU3ALSW.fasl written\r\n; /root/.cache/common-lisp/sbcl-1.4.5-linux-x64/thrift/src/tutorial/cl/gen-cl/shared/shared-types-tmpGHU3ALSV.fasl written\r\n; compilation finished in 0:00:00.137\r\n; compilation finished in 0:00:00.138\r\nUnhandled SB-INT:SIMPLE-FILE-ERROR in thread #<SB-THREAD:THREAD \"main thread\" RUNNING\r\n                                                {10005605B3}>:\r\n  Failed to find the TRUENAME of /root/.cache/common-lisp/sbcl-1.4.5-linux-x64/thrift/src/tutorial/cl/gen-cl/shared/shared-types.fasl:\r\n    No such file or directory\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/386347321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/387234414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1550#issuecomment-387234414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1550","id":387234414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzIzNDQxNA==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-07T23:12:14Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T23:12:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jfarrell that is an intermittent problem in the lisp solution and we need to engage the original folks who added it to help resolve it.

don't think we have a danger with this. The underlying net socket will not get reset, just the wrapping buffered transport. Calling `reset()` on the buffered_transport instance that is responsible for writing will only throw out its internal outBuffers in this case, which will only have up to 1 message at a time before flushing it to the net socket (flush is called at the end of send_Foo RPC call in the generated service module). Since this try/catch is catching serialization errors to the outBuffers, the only thing that would ever be thrown out is this corrupt half-message in the transports outBuffer, which we won't need anymore since serialization has failed.\r\n\r\nNode will only serialize and send one message at a time, since constructing the message into the outbuffer and flushing to the socket is done synchronously.

Fortunately Thrift uses the identifying number and not the name of the item for fields, but not so for names of structures, etc.  So it is possible someone might run into issues in the future adding output for more languages and need to change their thrift file, and need to change other implementations.\r\n\r\nMitigation for this will be to get a list of keywords into every compiler-language implementation and instruct folks to generate code for each language they expect to use, to check for keyword violations early.\r\n\r\nIt's still not exactly how Thrift is supposed to operate, which is to offer the lowest common denominator across all languages, which really leads us to want to put the entire list of reserved keywords into the .ll file as they were, but grow the list to include keywords for all languages.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear from some other long-time thrifters on this approach and see what they think... should the list of language keywords be language specific or global?  Should we perhaps have the list of keywords be additive in the compiler code so that we end up with one big list we're checking regardless of language output?  \r\n\r\nI like the idea of keeping the keywords in language-specific implementation files, but perhaps when the compiler starts up it should load them from all the languages and check them.  It could even be smart enough to identify the language the keyword is used in so that the output message can be more specific, i.e. \"sample.thrift:46: portability violation: keyword 'true' is reserved by cpp, lua, perl, php and cannot be used here.\" (just an example, may not be correct).\r\n\r\nThat could be done with a std::map<std::string, std::set<std::string> > where the value is a set of language names that reserve the keyword and this map would be updated by each compiler language implementation as it is loaded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400661631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400663675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1564#issuecomment-400663675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1564","id":400663675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDY2MzY3NQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T13:03:00Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T13:03:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CI

If we check for all keywords across all languages up front it avoids future surprises.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400765882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400785692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1567#issuecomment-400785692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1567","id":400785692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDc4NTY5Mg==","user":{"login":"nsrtvwls","id":655351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTM1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/655351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls","html_url":"https://github.com/nsrtvwls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsrtvwls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T18:33:18Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T18:42:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It can definitely be a problem. E.g. service function cannot be renamed transparently.  On the other hand, a global list of keywords is hard to maintain. What if thrift decides to support a new language with another set of keywords? Adding to the global list will break things to people who don't even care about this new language.\r\nI like the idea of merging keyword lists from all active generators. Will it work if I show a warning, not an error if an identifier is a keyword in some language that is supported but is not used for generation?\r\nBut as far as I understand, generators don't know anything about source files and line numbers, so it's not easy to generate the detailed message as \"sample.thrift:46: portability violation...\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400785692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400793119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1567#issuecomment-400793119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1567","id":400793119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDc5MzExOQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-27T18:58:16Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T18:58:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's probably why it was in the parser to begin with, because one could emit the line number where the error occurred.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/400793119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
