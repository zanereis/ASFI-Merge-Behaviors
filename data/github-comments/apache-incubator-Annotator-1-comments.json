I don't think it makes sense to clog up this repo with packaging boilerplate for every package repository that someone wants to get annotator from.\r\n\r\nAs for what to do with Tiki and annotator.js, I can't say yet. I don't have time to work on this and annotator.js right now. I have thought about rebooting Annotator.js as an application built on the Apache Annotator libraries, but we're not there yet and Annotator.js probably needs new maintainers for this to happen.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/322279089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/324040359","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/pull/10#issuecomment-324040359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/10","id":324040359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDA0MDM1OQ==","user":{"login":"BigBlueHat","id":43209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat","html_url":"https://github.com/BigBlueHat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-22T14:17:02Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T14:17:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Huge thanks for this work @tilgovi and for the review @Treora!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/324040359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/comments/324041647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/7#issuecomment-324041647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-annotator/issues/7","id":324041647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNDA0MTY0Nw==","user":{"login":"BigBlueHat","id":43209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat","html_url":"https://github.com/BigBlueHat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BigBlueHat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-22T14:21:05Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T14:21:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sorry for the delayed response!\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that http://annotator.apache.org/ was insufficient? üòÉ \r\n\r\nWe're focused first on building browser libraries for working with [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) documents.

It's beyond inefficient, but it's what happens when you cram to trees together...\r\n\r\nSo, from your example, you'd end up with something like this (pseudo code here also):\r\n```html\r\n<p><mark data-anno-id=\"3\">Something </mark><mark data-anno-id=\"1\"><mark data-anno-id=\"3\"><mark data-anno-id=\"2\">is</mark></mark><mark data-anno-id=\"3\"> here</mark></mark></p>\r\n\r\n<p><mark data-anno-id=\"345\">And there's more text</mark> down here</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLovely, right? üòâ The text in each selection would be:\r\n1. \"is\"\r\n2. \"is here\"\r\n3. \"Something is here And there's more text\"\r\n\r\nPresented as a tree this looks like:\r\n```html\r\n<p>\r\n  <mark data-anno-id=\"3\">Something </mark>\r\n  <mark data-anno-id=\"1\">\r\n    <mark data-anno-id=\"3\">\r\n      <mark data-anno-id=\"2\">is</mark>\r\n    </mark>\r\n    <mark data-anno-id=\"3\"> here</mark>\r\n  </mark>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <mark data-anno-id=\"345\">And there's more text</mark>\r\n  down here\r\n</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe DOM will think of (and treat) several of these `<mark>` tags as parents or children of other `<mark>` tags. The annotation software, however, would treat them as unrelated and remove/add/change their occurrences wherever they're found.

years ago, there was http://xpointerlib.mozdev.org a Firefox add-on used for Annotea, that would insert into DOM elements to highlight annotations, while marking those nodes to be ignored in further operations, such that multiple annotations would still more or less anchor. \r\n\r\nSee `function isMarkedIgnore(element)` in

Schemas were developed almost 2 years ago using then current versions of node.js and ajv  (another json validator - https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv). Updating to newer version of json schema will allow some simplifications (avoid, for example, double negatives when checking arrays). \r\n\r\nPlease note the reliance on 'referenced' schemas, i.e., the actual schema confirming that an annotation meets a requirement of the Web Annotation Data Model typically relies on 2 or 3 referenced schemas which live in different file(s) and are shared across multiple schemas (https://github.com/w3c/web-annotation-tests/tree/master/definitions). Ajv makes it easy to load referenced schemas asynchronously (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv#asynchronous-schema-compilation). \r\n\r\nAlso, there are known to be mistakes in 2 or 3 of the schemas (will pass an incorrect annotation or fail a correct annotation), but these only show up in truly edge cases of the data model and will be easy to fix at a later time. \r\n\r\nI'm not currently a committer on annotator-incubator, but happy to help if any questions about the schemas themselves or if there's anything else I can help with. Happy also to take another run at my management to get approvals necessary to be added as a committer for the incubator. \r\n\r\n@BigBlueHat sounds like Saturday hack work went well.
