Changes include\r\n1. Make `StateRegistry` to be `SharedStateRegistry` where only shared states are registered. Now the `discardState()` method is supposed to delete those private states in the checkpoint.\r\n2. `SharedStateRegistry` now is deployed by the `CheckpointCoordinator`. The state handle will register its shared states once it is received by the coordinator. In another words, all shared states in a completed checkpoint are registered when the checkpoint is added into the `CompletedCheckpointStore`.  All checkpoints (including savepoints) will unregister shared states when they are removed from the store. Savepoints should not contain any shared state. Therefore the unregistration will not discard any state in the savepoints.\r\n3. When recovering from failures or restarting from a savepoint, the `CheckpointCoordinator` will rebuild the registry with the checkpoints recovered in the `CompletedCheckpointStore`.\r\n4. Related tests are added to ensure correctness.\r\n5.

IMO, if the exception stored in an Execution is also the root exception in the EG then the timestamps should match to be consistent and not give off the impression that these are unrelated/different. To that end the Execution has to supply the Exception as well as the timestamp. We could create the ErrorInfo directly in the Execution and pass that on instead of just the exception.

Regarding the 2 approaches for handing data in process windows, I would say that the price to pay for serializing/deserializing the whole list of events is matched by (serializing/deserializing the timestamp keys + independently deserializing the events that need to be removed). Considering that the performance are similar personally I believe that the approach with Queue is preferred because we can actually gain something (i.e., the order of the events) which will be helpful in extending the implementation for full SQL\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289099946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289107312","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3609#issuecomment-289107312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3609","id":289107312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTEwNzMxMg==","user":{"login":"rtudoran","id":16573790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTczNzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16573790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran","html_url":"https://github.com/rtudoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rtudoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-24T18:27:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-24T18:27:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fhueske @twalthr @sunjincheng121 @shijinkui @stefanobortoli @hongyuhong\r\n\r\nI have made a first implementation draft for supporting inner queries mainly when operating on processing time.

@rtudoran,\r\n\r\nthanks for doing the benchmark and posting the numbers! The recommended state backend for production settings is the RocksDB backend (see [production-readiness docs](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/ops/production_ready.html#choice-of-state-backend)). The in-memory backends store state as objects on the heap and can easily kill the JVM with an OutOfMemoryError. Also the in-memory backends do not de/serialize data, so there is not an actual advantage is using the MapState which was mainly motivated by the reduced serialization effort. There are plans to implement a state backend using managed memory (similar to the batch algorithms). This backend would also serialize and deserialize data to/from pre-allocated byte arrays. So optimizing for de/serialization makes sense, IMO.\r\n\r\nThe `KeyedOneInputStreamOperatorTestHarness` is part of the `flink-streaming-java` test-jar artifact.

This is for the purpose of discussion, to show that we are spending thoughts on this topic for a while now.\r\n\r\nIn case of the row range and procTime, the \"serialization savings\" coming from MapState exists up to the point in which the \"buffer\" is filled. After that that, we need to start retracting to keep the value correct and to do that, we need to deserialize all the objects. as @rtudoran mentioned, we implemented a version using a Queue object.\r\n\r\nThis has many advantages:\r\n- removing the object from the buffer at the right moment freeing memory on the go (without any iteration over the key set) \r\n- has the data access pattern of O(1) without any \"key resolution costs\" and no list iteration\r\n- keeps the natural processing order by design, without the need of indexing objects with timestamps\r\n- the experiments we run show that there are no differences for windows up to 100k elements, and after that the queue seems to be more efficient (as the the key resolution does not come for free). \r\n\r\nThe map state may have a slight advantage in the early stages, when the window is not filled, but after it just introduces useless operations. Furthermore, the need to index objects with a created timestamp (more memory wasted), dealing with a sequential access (List) to get the most recent object when you can actually just use the natural arrival order seems useless complication. Applying the Occam Razor there should be no doubt on which solution we should be selecting first. The serialization optimization while window gets filled sounds like a premature optimization not worth in the long run. The further implementation of SQL operators (e.g. LIMIT, OFFSET etc)  can just benefit from the fact that the state is already sorted, whereas the map would need to be sorted all the time. \r\n\r\nOf course I am talking specifically of the procTime semantic operations. eventTime is another story anyway. The map state has minor advantages in the beginning (as anyway the serialization costs are small), the queue state as advantages in executions running steadily because of access pattern and natural buffer cleansing.  \r\n\r\nThese are my two cents on the discussion\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289382529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289383698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3600#issuecomment-289383698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3600","id":289383698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTM4MzY5OA==","user":{"login":"zhengcanbin","id":26545140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTQ1MTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26545140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengcanbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengcanbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T08:13:22Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T08:13:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@EronWright @vijikarthi ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289383698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289388645","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3574#issuecomment-289388645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3574","id":289388645,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTM4ODY0NQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T08:35:23Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T08:35:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @huawei-flink, thanks for your detailed explanation. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of the MapState are that we only need to deserialize all keys and not all rows as in the ValueState or ListState case. Identifying the smallest key (as needed for OVER ROWS) is basically for free. Once the smallest key has been found, we only need to deserialize the rows that need to be retracted. All other rows are not touched at all. \r\n\r\nThe benchmarks that @rtudoran ran were done with an in-memory state backend, which does not de/serialize data but keeps the state as objects on the heap. I think the numbers would be different if you would switch to the RocksDB state backend which serializes all data (RocksDB is the only state backend recommended for production settings). In fact, I would read from the result of the benchmarks that sorting the keys does not have a major impact on the performance. Another important aspect of the design is that RocksDB iterates of the the map keys in order, so even sorting (or rather ensuring a sorted order) becomes O(n). \r\n\r\nI do see the benefits of keeping data in order, but de/serialization is one of the major costs when processing data on the JVM and it makes a lot of sense to optimize for reduced de/serialization overhead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289388645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/289391797","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3600#issuecomment-289391797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3600","id":289391797,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTM5MTc5Nw==","user":{"login":"Rucongzhang","id":13606366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA2MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13606366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/Rucongzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rucongzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T08:49:26Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T08:49:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhengcanbin ,@StephanEwen ,@shijinkui.

After some back and forth offline discussions with others on how exactly we want to proceed with this, we decided to stick with using union state to cope with the shard discovery on restore problem (at least for 1.3.0). Therefore, we can finally continue work here :-D\r\n\r\nFirst of all, to use union state, instead of `ListCheckpointed`, we should use `CheckpointedFunction` instead. There is a PR for exposing union state to the public API (#3508), but in case that isn't merged yet within the next few days, I suggest that you don't need to be blocked when you continue your work on this PR. For now, you can cast the operator state store instance retrieved through the `FunctionInitializationContext` to `DefaultOperatorStateStore` to use union state.\r\n\r\nOne thing to also note, which is missing in you previous work on this, is that we need a migration path from the old state access (i.e., via `CheckpointedAsynchronously`) to the new state (i.e. `CheckpointedFunction`).\r\n\r\nThe `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase` class in the Kafka connector provides a very good example of how to do this. Simply put, in the end, the `FlinkKinesisConsumer` should implement both the legacy `CheckpointedRestoring` and `CheckpointedFunction`, and bridge the old state read from the legacy `restoreState(...)` method to the new `initializeState(...)` method.

Your observation of the problem is correct. \r\n\r\nActually I'm also working on refactoring the usage of the ZooKeeper based leader election and retrieval services. The respective issue is [FLINK-6078](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-6078). The problem is not only creating a single curator framework but also preventing the leader retrieval and election services from closing it when shutting down the respective service. Moreover, we should use the newly introduced `HighAvailabilityServices` as a factory for the services. That way the service instantiation can be controlled from a single place.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I think that we can close this PR. I will open a PR for FLINK-6078 in the next days.
