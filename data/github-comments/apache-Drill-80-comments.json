Since we stream rather than buffer REST API query results now, we no longer have an excuse for runaway heap usage. Further, while preventing the next REST query from running can save the Drillbit from an OOM death, when the user complains that they cannot run their query an admin is very likely to restart that Drillbit _anyway_. So we probably only delayed the inevitable even though the landing was made a bit softer and other processing on the Drillbit may have been able to continue a bit longer.\r\n\r\nSince now the only things that can cause runaway heap usage (that I can see) under a constant load are leaks, unecessary object references in Java's case, I think we should bite the bullet and fail hard with OOM when we exhaust the heap. The Drillbit can easily be reincarnated upon its death by systemd, k8s or another supervisor, which is preferable to having it limp on declining queries arriving over REST. We also get to stop applying our own heap management rule which may interact badly with the GC in use. E.g. if we start turning REST queries away at 85% heap usage but 90% heap usage would have stirred the user's GC to do a deep clean (in reality I think they all kick in considerably earlier but I'm really making a design argument here) then we are working against our own JVM. Lastly any ensuing bug reports overtly containing \"OutOfMemoryError\" are more likely, I believe, to send us hunting heap memory leaks.\r\n\r\ncc @paul-rogers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1193118355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1193245110","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2585#issuecomment-1193245110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2585","id":1193245110,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5HH3m2","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-24T04:34:06Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T04:34:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnturton Thank you very much for your review of this beast.

Once again the temptation was just too much to resist. This job is not that heavy and it only runs when commits reach master which is not partiicularly often. It's also nice to be able to manually launch the snapshot publishing indepedently.

For my part I'm supportive of backporting because I don't like the idea of a classloader time bomb ticking away in 1.20. As an alternative, 1.20 could remain on the thin driver but start distributing its own build of it with the needed Avatica relocations applied.
