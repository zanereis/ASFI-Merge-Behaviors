Considering that the synax of _MySQL_ CALL _Statement_  is `CALL sp_name([parameter[,...]])`,in my opinion `MySQLCallStatement` class should add two properties: `procedureName`  and `parameters`,the codes are  as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ToString\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Getter\r\npublic final class MySQLCallStatement extends CallStatement implements MySQLStatement {\r\n\r\n    private String procedureName;\r\n\r\n    private List<ExpressionSegment> parameters;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.  The Synax of _MySQL_ DO_Statement_  is `DO expr [, expr] ...,so i think `MySQLDoStatement` class should add one propertie: `expressionSegments` ,the codes are as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ToString\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Getter\r\npublic final class MySQLDoStatement extends DoStatement implements MySQLStatement {\r\n\r\n    private List<ExpressionSegment> expressionSegments;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n3.

I'm on the same boat with @sabz90 with same setup and same issue. I didn't attempt to update sharding key. When `update` with JPA/Hibernate, the sharding key is not included in the where clause and the error message stated `Can not update sharding key`.  Moreover, it seems all similar issues were closed without a proper solution. such as #5596 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/714243404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/714247433","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7703#issuecomment-714247433","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/7703","id":714247433,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDI0NzQzMw==","user":{"login":"heqiao","id":3125184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjUxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3125184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao","html_url":"https://github.com/heqiao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heqiao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-22T05:53:16Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T05:53:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"There is indeed a workaround - Embed the primary key and sharding key on the entity level.

for the detailed response with a solution. @tristaZero \r\n\r\nThat's exactly what was happening. When `updatable = false` is being used, the `where clause` does not contain `shardingKey=xx` and will end up with all shards updating.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `where clause` only contains `pk =yy` no matter `updatable = false` is being used or not. \r\n\r\nThe logic in the third paragraph makes a lot sense to me. Just want to make sure the sharding key will be included in `where clause` in the PASS cases.
