Sorry for those mistakes, I would take care of it next time.\n2. About resourceManager, I adopt ResourceManager<WorkerType extends TaskExecutorRegistration> extends RpcEndpoint<ResourceManagerGateway> at first time, but it would fail because of an Exception when I wanna to start a subClass of this ResourceManager. For example, public class StandaloneResourceManager extends ResourceManager<TaskExecutorRegistration>, when I start this ResourceManager, it would call AkkaRpcService.#startServer, an exception would be thrown here because selfGatewayType was mistake for TaskExecutorRegistration class. So I change it to ResourceManager<ResourceManagerGateway, WorkerType extends TaskExecutorRegistration> extends

Will also correct the issue tag ;-)\n\nI have no good idea how to test this, though, so any thoughts there are welcome!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/250157370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/250160771","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2546#issuecomment-250160771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2546","id":250160771,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDE2MDc3MQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T13:06:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T13:06:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All in all some minor change requests, otherwise this seems good.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/250160771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/250162337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2546#issuecomment-250162337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2546","id":250162337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDE2MjMzNw==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-28T13:13:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T13:13:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, let me take a step back and understand a few things deeper, first.\nWho actually generates the watermarks (in ingestion time)?

If I understand correctly, your suggestion is to make the test something like the following: 1) put the split in the reader 2) read the split 3) when the split finishes update the time in the provider 4) observe the time in the output elements. If this is the case, then the problem is that the reader just puts the split in a queue, and this is picked up by another thread that reads it. In this context, there is no way of knowing when the reading thread has finished reading the split and goes to the next one. So step 3) cannot be synchronized correctly. This is the reason I am just having a thread in the test that tries (without guarantees - the race condition you mentioned) to update the time while the reader is still reading.

When i wrote the first version of the SlotManager, i have noticed maybe i made things too complicated, but i didn't figure out how to make things more simplify. \n\nAs it turns out, your modification covered two main problems i have faced:\n1. What information to exchange during heartbeats, and what actions should we take\n2. What action should we take when the allocation failed at TaskManager\nBut what i really want to find out is: In this case, is there a simple paradigm which we can follow to make whole thing clear and robust. What i previous choose is: Take actions based on my newest runtime information. But as you can see, it leads me to a very complex solution, each time i decide what action should be taken, i should to check all related information and consider all possibilities. (even it seems hard to understand why that will happen).\n\nYour modification gives me some tips, maybe we can simplify it with following ways:\n1. RM and TM only exchange information when needed ( so heartbeat dont sync status )\n2. TM only report informations which it can changed by itself ( like slot be free again )\n\nHere is some thoughts about the modification:\n1. We can remove the update status part entirely, since it can only do new slot registration now, we can just move it to the task executor first registration.\n2. Once a slot becomes free in TM, notify RM\n3. TM should attach the slot usage when rejecting the allocation from RM\n\nHere is some minor problems i found in this modification:\na. As beyond1920 metioned, we dont have a way to find out a slot becomes free ( this can be done by 2)\nb. When we handleSlotRequestFailedAtTaskManager, we will make this slot free again. If the slot is occupied by some other task now, we will continuously failed for all allocation on this slot.

A projection is a very well-defined operation: create a graph where there is an edge between any pair of vertices with a common neighbor in the bipartite graph. If the user wants to apply mappers or other transformations on the vertices and edges, they can do so afterwards, using the graph methods. The problem is that with a projection, some information is lost, e.g. the edge values. For these cases, we can provide a custom projection method where we give the labels in a flattened tuple as @greghogan suggested, but I'm afraid the API will look ugly with a Tuple8 there. Another, maybe friendlier solution, would be attaching the labels on the projection graph edges.

We can change that by explicitly reporting to the RM if a slot becomes free. This may also decrease latency in case a tasks finishes and new ones are waiting to be deployed.\n\n> b. When we handleSlotRequestFailedAtTaskManager, we will make this slot free again. If the slot is occupied by some other task now, we will continuously failed for all allocation on this slot.

When allocation fails, it is marked as free and then the request is retried immediately. It must succeed eventually if the initial decision to allocate the slot was correct. However, we need to explicitly check if a TaskExecutor has deregistered, to make sure old TaskExecutors don't send failures which triggers slot allocation of already removed slots (due to TaskExecutor deregistration).

Move the slot registration and allocation report to the registration of the TaskExecutor\n2. Let the TaskExecutor immediately notify the ResourceManager once a slot becomes free\n3.

Either a reply from the TaskExecutor, or a timeout/error which is returned by the future. If the request is then retried, the TaskExecutor receives the same request twice but will simply acknowledge it again. The ResourceManager just keeps retrying. In the worst case, the TaskExecutor has already freed the slot again because the JobManager doesn't need it anymore. If the TaskExecutor then reports that the slot is available again, we know that we can stop retrying.\n\nThis requires us to keep an extra list of unconfirmed requests to the TaskExecutor. If the request is still unconfirmed when the slot is free again or occupied by a different allocation, we can cancel the retrying and delete the unconfirmed request. This is slightly more complicated than I initially thought :) \n\nThere is one more problem thought. How to prevent a false request from the ResourceManager to the TaskExecutor in case the ResourceManager hasn't received a reply from the TaskExecutor but the TaskExecutor has already removed the slot again (i.e. task has finished)? The slot would be allocated although it is not needed anymore.\n\nNote that sending back a current allocation list when declining a request does not cover the case in which a slot has already been released again. The TaskExecutor may have tried to decline a request and have failed. In the meantime, the ResourceManager sends the same request again. This results in a second (duplicate) slot allocation.\n\nAgain, the only solution for this problem seems to be to keep a list of unconfirmed slot allocation removal requests at the TaskExecutor. The ResourceManager has to acknowledge all slot allocation removals. The TaskExecutor can then de-duplicate any requests for slots that it hasn't received a confirmation for its removal message.\n\nActually, it should suffice to have only one list with unconfirmed slot allocation removals at the TaskExecutor. The ResourceManager doesn't need a list to filter because it relies on the TaskExecutor to filter duplicate requests correctly.\n\n**TL;DR**\nI think we need to change the PR title 😏 Long story short, in addition to the proposed previously discussed changes, we need the ResourceManager to confirm slot allocation removals by the TaskExecutor. The TaskExecutor has to keep around previous allocation ids of freed slots to de-duplicate any old incoming slot requests from the ResourceManager.\n\nThank you so much for your feedback. Please tell me if anything is unclear.

Actually, i noticed that right after i posted the previous reply, as it turns out, my solution was exactly the same as you proposed! \n\nSome comments inline:\n\n> It is guaranteed that the ResourceManager will receive an RPC response of some sort. Either a reply from the TaskExecutor, or a timeout/error which is returned by the future. If the request is then retried, the TaskExecutor receives the same request twice but will simply acknowledge it again\n\nI think it's no need to stick to the failed slot when the allocation fails by rpc. Just put it back to the free pool, and give us another shot. Actually, i think the pending requests acts like your extra list of unconfirmed requests. (And you pointed at last, we actually dont need this list as TaskManager will correct our faultd by rejecting allocation).\n\n> There is one more problem thought. How to prevent a false request from the ResourceManager to the TaskExecutor in case the ResourceManager hasn't received a reply from the TaskExecutor but the TaskExecutor has already removed the slot again\n\nWhen the allocation fails by rpc and we only have one free slot, it's true that we will keep retrying the same slot and keeping failing by rpc. Util the task are finished, the slot becomes free again, then our request reached TaskManager (what a bad luck). In this situation , i think it's ok for TaskManager to just accept the request, In the end, JobManager will do the work for us by rejecting the slot offer. So we will get the free slot again.\n\n> Again, the only solution for this problem seems to be to keep a list of unconfirmed slot allocation removal requests at the TaskExecutor. \n\nYes, i also thought this might be a solution. And i think this can work with the Heartbeat manager, since if you cannot send the free message to RM, you will not be able to send heartbeat too. After some timeout, RM will treat the TaskManager as dead, and some garbage collection logic in RM will take care all the allocations and slots which belong to this TaskManager. \n\nAll in all,  I think this version is still much simpler than the first one. :smirk:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/250767589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/250785094","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2467#issuecomment-250785094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2467","id":250785094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDc4NTA5NA==","user":{"login":"iampeter","id":713801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzgwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter","html_url":"https://github.com/iampeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iampeter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-30T16:08:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T16:08:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, that's better @mushketyk, but I think would be even better if you did not identify the elements explicitly by ids ('#canvas', '#job-panel'), but have the directive contain the two splitable parts, i.e.:\n\n```\n<split>\n  <div>Upper part</div>\n  <div>Lower part</div>\n</split>\n```\n\nand just use the first and second child to identify them.
