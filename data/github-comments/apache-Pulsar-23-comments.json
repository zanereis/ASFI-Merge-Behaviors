Code changes look fine in general - except for once comment about using \"throw\"\r\n\r\nWe're using \"throw\" in all other parameters validation already. The reasons why `throw` is generally preferable to `assert()` are:\r\n\r\n 1. With throw we can put a message to why we did it\r\n 2. Asserts are removed when compiling with `-DNDEBUG` in release binaries (I don't think we use that flag, though is a very common practice)\r\n 3. Asserts are used to validated programmer's assumptions for conditions that should never happen, not for parameter validations\r\n\r\n> I was thinking of a different approach - divide the maxPendingMessages and receiveQueueSize by number or partitions with min as 100 (or some other number)\r\n> i want to avoid adding another two parameters (one in producer and consumer each)\r\n\r\nWe still need to give a chance to override the limits to accommodate unusual requirements.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/361664821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/361669521","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/1138#issuecomment-361669521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/1138","id":361669521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTY2OTUyMQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-30T17:28:18Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T17:28:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"After
