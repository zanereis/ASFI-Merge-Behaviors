If I leave out `<friend-packages>` completely then I loose two things:\r\n\r\n- I do not get any Javadoc produced, thus any adopter will not know what is possible to do. \r\n- I have no way way to \"document\" which packages I intend (in a controller manner for now, hence friend restriction) to be exposed, and which I intend not be exposed.\r\n\r\nIn other words: The friend declaration is a trick.

really have a specific friend that I can add, so `org.netbeans.core` kinda acts like a dummy in this

utility classes\r\n\r\n- Only the `org.netbeans.core.network.proxy.pac` package \r\n  should be exposed\r\n\r\n- Usage of interface/class should be unified:\r\n\r\n

Java Swing doesn't support SVG.

In other words it defeats the purpose. The legal question here is not what art-work of say a Safari logo we can use (there are lots to choose from and there are many which have a license compatible with Apache). Nope, the question is - as I understand it - if we can distribute with the release something which is a trademarked logo.

The `ExecutablePermissionsTest` checks if there is a `bin` directory with an\r\nexecutable `start.sh` in the user directory, after installing the `executable-permissions` NBM. \r\n\r\n    I'm currently using an installer in the NBM to create this file and make it executable.\r\nWhile this works, I'm not sure if this quite captures the essence of the test, or\r\nif it tries to verify some NBM specific behavior, like specifying an executable file\r\nin the manifest. (I could not find anything about this, that's why I went with the installer.)\r\n\r\n2. The `UpdateUnitFactoryTest.testGroupInstalledAndUpdates` test checks whether one of the installed modules has an update available in the `test-updates-provider` created in the test.\r\n\r\n     The problem I had here is, that there is no test module installed at this point, only real\r\nmodules, with correct specification versions.
