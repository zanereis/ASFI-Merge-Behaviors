The changes for Android X need to happen in new major versions of the plugins, which is beyond the scope of the Cordova 9 release.\r\n\r\n@dpogue I think this presents a problem for plugin authors such as myself since it is up to the Cordova project owner/plugin user as to whether they optionally enable AndroidX by manually adding the required properties to `gradle.properties` (see https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/350).\r\n\r\nA reason they may choose not to enable AndroidX is that other 3rd-party Cordova plugins on which their project depends have not been updated for AndroidX - many popular 3rd party plugins are poorly maintained.\r\n\r\nTherefore a new major plugin version that is updated for AndroidX will be ununsable in projects which have not been configured to use AndroidX: I can foresee a flood of issues opened against my plugins along the lines of \"AndroidX support broke my Cordova Android builds\". \r\n\r\nIf the next major version of `cordova-android` configured AndroidX to be enabled by default, this would be less of an issue because plugin authors could use `<engines>` in the `plugin.xml` to restrict the new major plugin version to a minimum of that latest version of `cordova-android`.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'm considering whether I can create a hook script which runs on plugin installation and depends on a plugin variable (i.e. `ANDROIDX_ENABLED=true|false`) which would dynamically replace the relevant class names in the Java source code and the `<framework>` elements in the `plugin.xml`.\r\nThis would enable a single version of my plugins to run both with or without AndroidX.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/482786154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/483573944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/75#issuecomment-483573944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/75","id":483573944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzU3Mzk0NA==","user":{"login":"GedasGa","id":18717889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzE3ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18717889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa","html_url":"https://github.com/GedasGa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GedasGa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-16T08:59:24Z","updated_at":"2019-04-16T08:59:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I
