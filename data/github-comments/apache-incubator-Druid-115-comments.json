I'm not hitting it with the new kafka-indexing-service.\nWe have an internal product which is similar to kafka, but with ability to rewind from old timestamp(kafka can only rewind from offset which is difficult to associate offset with a specified time point).\nWe have written a druid extension to read from it and remember the checkpoint after segment handoff.\nSometimes, we want to enlarge segmentGranularity to reduce segments number to lessen broker memory pressure, then we rewind from old time and rebuild segments (usually because we found the segmentGranularity is not properly configed).\nThe best way to resolve this issue is that we use CustomVersioningPolicy to always pass new timestamp as new version in our extension.\nBut we still think it is worth making broker can recover from \"overlap error\" by killing the new task, otherwise, all brokers are down in case someone else using druid hits this issue by mistake.\n\nBasically, there are some preconditions to hit this issue:\n1. enlarge segmentGranularity, like from hour to day\n2. using the default IntervalStartVersioningPolicy\n3. can rewind from old data timestamp to create the same interval start as version, like

i see, thanks for the detailed explanation. actually, to the best of my knowledge, none of the druid ingestions use interval start time as segment version and new segments always have higher versions. i'm not sure what else breaks down when that assumption is taken away.\n\nThat said, IntervalStartVersioningPolicy does exist in the code and I'm not sure when it would be used. if we do want to make the update then, I think, VersionedIntervalTimeline should be modified to handle the case of overlapping segments with same version.\n\ndoes anyone else have an opinion

after thinking about this some more I wonder if it's something we really want to support. Maybe having this query fail is OK, and it should actually fail with a more descriptive error. The reason is that naming output fields `__time` is problematic for features like,\n- nested queries: If the inner query has granularity \"hour\" and also has a dimension with outputName `__time`, and the outer query filters or groups on `__time`, is that referring to the timestamp of the inner rows or is it referring to the inner dimension named `__time`?\n- having specs: If a query has a metric with output name `__time`, and a having spec filters on `__time`, is that referring to the timestamp of the rows or to the metric named `__time`?\n\nCurrently I believe for nested queries it refers to the timestamp but for having specs it refers to the metric named `__time`. This is inconsistent and weird and I think there's the best answer is to disallow dimensions or metrics with output names of `__time`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/260151318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/260151999","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3684#issuecomment-260151999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3684","id":260151999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDE1MTk5OQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-12T22:13:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T22:13:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can see all of these issues come from the fact that groupBy results have anonymous timestamps in addition to actual named fields coming from dims and metrics and postaggregators. \"Higher level\" things like having specs and nested queries can access the timestamp by calling it `__time`, but that ends up shadowing any similarly named field from a dim or metric or postaggregator.\n\nAs a separate but related issue, I think nothing is really stopping anyone from defining a dimension and metric with the same output name.

While it's arguable if the load is a significant amount, the fact that it's a linear amount of load is what bothers me and the suggestion to consolidate on the coordinator was an attempt at making it a constant amount of load.
