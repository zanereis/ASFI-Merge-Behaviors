Will keep working on it, but here's my reasoning so far:\r\n\r\nafaik the workload data is only used the creation of fallback schedules.  e.g. [for creating the `\"tile_ow\"` parameter for spatial pack convolution](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/topi/x86/conv2d_avx_common.py#L54).\r\n \r\nSo I imagine I would want to create a test that has padding such that something like `\"tile_ow\"` is generated with an incorrect value, creating a schedule that causes an invalid transformation.\r\n\r\ne.g. `verify_conv2d_nchw(1, 64, 8, 128, 3, 1, (6, 6, 0, 0))`\r\n\r\nIf we are to focus on NCHWc convolution, which uses `\"tile_ow\"` in its schedule (via SplitEntity with `reg` in the `_fallback_schedule`) [`python/tvm/topi/x86/conv2d_avx_common.py#L119`](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/topi/x86/conv2d_avx_common.py#L119).   There is no value we can set `reg` or `\"tile_ow\"` to that will cause an invalid transformation, even through silly hardcoding like `out_width = 10000` or `ow_chunk, ow_block = s[C].split(ow, factor=10000)`\r\n\r\nIt always works.  Though perhaps it suffers a performance regression? \r\n\r\nIt could be happenstance that none of the conv2d schedules make transformations that are rendered invalid by having an incorrect value for the output height/width.  That being the case, I'm unsure how I would devise a test for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/749822386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/749830449","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7142#issuecomment-749830449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7142","id":749830449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTgzMDQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-22T23:17:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T23:17:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I see what you meant.

See in particular this great answer https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/3198#issuecomment-750346278\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that TVM's conversion rule for PyTorch NMS is definitely wrong and needs fixing. Here is my take away from the above discussion:\r\n\r\n* PyTorch detection model has two use of NMS - one in `ROIHead` and another in `RegionProposalNetwork`.\r\n* NMS scores in `ROIHead` are probability. There, they do score thresholding with user-chosen threshold before NMS. This NMS doesn't send boxes with negative scores to TVM.\r\n* NMS scores in `RegionProposalNetwork` correspond to \"objectness\" and they don't apply softmax or sigmoid to the output from objectness network. The scores are estimate of [logit function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) and negative logit totally makes sense - it just mean probability is < 0.5. So a  totally reasonable box can end up having a negative score. We **shouldn't** arbitrarily cut negative boxes from RPN.\r\n\r\nIt's highly possible that one of the reasons you didn't get the same output from pytorch detection models after compiling to TVM is due to this incorrect assumption we've been making about negative boxes, because RPN output in PyTorch/TVM are totally different - we are only considering only about half of them.\r\n\r\nThe good news is, I found a way to reduce the number of boxes that are sent to NMS. See these parameters https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/detection/mask_rcnn.py#L68-L71. They are something like `topk` parameter for each classes separately. The default is 1000, and there are five classes/levels in RPN NMS. So that explain why we are getting about 4500 boxes to RPN NMS. If we set the `rpn_pre_nms_top_n_train` to 200, we will get at most 1000 boxes, 200 boxes for each level in the feature pyramid. That will significantly make detection model go faster and still consider a lot of boxes to keep accuracy high.\r\n\r\nSo please take a look at the above issue in torchvision and my comment carefully and let's go ahead and merge this. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750438126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750438905","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7149#issuecomment-750438905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7149","id":750438905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDQzODkwNQ==","user":{"login":"antinucleon","id":1258974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTg5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1258974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon","html_url":"https://github.com/antinucleon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antinucleon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-23T19:22:03Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T19:22:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> One thing I missed on previous PRs, is that this is a new op.

Since the input shape is (batch_size, num_anchors, features), and features = 6 here, I wouldn't be surprised if checking the instance of k ends up reading all of the features of k into registers, and that memory read is the expensive operation. Once it's in memory, actually doing the iou calculation is relatively cheap, so skipping it doesn't help that much.\r\n\r\nThat's highly possible. Looking at this if condition in the triangle inner loop:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/9956b5b859a24c8f4dec1abf308723b1257ffc66/python/tvm/topi/cuda/nms.py#L535-L540\r\n\r\npreviously, `force_suppress` is always True, so this condition short circuit and access to `out[base_idx + offset_k + id_index]` and `out[base_idx + offset_j + id_index]` just below never happen. But now, to make NMS class aware, I had to change `force_suppress` to False, and now access to `out[base_idx + offset_k + id_index]` and `out[base_idx + offset_j + id_index]` always happen. This may be cancelling the speedup from reduced IOU tests. Storing the class IDs in a different 1D tensor may help. \r\n\r\nThat brings me to one of my pain points with our NMS API: I belieave our NMS API needs to be reworked. The current way of packing class ids and scores together with bbox coordinates is a design mistake that we inherited from MXNet. To store class ids, I have to cast ids to float32, update and pass `id_index` appropriately. Since our NMS API also requires scores to be packed with bbox, I had to update `score_index` too and all frontends except MXNet needs to do this concatenation. The worst part is that in NMS IR, the very first thing we do is the extraction 1D score tensor from packed data. So I see no good reason to pack score tensor and bbox coordinates.\r\n                            ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750589039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750694208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7137#issuecomment-750694208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7137","id":750694208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDY5NDIwOA==","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T01:19:56Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T01:40:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@zhiics @kevinthesun @yongwww \r\n\r\nGreat news!!

When I was investigating GPU NMS performance issue, the old code was taking 630 milliseconds while with this fix it was 2.1 seconds. But again, that's because the new code is dealing with far more boxes and our GPU NMS code is currently extremely slow due to the sequential loop.\r\n\r\nAccording to the numbers I posted in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7154, on CPU NMS is fast: the old code was spending only 8 milliseconds.

So the perf difference should only be in NMS.

We currently have 5 importers that leverage NMS:\r\n\r\nMXNET does multibox_transform_loc and then NMS on the outputs. multi_box_transform_loc converts a 3D array of scores with shape (batch_size, class_num, num_anchors) into a most likely class and score for that class, plus does some coordinate transforms on the box.\r\n\r\nONNX takes a 3D tensor of (batch_size, class, num_anchors), does slicing/concatenating with the boxes, and then does a per-class get_valid_counts->non_max.\r\n\r\nPytorch takes in a 1D tensor of scores and concats it with the boxes before performing get_valid_counts and nms. As @masahi shows in this PR, there is preprocessing to embed all classes into that 1D tensor outside of the op.\r\n\r\nTF takes a 1D tensor of scores and concats it to the boxes before performing get_valid_counts and nms. I'm not sure if the rest of the TF graph is handling the loop over batch size and classes.\r\n\r\nTFlite takes a 3D score tensor of shape (batch size, num_anchors, class_id), reorders it to (batch_size, class_id, num_anchors), performs multibox_transform_loc->nms, and strangely does get_valid_counts after NMS. \r\n\r\nIt looks like we're doing pre-processing in every framework to reduce the amount of score information and convert it to the 5 or 6 D form the nms API wants. None of the frameworks give us inputs in the packed form the API expects, and we jump through hoops in every importer to convert inputs into that form. Then in at least TFLite and ONNX, we perform further splitting/slicing/concatenating to restore the separate class ids. \r\n\r\nI think I agree with @masahi, we seem to be jumping through a lot of hoops in the importers to support a TVM NMS API that's out of line with the frameworks, and that might be hurting our overall performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750926391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750929667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7162#issuecomment-750929667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7162","id":750929667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDkyOTY2Nw==","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T17:13:26Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T17:13:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also cc @trevor-m who implemented TRT integration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750929667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750947058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7164#issuecomment-750947058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7164","id":750947058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDk0NzA1OA==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T19:06:12Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T19:06:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen re: the CI failure: svg is obviously not a binary type, but do we allow PNG?

As expected, there is almost no perf regression.\r\n\r\n``` \r\nOld code: 2.1364135856199997 sec\r\nAfter the fix in this PR: 2.1756499899999997 sec\r\n```\r\nThe old code spends 5 milliseconds on NMS. Here is the stat from profile.\r\nhttps://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/blob/master/maskrcnn/maskrcnn_cpu_vm_profile_old.txt#L51\r\n\r\nThe new code gets far more boxes, but NMS spends only 20 milliseconds on it.\r\nhttps://github.com/masahi/torchscript-to-tvm/blob/master/maskrcnn/maskrcnn_cpu_vm_profile_1000.txt#L24\r\n\r\nThe reason the new code doesn't make CPU perf worse is simple. Even though now NMS gets more boxes, PyTorch detection models does post NMS topk after RPN, see https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/90645ccd0e774ad76200245e32222a23d09f2312/torchvision/models/detection/rpn.py#L261-L263\r\n\r\nSo no matter how many boxes NMS gets, the number of boxes after NMS + post NMS topk doesn't change and bounded by `rpn_pre_nms_top_n_test` parameter whose default is 1000. The CPU perf is always dominated by the large dense layer.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I'd like to reiterate that the new code is more correct and gives essentially the same output as PyTorch. At this point, if you are still not happy with the this fix, I'm genuinely curious why.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750960526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/750998346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6964#issuecomment-750998346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6964","id":750998346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDk5ODM0Ng==","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T20:33:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T20:33:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sorry
