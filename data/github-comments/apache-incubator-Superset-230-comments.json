For Dashboard components, `filters` prop is the current filters state in redux. `extraFilters` has merged extra dashboard filter's value with chart's own formData params. It is not stored in redux state, but will be passed to backend as query parameter.\r\n\r\nFor FilterBox viz, `filters` prop is just original selected values:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/1dc17f357cf5c94f663f7a338a7814d5f79452e9/superset/assets/src/visualizations/FilterBox/transformProps.js#L51\r\nSo I prefer to re-name Chart component's `filters` props to be `origSelectedValues`.
