@tristaZero, @wgy8283335 \r\n\r\nWhile I was writing `ANTLR` definitions for `SELECT` statement's `selectList` and `fromClause`, I encountered an issue. \r\n\r\nAfter writing the definitions specified in this PR, I ran `mvn clean install` in the `shardingsphere-sql-parser-oracle` directory to auto-generate contexts but though the build succeeded, I had an error `Cannot resolve symbol 'OracleStatementParser'` in `OracleDMLStatementSQLVisitor`. \r\n\r\n![OracleDMLError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48581379/121642235-dd8b9f00-caad-11eb-95ae-e04e1fd3a256.png)\r\n \r\nBefore writing these definitions as mentioned in the Code of Conduct, I ran `mvn clean install`. There was no issue in the `OracleDMLStatementSQLVisitor`. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, I removed `selectFromClause` and its corresponding definitions and kept only `selectList` definition and its associated definitions such as `selectProjection` , `selectProjectionExprClause`  and ran `mvn clean install` and there were no errors. \r\n\r\n![OracleDMLNoError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48581379/121643002-ed57b300-caae-11eb-839c-4b4ddcd76ba6.png)\r\n\r\nI think the problem is with `selectFromClause` but I couldn't able to identify it. Even if we write definitions incorrectly, it should create the contexts, right? I should have created an issue for this but since it's coming because of my definition, I created a draft PR to show the code to you.
