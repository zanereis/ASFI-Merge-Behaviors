You can simply use a package.json file at the root of your project and then have it executed like this:\r\n\r\n            <plugin>\r\n                <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>\r\n                <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>\r\n                <version>1.8.0</version>\r\n                <executions>\r\n                    <execution>\r\n                        <id>npm install node and yarn</id>\r\n                        <phase>generate-resources</phase>\r\n                        <goals>\r\n                            <goal>install-node-and-yarn</goal>\r\n                        </goals>\r\n                        <configuration>\r\n                            <nodeVersion>v11.11.0</nodeVersion>\r\n                            <yarnVersion>v1.19.1</yarnVersion>\r\n                        </configuration>\r\n                    </execution>\r\n                    <execution>\r\n                        <id>yarn install</id>\r\n                        <phase>generate-resources</phase>\r\n                        <goals>\r\n                            <goal>yarn</goal>\r\n                        </goals>\r\n                    </execution>\r\n                    <execution>\r\n                        <id>yarn post-install</id>\r\n                        <phase>generate-resources</phase>\r\n                        <goals>\r\n                            <goal>yarn</goal>\r\n                        </goals>\r\n                        <configuration>\r\n                            <arguments>${yarn.arguments}</arguments>\r\n                        </configuration>\r\n                    </execution>\r\n                </executions>\r\n            </plugin>\r\n\r\nThis way you could use yarn add graphql-playground-react and set it up as needed. What do you think ? \r\n\r\nAlso did you see that GraphQL Playground and GraphiQL will be merging. It doesn't change anything right now but it might be something we want to stay on top of.
