There is still ambiguity if an ORDER BY item is a simple name that could match either an output column name or a column from the table expression. The output column is used in such cases. This would only cause confusion if you use AS to rename an output column to match some other table column's name.\n\nORDER BY can be applied to the result of a UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT combination, but in this case it is only permitted to sort by output column names or numbers, not by expressions.\n```\n\nThe second quote looks to give a description related to this issue.

The newly added test looks good, but have a limitation. That is, it cannot test that the qualifier is properly guessed for the simple column name in order-by clause. So, we need a test case to check the query execution result in addition to the plan test.\n\nIn addition, I found that this patch cannot handle the case when there are a column and an alias of same name. Please see the following example.\n\n_Postgresql_\n\n```\n# explain select r_name as n_name from nation, region order by n_name;\n                               QUERY PLAN                                \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Sort  (cost=284.00..293.25 rows=3700 width=32)\n   Sort Key: region.r_name\n   ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.00..64.71 rows=3700 width=32)\n         ->  Seq Scan on nation  (cost=0.00..17.40 rows=740 width=0)\n         ->  Materialize  (cost=0.00..1.07 rows=5 width=32)\n               ->  Seq Scan on region  (cost=0.00..1.05 rows=5 width=32)\n(6 rows)\n```\n\n_Tajo_\n\n```\ndefault> explain select r_name as n_name from nation, region order by n_name;\nERROR: Ambiguous column name: n_name\n```\n\nI think that this case also handled in this patch.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94567939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94568443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/452#issuecomment-94568443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/452","id":94568443,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0NTY4NDQz","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-20T21:08:11Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T21:08:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 LGTM!\nI'll commit shortly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94568443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/94582003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/543#issuecomment-94582003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/543","id":94582003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0NTgyMDAz","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-20T22:16:58Z","updated_at":"2015-04-20T22:16:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi, @jihoonson .

Users can define their own Python UDAFs by defining a class containing some mandatory functions, i.e., reset(), eval(), merge(), get_partial_result(), and get_final_result(). Here is a typical example.\n\n```\n  class AvgPy:\n    sum = 0\n    cnt = 0\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.reset()\n\n    def reset(self):\n        self.sum = 0\n        self.cnt = 0\n\n    # eval at the first stage\n    def eval(self, item):\n        self.sum += item\n        self.cnt += 1\n\n    # get intermediate result\n    def get_partial_result(self):\n        return [self.sum, self.cnt]\n\n    # merge intermediate results\n    def merge(self, list):\n        self.sum += list[0]\n        self.cnt += list[1]\n\n    # get final result\n    @output_type('float8')\n    def get_final_result(self):\n        return self.sum / float(self.cnt)\n```\n\nThe additional restriction is that the return type of `get_partial_result()` and the input type of `merge()` must be same.\n\nI'd like to give a brief explanation of how Python UDAFs are executed. During aggregation, Tajo currently keeps intermediate aggregation state per key in each implementation of aggregation operators. This approach also should be applied for Python functions to control resource usage and avoid a huge change. To do so, intermediate aggregation state of Python UDAF should be sent to Tajo workers whenever performing aggregation for different keys. However, I don't want for users to implement serialization/deserialization of intermediate aggregation state. \n\nSo, I simply used json for that. The snapshot of the instance of Python UDAF is sent to Tajo workers when necessary. \n\nLet me consider an example. When a tuple (1, 10) is read and the aggregation key is 1, Tajo creates a PythonAggFunctionContext for the aggregation key and call AvgPy.eval() with an input 10. Here, the intermediate aggregation state, i.e. AvgPy.sum = 10 and AvgPy.cnt = 1, is kept in the instance of AvgPy instead of PythonAggFunctionContext. However, when a tuple (2, 5) is read as a next input, Tajo gets intermediate aggregation state from the Python controller, and stores it in PythonAggFunctionContext. After that, the instance of AvgPy is reset to compute aggregation for another key 2.\n\nFollowings are some highlights of remaining implementation.\n- I've improved Python controller to support UDAF as well as UDF.\n  - For UDAF execution, the Python controller executes some pre-defined functions (reset(), eval(), merge(), get_partial_result(), and get_final_result()). \n- I've improved AggregationFunctionCallEval to support script functions via AggFunctionInvoke.\n  - AggFunctionInvoke is an abstract class to represent how the function is executed. There are two subclasses, ClassBasedAggFunctionInvoke and PythonAggFunctionInvoke.\n\nFinally, I've added several test functions, but some of them are disabled. This is due to our rigid function syntax. Currently, function names are explicitly defined in our parser, and their types are identified during parsing SQLs. This architecture should be improved to support functions defined by users.

@navis. Your patch looks good to me. I left only a single trivial comment.\nAdditionally, I have a question about `TupleType` even though this is not related to this patch. Obviously, `TupleType` represents the data type rather than tuple type (even I have no idea what tuple type means). I wonder why you don't use just `TajoDataTypes.Type`. \n\nFinally, truly sorry for late review, but would you rebase your patches? We have resolved the problem of jvm crash at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAJO-1568. If you trigger CI by rebasing your patches, it is definitely helpful for review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/96644896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/96653220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/548#issuecomment-96653220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/548","id":96653220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk2NjUzMjIw","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-27T13:32:55Z","updated_at":"2015-04-27T13:32:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1

job! The interface looks nice to me. Even though some parts seem to need more optimization, it would take more time. I think that the current patch seems to be ready to be committed because the interface and the code skeleton are great. We can do more optimization later.\n\nI have one comment. Could you rename isUdf to others like isScalarFunction or isAggregationFunction?

The test failure is due to the too much memory usage in python udfs. It's my fault. Sorry.\nThis problem will be solved if you rebase.\n\nI have one suggestion. Even though the annotation name is `SimpleTest`, it looks very proper for our all query tests. \nI think that we should test more complex and long queries. For such queries, it would be difficult to write sqls in the `SimpleTest` annotation. How about extending it to support sql files like the current query tests?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/97308878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/comments/97386990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tajo/pull/559#issuecomment-97386990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tajo/issues/559","id":97386990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3Mzg2OTkw","user":{"login":"jinossy","id":3632397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzIzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3632397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy","html_url":"https://github.com/jinossy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinossy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-29T10:51:23Z","updated_at":"2015-04-29T12:43:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I’ve
