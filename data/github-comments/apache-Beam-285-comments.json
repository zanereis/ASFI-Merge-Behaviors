there's a mismatch here.\r\n\r\nThe Pipeline will be marked as \"in a terminal state\" before it finishes tearing down all of the resources associated with it (`shutdownIfNecessary` - the update to the `pipelineState` precedes all cleanup work). As such, `waitUntilFinish` returns before calls to `teardown` or other cleanups complete.\r\n\r\nI'm not particularly concerned about that sequencing in either direction for resource management, given that we will always clean up the resources we have used if the process continues, or the process will be killed and we no longer care, combined with the fact that we make in general no guarantees about calling teardown on all instances of a DoFn.\r\n\r\nIf you want to ensure that `teardown` is called on all `DoFn` instances when a pipeline completes before it returns as `finished`, moving the `pipelineState.compareAndSet(State.RUNNING, newState);` line in `ExecutorServiceParallelExecutor` to happen last is where that change belongs (as it will catche all cleanup work, rather than a special case for DoFns). I'm ambivalent about the change (given that certainly some production systems will discard 'live' `DoFns` by terminating the process on which they exist, and it isn't safe to do work in `teardown` that is required for correct behavior).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/356434771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/356435194","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4332#issuecomment-356435194","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4332","id":356435194,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQzNTE5NA==","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-09T22:28:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T22:28:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Might

They confuse Jenkins anyhow.\r\n - Make a separate groovy file for example ITs (this adds value on its own, since unit tests will be more reliable).\r\n - In that file, use shell commands so you can do more than one (I think `mavenJob` only supports one lol) so you can do a \"no frills\" maven install of the examples and all runners, followed by independent calls to run ITs.
