@piiswrong.\r\nThe attached screenshot is training AlexNet in example/image-classification.\r\nAs you mentioned, the CPU2GPU copy has been achieved asynchronously as GPU/0 and GPU/1.\r\nHowever, when I train AlexNet with 8 K80, the speedup compared to 1 GPU is only 3.7x.\r\nThen, after profiling, I find loading data batch blocks the forward/backward operation like screenshot.\r\nHence, there is lots of idle time for GPUs.\r\nThe root cause is that the \"crop\" operations are only executed on a single **CPU** thread.\r\nHow do you think about running \"crop\" concurrently to improve the performance under multiple GPUs?\r\nI may try to do in my leisure time.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1085966/22727203/8902b1d4-ee12-11e6-9478-8396e1b75147.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/278251784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/278269587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4929#issuecomment-278269587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4929","id":278269587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODI2OTU4Nw==","user":{"login":"georg-at-github","id":25619338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE5MzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25619338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github","html_url":"https://github.com/georg-at-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georg-at-github/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T08:59:08Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T08:59:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I believe I found the solution: The issue is with the definition of the fit function.

As mentioned by @jli05, a single ndarray supporting both sparse and dense makes the interface clean, but it may confuse users. I'm prefer to give both (dense) NDArray and SparseNDArray to users so that they need to think about when should use sparse and when dense.\r\n\r\n2. Between row sparse and COO, I suggest to have CSR. It is good for input 2D sparse data and weights for LDA.  It is more compact than COO, and may lead to better performance.\r\n\r\nThere is straightforward way to extend to `kvstore`: uses the row ID as the key, and then partition the rows into server nodes. It is less flexible than use the index tuple as key, because need to communicate a whole row rather than individual element. But communicating rows may be better for performance and is good enough for most algorithms. For implementation, we only need to update the kvstore implementation without changing ps-lite. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/278449969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/278486298","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4911#issuecomment-278486298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4911","id":278486298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQ4NjI5OA==","user":{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T22:41:54Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T22:41:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"use the root logger as default (not sure it is a good idea) and add `basicConfig` in order to forward config","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/278486298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/278487688","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4911#issuecomment-278487688","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4911","id":278487688,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQ4NzY4OA==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T22:47:31Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T22:47:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you remove \r\n```\r\n+_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\r\n +_handler.setFormatter(_Formatter())\r\n +\r\n +# get the root logger\r\n +mxlogger = getLogger(name='', level=WARNING)\r\n +\r\n +def basicConfig(**kwarg):\r\n +    \"\"\"Forward to the logging.basicConfig\"\"\"\r\n +    mxlogger.handlers = []\r\n +    # This function does nothing if the root logger\r\n +    # already has handlers configured.\r\n +    logging.basicConfig(**kwarg)\r\n```\r\nSo it doesn't have any effect by default.

In this case, the model will run, but won't learn, so it's not a good idea! \r\n\r\nBottom line: arg.params, if provided, should simply be list containing the ndarrays for each of the model arguments (symbol$arguments, excluding data and label).
