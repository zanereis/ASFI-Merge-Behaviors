I hope we will fix the remaining blockers over the weekend and then we should have a pretty solid release with known issues but those can be worked with. \n\nIf you were on 1.6 and were happy with that for the time being then you could also use that for now. 1.7.0 really has some issues that I don't like.\n\nAre you on the dev list? If you can weigh in on the discussion on the scheduler and on what works for you from this PR that would be nice. As this PR touches the core of the scheduler there are some strong feelings about it :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/217456959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/217465876","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1431#issuecomment-217465876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1431","id":217465876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzQ2NTg3Ng==","user":{"login":"syvineckruyk","id":335167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTE2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/335167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk","html_url":"https://github.com/syvineckruyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syvineckruyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-06T14:58:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-06T14:58:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @bolkedebruin going back to 1.6.2 is not an option.
