If a task always gets large tuples, it can be slower than a task that gets small tuples without showing any reason why.  It would be good to track the byte counts as well so data skew can be observed directly.\r\n\r\nfrom the description I imagined that the issue would want to track the tuples in bytes for every tasks (maybe with sampling), but this patch only addresses tracking `transferred` tuples, which ignores local tasks.\r\n\r\nI can still see the benefit with measuring transferred tuples, but just like to check the patch fits origin intention for the issue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, currently we allow to put map to value in metric and let metrics collector handles it in any way. It should be changed, but we could resolve it along with other metrics later.\r\n\r\nThe code change itself looks good to me, and it would be much better if we could see the performance impact and confirm it's small enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/341267217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/341267839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2399#issuecomment-341267839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2399","id":341267839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTI2NzgzOQ==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T22:57:20Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T22:57:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And please change the title to 'STORM-2793 Track network data metrics' to conform to https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#create-a-pull-request\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/341267839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/341271276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2397#issuecomment-341271276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2397","id":341271276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTI3MTI3Ng==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-01T23:15:35Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T23:15:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like supporting 0.10.x in Storm 2.0.0 brings unnecessary pain.

The scores will be negative for your example.\r\n\r\n-0.1 for Topology 1 vs  -0.01 for Topology 2.  The smallest of these scores (-0.1) is the larger topology (Topology 1) so it would be prioritized first. \r\n\r\nThe algorithm is kind of odd.  It was designed with #2385 (Generic RAS) in mind.  Specifically GPU support.  There were 2 big goals here.  First we wanted something that we could apply in a simple way across all types of resources (No matter how many resources there were), and second we wanted to prioritize requests that needed a rare resource over requests that needed common resources.  We had a lesser goal of trying to be fair between users over their guarantees.\r\n\r\nWhy do we have these goals? We found a rather large problem with resource fragmentation in our clusters.  Up to 20% of the total resources end up not being usable because a single resource was effectively exhausted on a node before the other one could be.  GPUs are expensive and having one of them sitting idle because we filled the node up with other things is really hard to explain to a customer that needs the GPU.  If you look at #2385 you see that @govind-menon  has adjusted how nodes are selected for an executor.  Each time an executor is scheduled the nodes are sorted again.  The sorting of the nodes has also changed, even though that might be hard to see because of some of the refactoring.  It now tries to avoid nodes that have a \"rare\" resource on them unless the request needs that resource.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm tries to help by handing the other algorithm topologies that use rare resources first.  Rare in this case means it uses a higher percentage of what is in the cluster as a whole.  It is not perfect in this, because It has to take into account the user given priority of the topology first along with guaranteed resources.  So it ends up prioritizing larger topologies that fit within a users guarantee.  But once a user goes over their guarantee, it treats all users equally and will prioritize users that have less resources requested (hence smaller topologies likely show up ahead of bigger ones).  We may adjust this over time as we get more experience running with these kinds of topologies, and may end up evicting parts of a topology to make room for another topology that needs a fragmented resource.  But I would really like to avoid this if at all possible.\r\n\r\nNow to answer your second question about why I removed the eviction strategy.  On our staging clusters we have been running with a FIFO eviction strategy for the same reasons described in the FIFO prioritization strategy in this patch.  A few times we saw nimbus get stuck in what looked like an infinite loop trying to schedule topologies.  We were never able to come up with a reproducible use case but the way the APIs were written with each strategy returning a single item (the next one to schedule or evict) that you could imagine how they could feed off of each other and cause a loop to happen.  We \"fixed\" the issue internally by limiting the total number of times a topology will be scheduled before we give up on trying to schedule it.  But it is ugly and inefficient.  I kept it for this patch, but I am leaning towards removing it.  Instead if we have a single source of truth for a total ordering of topologies there is no way for it to be inconsistent.  We just try to schedule starting at the most important and evict starting at the least important.  This means there are no unbounded loops in the code, so there is no way to be stuck in one of those loops.  With that change we only needed one plugin to sort all of the topologies into a total order, so that is the new prioritization strategy API.  Hence no need for an eviction strategy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342211255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342218610","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1044#issuecomment-342218610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1044","id":342218610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjIxODYxMA==","user":{"login":"fescandell","id":6231110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzExMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6231110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell","html_url":"https://github.com/fescandell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fescandell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T17:14:03Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T17:14:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nIs there a similar solution like \"withPartitioner(new Partitioner()\" by using Trident : \r\n\r\n`HdfsState.HdfsFileOptions()`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342218610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342249555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2397#issuecomment-342249555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2397","id":342249555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjI0OTU1NQ==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T18:58:14Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T18:58:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR I agree that we might miss some things and maintaining that backwards compatibility long term is probably not ideal.

We have run some simulations that at least for our simulated load it does not appear to be any worse and in cases where there are GPU like resources it is a lot better. \r\n\r\nSolving fragmentation should mostly be around matching the ratio of resources in a request to the resources left on a node, which is a lot of what your initial RAS paper was about.  The problem is that when sorting the nodes we prioritize proximity to other parts of the same topology over fixing fragmentation.  So fragmentation really only matters when scheduling the first executor on a node.  Because of this I don't think it is the size of the topology that matters as much as it is the size of the individual components.  To really solve this we need a way to balance the desire to co-locate components with how well does this request fill what is left on the node.  I am hopeful that when we finish https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-2684 the scheduler will group parts of a topology that give it the biggest win within a single \"super component\" and then if we need to we can look at having a config that controls when to switch from sorting by co-locating to sorting to reduce fragmentation.  i.e. when do we move on to the next node in the rack even if this one is not full because we are starting to run low on resource X.\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions or want to collaborate on it that would be great, but you know how hard it is to for us to get legal approval to share too much more than just code. So for now we want to try and get this feature rolled out and then monitor it to see how it goes and if we need to adjust anything. \r\n\r\n@govind-menon,\r\n\r\nDo you have some of the simulation results in a human readable format we can share?  Also if you have the code we used to run the simulation putting an Apache license on it posting it would be great so that others can reproduce what we have done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342290628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342296249","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2400#issuecomment-342296249","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2400","id":342296249,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjI5NjI0OQ==","user":{"login":"jerrypeng","id":3613359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTMzNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3613359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng","html_url":"https://github.com/jerrypeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerrypeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-06T21:39:41Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T21:39:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 yup you are right about it being more about the size of the component.

Also some minor todos mentioned in code need to be addressed.\r\n- During scale testing, found that under certain multi-worker scenarios, noticed a inexplicable performance drop. The simplest way to reproduce the issue appears to be using a 2 workers setup with spouts and bolts distributed so that there is messaging occurring in both directions. Don't have a good grip on the issue yet.  Unfortunately last 3 weeks had to switch my attention to some other pressing release centric tasks at work.\r\n\r\nMay be useful to sync up with you offline soon and see if looking into the issue together helps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342323454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613042913","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6574#issuecomment-2613042913","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6574","id":2613042913,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTMwNDI5MTM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-07T16:39:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T17:26:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>I merged this into master</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613042913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/342551613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1044#issuecomment-342551613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1044","id":342551613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjU1MTYxMw==","user":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-07T17:05:53Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T17:05:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fescandell I don't believe there is.

I tried running the test outside a VM with a locally installed Storm setup, and it has failed every time for me. \r\n\r\nMost runs seem to fail in ways that make it look like the integration test is just flaky (e.g. tuple windows not matching the calculated window), but in at least a few tests I saw the topology get submitted to Nimbus followed by about 3 minutes of nothing happening. The workers never started and the supervisor didn't seem aware of the scheduling. The only evidence that the topology was submitted was in the Nimbus log. This still happens even if the test topologies are killed with a timeout of 0, so there should be slots free for the next test immediately.\r\n\r\nI tried reverting cef450064fa20e2194ef3f51a21c8e6693a285e3 and it seems to make the integration test pass much more often.

We set the auto offset reset policy to `earliest` by default when `AT_LEAST_ONCE` is picked if the user hasn't explicitly set anything else. \r\n\r\nThe misconfiguration I'm most worried about is where users set `AT_LEAST_ONCE`, and then forget to set the auto offset reset policy which defaults to `latest`, because it's an easy mistake to make if you're not already very familiar with Kafka's options. The other weird configurations (`AT_LEAST_ONCE`+`latest`, `AT_MOST_ONCE`+`earliest`) have to be explicitly chosen by the user.\r\n\r\nI can't think of a reason why users would want to use those configurations, but I thought it might be better not to prevent the user from using those settings if they really want to, because there might be a use case I'm not seeing.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to add in checks and error messages (or maybe even throwing exceptions) when using those configurations, if you think it makes sense?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/344025664/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/344036396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1505#issuecomment-344036396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1505","id":344036396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDAzNjM5Ng==","user":{"login":"priyank5485","id":5192436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTI0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5192436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485","html_url":"https://github.com/priyank5485","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/priyank5485/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-13T19:48:50Z","updated_at":"2017-11-13T19:48:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lichenglongqi You should not have to do anything.
