Gluon\r\n2. MXNet\r\n\r\nis like dividing a page on automobiles into \r\n\r\n1. Cars \r\n2. Automobiles. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense. That is what prompted the restructure. \r\n\r\nFollowing the reasons why it is restructured the way it is restructured now:\r\n\r\n1. NDArray is common to both the imperative and symbolic interface. It is also the most basic tutorials. So, that goes first. \r\n\r\n2. After learning to use NDArray, user can use Autograd to automatically compute gradients. Autograd is independent from Gluon and can be used without Gluon. So, Autograd is the next tutorial. \r\n\r\n3. Between Gluon and the symbolic interface, Gluon is the easier and more intuitive interface. So, gluon tutorials comes next.\r\n\r\n4. Symbolic interface naturally follows since Imperative (Gluon) and Symbolic are the two ways to write MXNet code. \r\n\r\n5. Hybrid blocks comes next because user needs to understand gluon and symbolic interface before user can understand Hybrid blocks. \r\n\r\n6. Sparse operations, large scale classifications and GAN are advanced topics and hence placed at the end.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what if any you would like to change and why.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/359543389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/359543422","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9455#issuecomment-359543422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9455","id":359543422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTU0MzQyMg==","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-22T19:49:09Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T19:49:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That's very strange.

Thanks for pointing this out. I do need to remove the header from the file you mentioned. \r\n\r\nWhy a separate license file for dockerfiles - \r\nThe current pipeline for creating docker images combines the content of two dockerfiles on the fly and generates a new one (for example python + gpu). The automated pipeline does not take the license headers into consideration at the moment and this needs to be tested and fixed. I am currently in the process of fixing the docker pipeline and this issue might be resolved differently in the future. However, The license.md file is the only solution at the moment \r\n\r\nWhy the scala file has a license header\r\nThe scala dockerfile that you pointed out got a license header at some point because it ends in `*.scala` to which the license_header.py script added a license. \r\nThis led to the docker pipeline failing. That is how I realized the dockerfiles are currently not ready for a license header. I have updated this PR. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/359589232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/359589536","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/9519#issuecomment-359589536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9519","id":359589536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTU4OTUzNg==","user":{"login":"madjam","id":8388825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzODg4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8388825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam","html_url":"https://github.com/madjam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madjam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-22T22:18:41Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T22:18:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This change is a improvement over what we have today.

The reason is that perplexity is usually just the exp(cross_entropy_loss). Since cross_entropy_loss is required for training and often used in testing, getting perplexity is just about calculating its exponential. Having a separate perplexity in that case could mean unnecessarily repeated computation.\r\n\r\nOur separation of metric and loss was an artifact of past design choices. Given that gluon.loss already covers many metrics, I'm not sure how much value it would add to have a separate metric package. The only case that can be useful is for the metrics with non-differentiable calculation, such as those involving argmax and topk (acc, P, R, F1, etc.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/359669294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/359670723","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/9438#issuecomment-359670723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9438","id":359670723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTY3MDcyMw==","user":{"login":"kice","id":3945950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDU5NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3945950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice","html_url":"https://github.com/kice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kice/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-23T04:09:41Z","updated_at":"2018-01-23T04:09:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I did not see any error on Windows when mxnet crashes.
