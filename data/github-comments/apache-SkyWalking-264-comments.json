The main obstacle in your branch I see is being 36 commits behind our upstream master, where among the commits, our contributors have changed quite a lot of structures, especially coding guidelines. \r\n\r\nPlease do let us know when you got time to resume the work :) so that we can work together to sort out the complexities in merging the master branch into your own. \r\n\r\nBtw it looks like we are in the same timezone, I certainly feel for you because I'm also under heavy course & lab work daily. For me it is quite relieving to switch around and do something fun and recognized in the open-source community when I get way too much stress in schoolwork, I guess that's an important reason why I keep coming back.

contains a collection of metrics from a Resource. This is a suitable unit for converting metricList to meter system processing. Now skywalking otel-receiver-plugin also does the same. But now the meter service is a metricList in a stream.\r\n```Java\r\n    @Override\r\n    public StreamObserver<MeterData> collect(StreamObserver<Commands> responseObserver) {\r\n        final MeterProcessor processor = processService.createProcessor();\r\n        return new StreamObserver<MeterData>() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onNext(MeterData meterData) {\r\n                try (HistogramMetrics.Timer ignored = histogram.createTimer()) {\r\n                    processor.read(meterData);\r\n                } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                    errorCounter.inc();\r\n                    log.error(e.getMessage(), e);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onError(Throwable throwable) {\r\n                processor.process();\r\n                log.error(throwable.getMessage(), throwable);\r\n                responseObserver.onCompleted();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onCompleted() {\r\n                processor.process();\r\n                responseObserver.onNext(Commands.newBuilder().build());\r\n                responseObserver.onCompleted();\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If we want to transmit another metricList, we must open another stream. My opinion is to add a service like\r\n```\r\n rpc collect (stream MeterDataList) returns (Commands) {\r\n     },\r\n```\r\n so we can use one stream to transmit multiple MeterDataList.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/965998972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/966001232","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/6210#issuecomment-966001232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/6210","id":966001232,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArmls845lAJQ","user":{"login":"liqiangz","id":16935891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTM1ODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16935891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz","html_url":"https://github.com/liqiangz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liqiangz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-11T05:26:37Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T05:29:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another solution is to implement format conversion in skywalking like otel-receiver-plugin, so that using the otlp protocol for transmission, there is no need for a metriclist in a stream.
