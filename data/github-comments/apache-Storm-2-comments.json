@xumingming \nThanks for taking a look at this, I appreciate it.\n\nIt looks like the dependency on the shaded libthrift jar is the issue.\n\nI'll take a deeper look, and fire up some VMs to test in a clean environment.\n\nOut of curiosity, if you run the following, what happens (from the source root):\n\n```\ncd storm-deps/libthrift\nmvm clean install\ncd ../../\nmvm clean install\n```\n\nThanks again,\n\nTaylor\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31907926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612435154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/3937#issuecomment-2612435154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3937","id":2612435154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0MzUxNTQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-09T15:19:42Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:37:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

rel=\"ptgoetz\">P. Taylor Goetz</a> We at Yahoo have done a lot of work on securing storm and are currently running with it in production. This includes some work towards this JIRA. We have our own single sign on that we support through an http filter.  I have been looking for a good way for us to get back in sync with the community, if this is a high priority for you, I would be happy to take some of my weekend and upmerge all that we have done to the latest apache.  My biggest concern is that it is a lot of code.  I am fine if you want to try and review it all in one monster session, but I think I would prefer it if we could file a rollup JIRA for security and we can pull our changes onto a branch, and then file smaller JIRA to pull back different parts of it to master as they are reviewed.  That way people can see and start using security now, but with the stipulation that things might change.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612433343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/31963429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/14#issuecomment-31963429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/14","id":31963429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTYzNDI5","user":{"login":"anfeng","id":2708344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDgzNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2708344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/anfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-09T18:49:34Z","updated_at":"2014-01-09T18:49:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ptgoetz I continue to see those 3 errors. mvn log indicates various topology configuration issues:\n\n...................\n\n31789 [main] WARN  backtype.storm.daemon.nimbus - Topology submission exception.

Essentially in the code that parsed the command line options it looked to see if the value looked like a number, and if it did, it converted it to a number and stored it in the config.  There was also some code for lists and things too.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4015#issuecomment-2612444516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4015","id":2612444516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NDQ1MTY=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-05T19:17:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:43:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jethrobakker\">jethrobakker</a>:</i>\n<p>Robert, check the first comment of <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-72\" title=\"Storm Conf convert value to int fail\" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-72\"><del>STORM-72</del></a> it contains a simple check for numbers.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612444516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
