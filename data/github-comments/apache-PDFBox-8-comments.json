Unless you think that the error handling is poor, then it should be changed everywhere. The reason I ask this is because your read() has a different behavior than other read() methods, and because I'd like to keep the code as small as possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/comments/2188861564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/comments/2189054847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/pull/189#issuecomment-2189054847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/189","id":2189054847,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAATal86CelN_","user":{"login":"bogdiuk","id":24727991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzI3OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24727991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bogdiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bogdiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-25T14:05:40Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T16:03:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you, I will fix the issues today.\r\n\r\nRe `readExact()`/`readUpTo()`: I will remove them for simplicity, they remained from my initial PR.\r\n\r\nI initially saw that `RandomAccessRead.read()` was called in a loop and assumed that it behaves like `InputStream.read()` (i.e. can return `<N` bytes and still have more coming), so it needs to be wrapped into `readUpTo()`.\r\nBut now I see that all implementations of `RandomAccessRead.read()` have loops of their own, so they already behave like `InputStream.readNBytes()` (can only read less than N bytes in case of EOF)?
