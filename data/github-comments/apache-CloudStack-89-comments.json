I personally do not like to use final declarations, I use them only if needed; they tend to make extensions harder (sometimes).\n\nThe following comments are about “SecurityGroupRulesCmd” class:\nAt lines 73, 129, 140 and maybe others, why not initialize the ArrayList when you declare the attribute, this way it is always ready for use. I personally like to work this way, initializing List, Maps and others at the moment of variable declaration.\n\nI would also suggest improving the java doc at method “stringifyRulesFor” to make it clear of its purpose and how it works.\n\nThe comment of method “compressCidr” should be converted to proper java doc style. I would also use the \"/\" magical character as a constant.\nAt line 206, I would suggest you extracting the code to a method and changing the contracted “IF” to a normal if structure, improving readability.\n\nI also recommend changing the comment of “compressStringifiedRules” method to proper java doc style. If you do that, please extract the comment at lines 221 and 222 to the java doc.\n\nI recommend you removing the comment of line 251. If there is something to be said about that method, that should be done at the Java doc.\n\nThe following comments are about “SecurityGroupRulesCmdTest” class.\nAt the test if the “setUpBeforeClass” is not used, I suggest removing it. I think the best philosophy is to add code only when needed.\n\nWhy does the class “SecurityGroupHttpClient” is being marked as completely changed? It seems that nothing has been changed there. Just some small adjusts at line 75 and 76\n\nI believe that is all. There are other suggestions to add some more Java doc and tests, but let's keep them to another PR in the near future.\n\n@cristofolini , @GabrielBrascher and @pedro-martins could you also help here?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172196150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172197923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1289#issuecomment-172197923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1289","id":172197923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjE5NzkyMw==","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-16T12:24:30Z","updated_at":"2016-01-16T12:24:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ping @agneya2001 let's get this resolved soon :-) All those build failure mails hurt my eyes..\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172197923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172203787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1060#issuecomment-172203787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1060","id":172203787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjIwMzc4Nw==","user":{"login":"jburwell","id":285646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/285646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell","html_url":"https://github.com/jburwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-16T12:59:27Z","updated_at":"2016-01-16T12:59:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@DaanHoogland I lost track of the mailing list thread until this PR.

Actually, in most PRs I review the code normally is ok, I just point out some aspects that can be improved.\n\nI understand your point on using the final modifier. Since ACS is not a framework, I can agree with you here. I will start using them from now on.\n\nWe only diverge at the point regarding Java docs, and that is fine. I know that are some other development philosophies that do not like to use documentation, I understand their point. I also noticed that some people here do not like to use much Java doc and sometimes they confuse java doc with block comment.\n\nI believe that all of Apache libraries/software I know are heavily documented, in a page that presents the use of the library/software and at the code. That is one of the reasons why I love apache Java libraries/software, because of their documentation, from which I can understand and use the software without needing to rely on someone else. IMO ACS should have more documentation on its code for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it gives a purpose to the method or class. It forces people to think on what they will code into a method and stick to what was planned, instead of planning and creating code on the fly which in some cases lead to big chunks that are hard to maintain and refactor.\n\nSecond, Java docs facilitate to new developers to really understand the behavior and purpose of classes and methods. That also helps when developing new code; with proper documentation, I find it easier to uncover the right place to place a new method/function.\n\nAbout documentation on private methods, I use them (write them sometimes). I also have used them (read) and find them quite useful in some components I use. Apache libraries such as Apache Commons use them. I understand that there are self-explanatory methods which do not need documentation. However, given the complexity of ACS, I believe that proper java doc would facilitate to new devs. I am not saying that we should start documenting everything. When I suggest the addition of a Java doc or a test case, it is merely a tentative to improve our code base. I see the process of creating Java docs the same as writing test cases, it takes time and a change in the mindset to get used to them. \n\nYour code as always is great, I would just suggest some more improvement at the new method you created that is called “represent”, I believe the best name for the boolean variable should be something like, “shouldCompress” or” hasToCompress”. The name of the method does not sound descriptive to me, but if you guys are ok with it, I am too.\n\nGiving all of that, it is a LGTM from me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172347935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172353941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1287#issuecomment-172353941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1287","id":172353941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjM1Mzk0MQ==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-17T17:09:38Z","updated_at":"2016-01-17T17:09:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @rafaelweingartner. as for your last remark \n\n```\nYour code as always is great, I would just suggest some more improvement at the new method you created that is called “represent”, I believe the best name for the boolean variable should be something like, “shouldCompress” or” hasToCompress”.

On MS shutdown/restart the incomplete job entry will always get marked as cancelled in DB.\nYou are right that an async job might continue to run even after MS shutdown. For e.g. MS is stopped in middle of deploy VM operation. If the command to deploy VM has reached HV before MS stop, then it will get started. The DB will be synced to correct state based on vm sync once the MS is started again.\nFor volume and other operations (snapshot etc.), there is no recovery in these scenarios. Something like storage sync needs to be implemented which can update DB state based on the actual content/state of primary and secondary storages.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172421544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/172449988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1336#issuecomment-172449988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1336","id":172449988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjQ0OTk4OA==","user":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T07:30:00Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T07:43:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"all
