They run similar to Selenium, but due to the way Cypress works, tests are less brittle.\r\n\r\nRunning the e2e tests will download some large dev dependencies, and video recording is disabled by default to reduce disk space, but that can be enabled to record the tests if needed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn run coverage:e2e\r\nyarn run test:e2e\r\nyarn run test:e2e -- --headless --browser chrome\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are examples of how to run it. Without the `--headless`, Cypress will display a dialogue to choose the browser to run the tests with. You can go back in time and review what the UI looked like for each step of the test, which is quite handy when reproducing tests or user issues.\r\n\r\nI've implemented a small JS mock server to store datasets and return some dummy data for the UI. This way we don't need to start a Docker container or something like that every time we run the tests (I found out that that helps speeding up the UI development, especially if a contributor is not familiar how to run the Jena backend.)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-07-20 13-26-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304786/179879089-282fc6a4-5925-40ec-b51e-9a0d8003e837.png)\r\n\r\nTest coverage is also quite good now with the e2e tests - the report below shows just the e2e tests coverage, but what's important is that it's covering the new code that I had to write to move away from Bootstrap Vue, and also that we can use these tests to write most of the new tests if needed (i.e. easy to copy-and-paste to create new tests).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-07-20 13-57-08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304786/179879242-60ff911a-0a1a-4f12-bac8-86109109e04e.png)\r\n\r\nReady for review @afs, whew. After this one gets merged, my next task will be to upgrade all dependencies to the latest, and start moving things from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

One being a JavaScript error (thanks for catching that up!), and another left-over from the Bootstrap Vue migration :open_mouth: I've removed it, fixed the JS error, and wrote an e2e test to try to prevent it from happening again :+1: \r\n\r\n@afs in case you haven't seen the e2e tests yet, here's what it looks like when I re-run the e2e test for the Edit function. The HTTP calls are mocks that I copied/adapted from a running Fuseki instance. It creates 11 datasets (for testing pagination), and selects the first `a` dataset, then lists the current graphs, and clicks on the graph name. Finally, it confirms the code editor contains some expected text.\r\n\r\n![GIFrecord_2022-08-02_221041](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304786/182351024-3629fa99-fddd-4f0d-9be3-12bb5ecbcb57.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter the test has completed, you can \"go back\" in time. It keeps \"frames\" of the UI (hidden elements in the DOM). As you scroll back in the test timeline, it shows the past of the execution, allowing you to see what was clicked, what was displayed, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this will help us move with the UI without adding regressions in every release (No promises! JS is a really permissive language, and there are so many libs involved, even though we are trying to be minimalistic... but that's the theory :laughing: )\r\n\r\nReady for review again!

We have ASF Jenkins all setup to trigger and these jobs don't get inherited. For a java project, running one on-push job and a few regular (e.g. weekly) jobs is more than enough.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point.\r\n\r\nI think we can also control it. For example, the project I worked today only builds for code pushed to the `main` branch, or to pull requests created against the `main` branch: https://github.com/kinow/cwlviewer/blob/f1091b4ad96236be4eb78df8451e27a81fdb972a/.github/workflows/ci-build.yml#L3-L9\r\n\r\nMy fork has not run any GH Actions, even though I created several PR's against the main repository: https://github.com/kinow/cwlviewer/actions/\r\n\r\nBecause I never created a PR on my fork to the main branch of my repository. I haven't tried it but I believe if I did that, it would trigger a PR on my fork - which I agree would be a waste of time & resources.\r\n\r\nThe main repository contains the Actions triggered `on: pull_request`: https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/pull/426/checks\r\n\r\nAnd since it was a `pull_request` event, it's checking the merge commit (IIUC what the code will look like after it's merged): https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/15#issuecomment-524093065 (that can be controlled too)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304786/184609694-3e6584f3-6d7d-43e6-b4aa-144c24720056.png)\r\n\r\nI have seen the Jenkins jobs in the ASF Jenkins, but I will confess that I rarely verify the status there.

Either may have been intended.\r\n\r\nThe assembler design implicitly assumes use-once assemblers (but that is a contradiction to the registry) and use on a single thread.\r\n\r\n* There needs to be a scope object passed around. \r\n* The needs to be a better policy for same vs fresh.\r\n\r\nThe assembler subsystem needs replacing, new API and simplified.

It should on graph/node not Resource.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that building services in Fuseki is located in one area of code and also that the core of build-dispatch isn't that large.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: design first!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1216248026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/comments/1216407774","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1476#issuecomment-1216407774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1476","id":1216407774,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHF7Ec5IgOje","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-16T09:45:01Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T10:04:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Probably (it needs detailed analysis) the build policy should be \"same URI, same thing\" per build run which an individual builder can ignore.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the assembler is very similar to that of spring bean definitions which support different scopes:\r\nhttps://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html\r\n\r\nThe most relevant ones are:\r\nScope | Description\r\n-- | --\r\nsingleton | Scopes a single bean definition to a single object instance per Spring IoC container.\r\nprototype | Scopes a single bean definition to any number of object instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn java this is done with\r\n```java\r\nclass MyBeanDefinitions {\r\n  @Bean\r\n  @Scope(\"prototype\")\r\n  MyBean myBean() { ... }\r\n\r\n  // When Spring IoC proceeds to create the dependent beans, it takes\r\n  // care of calling the following bean creation functions each with a fresh instance\r\n  // of MyBean because of its prototype scope annotation:\r\n  @Bean\r\n  MyDependentBean myDependentBean1(MyBean myBean) { ... } \r\n\r\n  @Bean\r\n  MyDependentBean myDependentBean2(MyBean myBean) { ... } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps these annotations could be simply expressed in the RDF using a `ja:scope` attribute?\r\nE.g.\r\n```ttl\r\n  <#myMemoryDatasetBean> a ja:MemoryDataset ;\r\n   ja:scope ja:prototype ; # Each reference to <#myMemoryDatasetBean> would create a new Java object\r\n   .\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe limitation above might be that it could be difficult to reference a specific instance.
