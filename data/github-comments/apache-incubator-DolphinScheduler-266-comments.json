While deploying the DS cluster, a zookeeper cluster should also be deployed. It is also necessary to monitor the operation and maintenance of the DS cluster and the zookeeper cluster at the same time\r\n1. Increase the chance of error. The network between the DS cluster and the zookeeper cluster is fluttering, and errors may occur.\r\n\r\n## remove zookeeper's point\r\n1. The deployment architecture is simpler\r\n2. Lower maintenance cost\r\n3. No more DS errors due to zookeeper cluster errors\r\n\r\n## remove zookeeper scheme\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13765310/178137541-39521953-39f9-40ff-9008-df983e66d1b8.png\">\r\n\r\n1.

The raft algorithm requires more than half of the nodes to survive to keep the cluster running. 3 masters have a maximum of 1 down, 5 master nodes have a maximum of 2 downs, and so on.\r\n1. If less than half of the masters survive, all remaining masters commit suicide\r\n2. If the leader master dies, the leader will be re-selected among the remaining followers, and the time for re-election will be controlled within a few hundred milliseconds.\r\n## Monitoring and information storage\r\n1. Workers and follower send the heartbeat information originally written to zookeeper (HeartBeat.class) to the leader node via Netty, which is kept in memory by the leader node\r\n1. The follower cycle takes master and worker information from the leader, saves it in memory, and serves as a hot spare for the leader\r\n1. Api Server obtains monitoring information for masters and workers from any master node\r\n1. If the leader does not receive heartbeat information from the worker and follower for more than a certain period of time, they will be moved to the dead list for fault tolerance\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1179764040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1179769199","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/pull/10869#issuecomment-1179769199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10869","id":1179769199,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5GUdlv","user":{"login":"zhuxt2015","id":13765310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzY1MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13765310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuxt2015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuxt2015/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-10T17:36:49Z","updated_at":"2022-07-10T17:36:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I think we should better add `;\\n` as the default value, and users can overwrite it in our web ui. it makes our SQL task more general and does not break the previous behavior.
