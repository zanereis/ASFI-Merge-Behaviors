sorry about the delay with this. It took me some time to wrap my head around the StandardStructureTestSuit and adding my crappy testing env to that suddenly made things way more complicated.\n\nAnyways I've tested this with : \n\n```\nmvn clean install -DincludeNeo4j\n```\n\nAnd I've also run related integration tests (though not all as my poor ubuntu VM wouldn't manage.. I'm going to fix the builds on my mac this weekend to have a clean dev environment and avoid this in the future)\n\nI haven't managed to run the tests against titan though (for the threaded transactions) If someone could give those a look it would perfect.
