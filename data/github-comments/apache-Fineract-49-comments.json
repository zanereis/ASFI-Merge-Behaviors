Here's the reason why: upon a fork PR's GH Action, the action doesn't have access to the repo's configured secrets and this is mentioned in the GH docs:\r\n```\r\nNote: With the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository.\r\n```\r\nMeaning that the Sonarqube related secrets (including the token as well) are inaccessible unless the forkee's repo has the same set of secrets.\r\n\r\nI limited the sonarqube action to run after a PR merge and only on the develop branch for now.\r\n\r\nA proper solution would be to go back to Travis (or to any other external system where the secrets are not managed by GH) and run the sonar scan there but we gotta be careful not running into the same walls as originally; like with Travis, build slowness with the free pricing plan.

@galovics  Apologies for the late.\r\n@galovics, Comments have been addressed and now the properties of countries are getting loaded while booting.\r\nI have done a small twist I have removed the country code from database and providing the country code and country name to user from properties file itself.\r\nSo it goes like this: \r\n1. when the user fetches the country list from code value API, it provides countries list (along with country code) from properties file (getCountriesList() function- loaded in startup)\r\n2. when the user selects country and saves in the identifier, country-code gets saved. and when the user fetches this identifier, the country-code gets translated to country name. (translateCountryList() function - loaded in startup)\r\nSo only country which is saved in identifier is getting translated instead of translating whole country list (which would have been required in step (1) but now its not,  and loading the properties file and the translation at startup time.\r\nLet me know, if it is ok with this way.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1124365672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/1124666497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/2314#issuecomment-1124666497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/2314","id":1124666497,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAuLPJ85DCQyB","user":{"login":"galovics","id":4701389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDEzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4701389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics","html_url":"https://github.com/galovics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/galovics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-12T08:09:48Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T08:09:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The

Re \"amount of PR renovate raised was too much to handle\" - how was this assessed? We had the previous set-up running for 2 years and I don't think it was a major issue at any point. At least I don't recall any discussion about this on the mailing list. But perhaps I missed it?\r\n\r\nPreviously we had regular merges of minor dependencies every week. Now we have had no merges of dependencies since May.
