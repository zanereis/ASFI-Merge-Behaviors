这个不是会不会出现BufferUnderflowException的问题。是消息偏移的获取问题。如果第1条消息的offset是1，那么第5条消息的offset是5，而不应当是4。\r\n当然了，如果按我们编程习惯来说，索引应当是0开始。但不能套用到这里的offset上，因为如果第1条消息的offset是1的话，那第0条消息的offset就0了。\r\n这个地方计算的问题，连带了很多的副作用了。比如根据时间戳重置消息偏移的时候，重置到当前时间的时候 ，重置的永远是当前最大偏移-1，而其它时间点都是正常的。同样在代码实现上根据2分查找获取偏移值的时候，除了最后一条消息，获取方式都是离时间戳最近的那个，结果预期，但是时间 大于等于当前时间的时候，就只能获取到倒数第2条。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/782006904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/782007310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2661#issuecomment-782007310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2661","id":782007310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjAwNzMxMA==","user":{"login":"xxd763795151","id":19887530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODg3NTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19887530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151","html_url":"https://github.com/xxd763795151","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T11:10:03Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T11:10:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"如果第1条消息offset是0，那第0条消息呢。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/782007310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/782036557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2656#issuecomment-782036557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2656","id":782036557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjAzNjU1Nw==","user":{"login":"xxd763795151","id":19887530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODg3NTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19887530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151","html_url":"https://github.com/xxd763795151","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T12:10:36Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T12:10:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">

是的，我之前尝试提交个pr，修复这个问题，但是感觉风险太大，最终没有提交本地代码，也把这个pr关了。\r\n当时的思路是这样的，在最后返回的时候加上一个CQ_STORE_UNIT_SIZE，保证每次返回的时候，当前查到的消息的偏移上加上一。因为如果没有消息的话，直接就返回0了，不会走到这一步。如果走到这个地方，就会返回我们平常说的消息位点的这个实际值。\r\n```\r\nreturn (mappedFile.getFileFromOffset() + offset + CQ_STORE_UNIT_SIZE) / CQ_STORE_UNIT_SIZE;\r\n```\r\n然后将几处涉及到根据这个偏移来获取物理position的地方进行修改，就是将查询的offset再减1。改完之后，我发现，改动的地方有点多，我根本无法确认所有修改的地方都没有问题，也没时间进行测试，风险太高，就没提交最终代码，并把pr也关了。\r\n也无法猜测最初作者是怎么思考的，这个地方计算的offset的为什么不是实际消息的位点，所以就把这个issue留了下来。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/782049365/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/782052342","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2674#issuecomment-782052342","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2674","id":782052342,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MjA1MjM0Mg==","user":{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T12:44:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T12:44:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"看上去是
