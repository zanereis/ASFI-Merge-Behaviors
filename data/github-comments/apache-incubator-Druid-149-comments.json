proposal, I think the following things should be considered closely:\r\n* Rolling restart capability. For example Mesosphere Marathon allows to keep a percentage of the cluster up while doing an upgrade/reconfiguration/maintenance restart of the cluster. That is very important for Historical clusters.\r\n* Readiness check period. When you do a rollout and need to keep a part of the cluster up, you need some status, so to decide is a new node is ready and healthy, so you can proceed with rest of the cluster. For example Historical needs some time to read cache from disk storage, this period should not be considered neither healthy nor unhealthy. If we take that period as healthy we will restart all the cluster at once (could be a huge strain for the coordinator, and could cause general unavailability of the service). If we take (cache loading period) as unhealthy then (cache loading is long enough) the task will fail the health check and will be restarted during cache loading. So health checks should trigger a restart due to a node failure, and readiness checks delay a rollout until new nodes can serve loaded segments.\r\n* I think, even if you aren't going to implement multiple running  druid containers on a single node, you have to plan the architecture for that from the start, so at the time when you start to implement you don't have to rewrite most of your previous solutions. How do you plan to provide ports/paths parameters in that case, for example?\r\n* I think, thread pool sizes should be derived from allocated vcores number dynamically.\r\n* What the capabilities of the tracking UI do you plan?\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know whether your MiddleManager cluster is using Indexer auto-scaling feature. If yes, then why do you need Yarn for MiddleManager?\r\nDo you plan to implement any kind of resource isolation?\r\nDid you consider Mesos?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/311118059/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/311137295","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4467#issuecomment-311137295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4467","id":311137295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTEzNzI5NQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-26T18:08:22Z","updated_at":"2017-06-26T18:08:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Marked

So currently I'd like to implement druid on yarn first.\r\n\r\n* The app master can support several different startup strategies:\r\n  1. exclusive -- one container on a single node \r\n  2. common -- container can be started on any node with enough resource\r\n\r\n  And more strategies could also be added dynamicly with limited code change.\r\n\r\n  The second strategy depends on a critical feature: configuration needs to be replaced on worker startup by app master.  \r\n\r\n  For example: the **historical data dir** and the **thread pool sizes**.  With multitenancy in to consideration, even the zk path need to be set by app master.\r\n\r\n  The design for this config-replace feature is to separate the binary build and config.  The configuration will be replaced and merged into binary build before worker startup by app master.\r\n\r\n* Resource isolation\r\nAs far as I know, yarn has resource isolation function using cgroup.  \r\n\r\n* MiddleManager\r\nFor now,  middle manager is considered as controller role.  So it won't be scheduled by yarn.\r\n\r\n*  Rolling restart \r\nRolling restart is a great proposal. \r\n   1. In my design, one app master is designated for one role.  So sysadmins needs to decide which role to upgrade.\r\n   2. Upgrade broker/historical. \r\n\r\n   Currently, the strategy is rather simple.  Split workers into several batches and upgrade these batches one by one with a time interval of n.  The batch size and time interval will be decided by sysadmins according to their experience.\r\n   \r\n   I can't find any good way to check the status for brokers and historical.  For my understanding,  currently, there's no interface to get the worker status.  \r\n\r\n* Tracking UI\r\nWell i haven't thought about it thoroughly yet as the yarn UI is enough for me now.  So I would be really appreciate if you have any ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/311240437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/311277068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4238#issuecomment-311277068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4238","id":311277068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTI3NzA2OA==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T07:31:48Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T07:31:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm thanks.

thanks for your review! About your top level comments:\r\n\r\n> I tested a simple query like select sum(cast(l_linenumber, integer)) from druid.lineitem but the result was 0 even though select cast(l_linenumber, integer) from druid.lineitem returned a valid result. l_linenumber is defined as a string dimension. What is more weird is that I cannot reproduce this in unit tests. Do you have any idea?\r\n\r\nGood catch… I'll add a test case for this. My guess is it's because the SQL layer has some code to detect when a cast is \"unnecessary\" to pass down to Druid, since it will be coerced at runtime anyway. In that case the Druid query uses a direct field access, which is often faster. I believe this is actually not ok when casting string to number for an aggregator, and that's where the problem comes from.\r\n\r\n> All works around this patch is to use Druid's expression as an internal projection layer for sql. I guess this is to avoid adding huge amount of codes to cover SQL's flexible expressiveness. However, this means, sometimes a sql query is parsed into Calcite's AST, and then some parts of the AST are converted to druid expression strings again. This will cause additional parsing overhead, and if the query size is exceptionally large like a few KB to MB, this can be significant. There will be some applications which uses large queries if we support join. What do you think about this?\r\n\r\nI think it's probably ok, since if a query is very large due to lots of joins, then I bet none of that will make it into Druid expressions anyway. If it's very large due to lots of complex expressions, then yes that will have to be parsed twice, but it should be dwarfed by execution overhead. (complex expressions are probably not cheap to execute at runtime)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312384389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312398539","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4461#issuecomment-312398539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4461","id":312398539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjM5ODUzOQ==","user":{"login":"akashdw","id":5886276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODYyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5886276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw","html_url":"https://github.com/akashdw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akashdw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-01T00:25:04Z","updated_at":"2017-07-01T00:25:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @jihoonson. addressed comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312398539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/312409584","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4126#issuecomment-312409584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4126","id":312409584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjQwOTU4NA==","user":{"login":"erikdubbelboer","id":522870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjg3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer","html_url":"https://github.com/erikdubbelboer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-01T04:25:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-01T04:25:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm next week I'll upgrade our cluster to `0.10.1-rc1`.

The coordinator internally runs [mergeTasks](http://druid.io/docs/latest/ingestion/tasks.html#segment-merging-tasks) not native index tasks, which have the limitation that works for only noneShard specs. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the currently possible solution based on druid's native index task is to manually set up a compaction workflow using some workflow tools like oozie. For example, you can schedule your compaction task to be run every midnight for merging segments ingested for a day. \r\n\r\nFYI, there are two proposals for automatic background compaction (#4479) and improved segment generation in kafka indexing tasks (#4178).
