(assume the first column is submission time). \r\n\r\nTo reduce the listing cost, Hudi does have a [metadata table ](http://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations#hoodiemetadataenable) that can fetch listings without going to cloud storage for listings. We can try this out. I think even with file index, listing is fetched/refreshed at-least once.  \r\n\r\nwhen writing,querying the dataset, use  `hoodie.metadata.enable=true`\r\n\r\nbut the bigger cost is the 1 minute between 0 and 1.
