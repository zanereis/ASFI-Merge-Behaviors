Which means we need to know type of compression when creating a kvstore. In the 2bit PR, since we still use float32 to represent values (for 2bit compression, 16 values represented in one float32), the original server was sent a message to know the type of compression.\r\n\r\nThe only way I see to merge interfaces is to have compression parameters even in my case to come in at the time of creating kvstore. To start this, I would like to understand how to give the argument defined in python/mxnet/kvstore_server.py to start the server.\r\n\r\nGeneral n-bit compression can be done. But neither this PR nor my PR can be directly extended as of now. In my PR, although the framework in kvstores can be generalized easily, the operator is 2bit specific. Either that can be extended by other having operators for different specific n, or if possible coming up with a generic operator.
