The remaining question is whether to keep 93699b9 in or rather use `-Xlint:proccesor`. I am fine with both alternatives, but I prefer to go with 93699b9 as there can be various warnings in annotation processing and having them as errors is useful. The [JDK bug](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6999068) is unlikely to be fixed and moreover we want to compile on existing JDKs anyway. \r\n\r\nIf 93699b9 is kept in, then: over time it may happen that we need to expand the list of annotations that deserve to be marked as processed. I see no problem with that. As people turn `-Werror` in certain modules, they should be ready to expand the annotation list (or to add `-Xlint:processor` - the decision can be done per each module).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/810161601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/810167690","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2835#issuecomment-810167690","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2835","id":810167690,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDE2NzY5MA==","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T12:08:37Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T12:09:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for additional thoughts @jtulach Makes sense.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/810167690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/810193517","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2818#issuecomment-810193517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2818","id":810193517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMDE5MzUxNw==","user":{"login":"jGauravGupta","id":15934072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTM0MDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15934072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta","html_url":"https://github.com/jGauravGupta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jGauravGupta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-30T12:41:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T12:41:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @matthiasblaesing ,\r\n\r\nPayara tools forked from Glassfish tools so profiles naming are also inherited.

On the \"AnagramGame\" project: Right click project and select \"Profile\".\r\n6. Click Configure Session and select \"Methods\"\r\n7. Start profiling session\r\n8. Anagram Game's window will briefly appear and then disappear. The Output Window will record a JVM crash.\r\n\r\n#### Replace with new binaries\r\n1. Exit NetBeans IDE\r\n2. Download the [profiler-external-binaries-ASF.zip](https://netbeans.osuosl.org/binaries/B1C1B951F79716EFFAB9BEC96A611844B038E2E2-profiler-external-binaries-ASF.zip) from OSUOSL and explode it onto your NetBeans IDE installation directory, folder `netbeans/profiler/`, so that files from the ZIP overwrite what you already have on your harddisk. (you should make a backup prior to this of the files that will be overwritten). \r\n3. Start the IDE.\r\n4. Do steps 1-8 again from the \"Provoke the crash\" section. The crash should now no longer happen.\r\n\r\n_For MacOS and Linux there's no crash, so the test should be that the new binaries (also) work._\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/812169211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/812357527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2854#issuecomment-812357527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2854","id":812357527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjM1NzUyNw==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-02T06:54:44Z","updated_at":"2021-04-02T06:54:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great.

So I need to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add newline to java/java.disco/external/discoclient-1.0-license.txt\r\n- [ ] Add newline at be beginning(?) of these licenses so they don't get considered as 'headers': java/java.disco/external/checker-qual-3.9.1-license.txt and java/java.disco/external/discoclient-1.0-license.txt \r\n- [ ] Add the Apache license for these other libraries: java/java.disco/external/commons-codec-1.13.jar, java/java.disco/external/commons-compress-1.20.jar, java/java.disco/external/httpclient5-5.0.3.jar, java/java.disco/external/httpcore5-5.0.2.jar, java/java.disco/external/httpcore5-h2-5.0.2.jar\r\n- [ ] Not sure what to do for these identical JARs which are used from two modules: commons-compress-1.20.jar\r\n- [ ] Add dependency to platform/o.apache.commons.codec and stop wrapping commons-codec-1.13.jar .
