thanks!\n\nYeah, I was going to suggest, that getting CI to work reliably is probably something important to the project beyond the scope of this PR.  \n\nOne thing that might offer a quick improvement, is @jeffsteinmetz's suggestion that we stop supporting older versions of Spark (e.g., 1.1, 1.2).  That should reduce the random test failures by at least 20%.   \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/205102505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/205102549","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/806#issuecomment-205102549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/806","id":205102549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTEwMjU0OQ==","user":{"login":"mwkang","id":10624086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI0MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10624086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang","html_url":"https://github.com/mwkang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwkang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T01:59:09Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T01:59:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bzz Thank you for your review.\n@corneadoug Okay, I will change the code does not use a front-end code.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/205102549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/205103615","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/208#issuecomment-205103615","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/208","id":205103615,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTEwMzYxNQ==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-04T02:11:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T02:11:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@elbamos everything looks good, except one last thing - BSD license text need to be removed from `r/src/main/scala/scala/Console.scala` header as well, as it was not there originally and we have it in a separate file, clearly pointed from root LICENSE.\n\nSorry for not pointing it out earlier, but reviewing whole 4000+LOC diff everytime at once is a bit uneasy.\n\nI think we should be good with merging it right after that.

Thus, I think having 2 notebooks with the same name (such as `/this/is/a/note`) should be valid. Then we actually allow the notebooks in the same folder having the same name. (I am trying to avoid using the term of \"file\" here, because for file systems, we do not allow files with same name in the same directory, but our case is slightly different from a typical file system).\n\nThis issue may make the implementation more complicated if we use map-like data structures, because we need to deal with the case with duplicates. Thus, I think it may be more appropriate to use list-based data structures.\n\nI do agree that the code quality is very important, and I admit that the current logic of folder construction is a little bit messy. I would like to refactor the code once we have an agreement on either to use map-based data structure or list-based data structure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/205653556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/205655152","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/796#issuecomment-205655152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/796","id":205655152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNTY1NTE1Mg==","user":{"login":"johnnyws","id":17979200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTc5MjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17979200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws","html_url":"https://github.com/johnnyws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnnyws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-05T05:41:51Z","updated_at":"2016-04-05T05:42:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just add one more comment: if we plan to forbid the users having notebooks with the same name (notebook name, not \"file\" name), we need to consider about the backward compatibility issue.\n\nI hope these statements can make you clear.
