is a huge change. I took a look over the code, but I don't have enough experience with the scheduler to understand these changes.\n\nI would suggest to merge this rather soon because its touching a lot of code due to minor scala style changes (semicolons, removal of parentheses from no-arg methods, unneeded { } and so on)\n+1 for the added documentation to the classes!\n\nThe bug in FLINK-1453 would be more obvious with these changes were merged. That's another motivation for me to push this pull request forward ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71455790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71458216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/319#issuecomment-71458216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/319","id":71458216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDU4MjE2","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-26T13:11:42Z","updated_at":"2015-01-26T13:11:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think @StephanEwen is reviewing the critical part.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71458216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71458700","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-71458700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":71458700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDU4NzAw","user":{"login":"uce","id":1756620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce","html_url":"https://github.com/uce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-26T13:15:58Z","updated_at":"2015-01-26T13:15:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wow, great news! :-)\n\nIn general, I think we really have to do something about getting the changes in.

don't really understand how the static lock solves the mentioned issue. Is there a concurrency problem between creating files on disk and updating the count hash map?\n\nI think there is a problem between the DeleteProcess and the CopyProcess. The CopyProcess is synchronized on the static lock object and the DeleteProcess is not. Thus, it might be the case that the copy method created the directories for a new file \"foobar\", let's say /tmp/123/foobar, and afterwards the delete process deletes the directory /tmp/123 because it checked the count hash map before the createTmpFile method was called which created the copy task for the file \"foobar\".\n\nThis problem should still persist with the current changes.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71488487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71489135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/339#issuecomment-71489135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/339","id":71489135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDg5MTM1","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-26T16:29:50Z","updated_at":"2015-01-26T16:30:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"but

It is difficult for me to assess how difficult it would be; the generic and python part were coded and evolved simultaneously, and when something didn't fit i could just change it to do so. I think it's very likely that when someone wants to add another language we'll have to revisit a few things, but it provides at a good starting point.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71611872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/71612618","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-71612618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":71612618,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjEyNjE4","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-27T09:06:44Z","updated_at":"2015-01-27T09:06:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dan-blanchard What non-JVM language are you looking for?\nMaybe we can do a little prototype with that language to see how well it works.

The maven junction plugin was last updated 5 years ago. Judging from the source at https://pyx4j.com/svn/pyx4j/pyx4j-maven-plugins/maven-junction-plugin everything should work fine.\n\nHowever, I found what can be considered a bug. Before removing the link, the `JunctionUnlinkMojo` checks if the link exists:\n\n```\nif (link.getDst().exists()) { \n    // remove symlink\n}\n```\n\nThis returns false in our case because by the time this check is executed, `flink-dist/target/${project.version}-bin` has already been deleted. The symlink points to a non-existing directory. Instead of checking for the destination of the symlink, we need to check the actual symlinks existence.\n\nJava 7's File has `isSymbolicLink`.

You delete the same file and the delete process is immediately executed. This would delete the file.\n3.
