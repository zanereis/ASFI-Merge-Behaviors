Multitabledeltastreamer did not work correctly in continuous mode. It did work somehow for MOR in single-run mode, but we preferred not to use it as the doc said MOR was not supported. Plus, multitabledeltastreamer runs ingestions in serial mode, not in parallel mode. \r\n\r\nFor the moment, we will stick to delta streamers, and launch them regularly (every 5-10 minutes) to process change data from Debezium or Golden Gate. Let's see what will happen for 1000 tables.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think it's optimized, as\r\n- 1 delta streamer needs at least 1 spark executor, with usually 2GB memory. Most of our tables have only a very small amount of change data (<1MB) during a 5-10 minutes' period. We might need a large Hadoop cluster with enough memory for data ingestion, transformation and PrestoSQL.  \r\n- We use spark on Yarn, so it takes 10 seconds to create a Yarn delta streamer application, which we think is not optimized either. \r\n\r\nOur final thought:\r\nIs it possible to write a long-running spark application, which listens to multiple data change topics, and writes change data in parallel to Hadoop hoodie tables via pyspark data frame?

Docusaurus doesn't have the concept of permalink in the header, the URL is formed based on the folder and file name, hence renamed all the files with the permalink to preserve the old path and to avoid broken links for the docs.\r\n2. Since the new navigation structure is different for the non-doc static pages, I've updated all the references in the document.\r\n3. Docusaurus doesn't support a few of the Jekyll features like:\r\n\r\n- The HTML class attribute should be called className, hence updated those.\r\n- In some cases, the <span> tag messes up the formatting of the content hence got rid of it.\r\n- Fixed the broken HTML tags.\r\n- For loops got converted to a theme component for the powered-by page.\r\n- Keywords should be an array instead of a comma-separated string.\r\n\r\n4. Rebuilt the left sidebar and all old docs version sidebar and the main dropdown navigation.\r\n5. Moved around a bunch of files and renamed some to support versioning and i18n support.\r\n6. Most of the classic theme looked good already out of the box, fixed a bunch of them in the src/css/custom.css.\r\n7. Rebuild the home page as a pure js rendered page src/pages/index.js.\r\n8. Built the footer navigation with all relevant links to improve the SEO and ease of use and improve the visibility of the inner pages.\r\n9. Broken the releases page to individual pages, to improve the usability and to support the left side bar.\r\n10. Broken the community page into 3 pages:\r\n- Get Involved.\r\n- Team.\r\n- How to Contribute\r\n11. Added the code tab support for the quick-start spark guide, the same could be easily applied for other pages.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [docusaurus official documentation ](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)for adding more features to the site.\r\n\r\nThis is not the final version, the first step in the process is to migrate the content as-is with few minor changes to the docusaurus platform, then we can make incremental changes to add more features.\r\n\r\nI'll be adding the search bar in the next iteration.\r\n\r\nThese sed one-liners saved the day for me!!\r\n\r\n```\r\nsed -i '' -E 's/src=(\"[^\"]*\")/src={require(\\1).default}/g' *.md\r\nsed -i '' -E 's/keywords:(.*)$/keywords: [\\1]/g' *.md\r\nsed -i '' -E 's/<br>/<br\\/>/g' *.md\r\nsed -i '' -E

But feel free to follow for any pointers.\r\n\r\n@karan867 : coming back to your use-case. \r\n1. Whats your max parquet size you are setting ? If its default, then its 120Mb files. \r\n2. Whats your avg record size? This will help determine your bloom filter numbers. \r\n3. During your first ingest, what was the config value set for \"hoodie.copyonwrite.insert.split.size\". This will determine the size of each data file(only during first ingest since hudi does not have any stats to look at to determine the record size). \r\n4. Does your record key have any timestamp ordering characteristics. If yes, then bloom type index would help us a lot. Basically every data file will have a min key and max key stored in footer and hudi will use that to trim out some data files.\r\nIf keys are random, then we can disable range pruning and see if that helps. Wrt Simple Index, you are right. it is relative to your data set size. As it grows, time for SIMPLE index time might relatively increase. \r\n5. Whats % of updates vs new inserts in your writes. \r\n6. small file disabling should work. Only updates will get routed to old data files. All new inserts should go into new data files. If not, it could be a regression. can you confirm that once. (i.e. you see inserts going to old data files even after disabling small files).  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/891916056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/891918822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2936#issuecomment-891918822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2936","id":891918822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM41KZnm","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-03T14:59:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T14:59:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@shenbinglife : Did you get a chance to try it out","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/891918822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/891920635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2409#issuecomment-891920635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2409","id":891920635,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM41KaD7","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-03T15:01:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T15:02:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dude0001 : Hey if you don't mind, can you create a new github issue. do not want to pollute this issue. since yours is not spark streaming.
