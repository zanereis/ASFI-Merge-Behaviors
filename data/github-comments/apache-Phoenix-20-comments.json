I just realized that we have this exact same issue reported sometime back this year with Phoenix 4.14.x + HBase 1.3.x for Delete queries.\r\nChanges indeed look reasonable and simpler to understand.\r\n\r\nI am confident about existence of the issue (not the fix though). And @wangchao316 seems to have been able to consistently repro this with minor changes in HBase split code by failing split all the times and let the flow through rollback of split, as per Jira comments. \r\nHowever, let's trigger a QA run first, we don't have clear QA result on PR. If we don't see any issue, I am +1 for rolling out this change, feels worth shipping.\r\n\r\n@gjacoby126 @ChinmaySKulkarni @apurtell Thought?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/736281709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/736362078","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/874#issuecomment-736362078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/874","id":736362078,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjM2MjA3OA==","user":{"login":"virajjasani","id":34790606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzkwNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani","html_url":"https://github.com/virajjasani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/virajjasani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-01T09:49:27Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T09:49:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Precommit results are available: https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/job/PreCommit-PHOENIX-Build/229/testReport/\r\nLooks good, failures don't seem relevant. +1(non-binding) for this PR.\r\nThanks @wangchao316 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/736362078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/comments/736367472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/phoenix/pull/874#issuecomment-736367472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/phoenix/issues/874","id":736367472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNjM2NzQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"chrajeshbabu","id":4728792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3Mjg3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4728792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu","html_url":"https://github.com/chrajeshbabu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrajeshbabu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-01T09:58:47Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T09:58:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1.
