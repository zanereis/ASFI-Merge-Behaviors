Actually, thinking about it again, it would break the semantics of the `registeredWorkers` map when the leader changes (because TaskManagers disconnect then).

The problem is that recovery on the master is tightly coupled to ZooKeeper (configured via `recovery.mode: ZOOKEEPER`).

Do you think it's important to fix this for 1.1 already?\n\nRegarding the name _standalone_:\n\nI fully agree. We have a standalone cluster mode and standalone recovery mode.

The underlying UGI implementation of Hadoop infrastructure is used to harden the security using the keytab cache. For Yarn mode of deployment, delegation tokens are created and populated to container environment (App Master/JM and TM). \n\nThere are two areas of improvement that current implementation lacks:\n1) Tokens will be expired in due course and hence it impacts long running jobs\n2) Missing functionality to support secure connection to Kafka and ZK (Kafka 0.9 and latest ZK versions are supporting kerberos based authentication using SASL/JAAS)\n\nThis PR addresses above gaps by providing Keytab support to securely communicate to Hadoop and Kafka/ZK services.\n\n1) Additional Configurations: \n\nBelow new security specific configurations are added to the Flink configuration file.\na) security.principal - user principal that Flink process/connectors should authenticate as \nb) security.keytab - keytab file location\n\nIn standlone mode, it is assumed that the configurations pre-exists (manual process) on all cluster nodes from where the JM and TMs will be running. \n\nIn Yarn mode, the configuration (and keytab file) is expected only on the node from where YarnCLI or FlinkCLI will be invoked. Application code takes care of copying Keytab file to JM/TM Yarn containers as local resource for lookup.\n\nIn the absence of providing security configurations, the delegation token mechanism still works to support backward compatibility (manual kinit before starting JM/TMs). For Kafka and ZK services, JAAS configurations are enabled to support Kerberos cache if keytab is not provided and the authentication mechanism will work as well.\n\n2) Process-wide in-memory JAAS configuration to enable Kafka/ZK secure authentication.\n\nThe JAAS configuration plays a critical role in authentication for Kerberized application. Kafka/ZK login module code is expected to construct a login context based on supplied JAAS configuration file entries and authenticates to produce a subject.  The context is constructed with an application name which acts as a lookup key into the configuration, yielding one or more login modules.   The login module implements the specific strategy, such as using a configured keytab or using the user’s ticket cache.\n\nInstead of managing per-connector JAAS configuration file, a process-wide JAAS configuration object is initialized during Flink bootstrap phase, thus providing a singular login module to all callers configured to login using the supplied keytab.\n(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/security/auth/login/Configuration.html#setConfiguration(javax.security.auth.login.Configuration)\n\nFor example, here is how secure Kafka connection works:\nAssuming the Kafka server side component is configured to run in secure mode, then per Kafka requirement, we need to create a JAAS configuration like below, where \"Client\" is the \"app\" name that Kafka/SASL implementation lookup to retrieve the JAAS configurations.\nClient {\n    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required\n    useKeyTab=true\n    storeKey=true\n    keyTab=\"/etc/security/keytabs/kafka.keytab\"\n    principal=\"kafka/kafka.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\";\n};\nThe PR takes care of auto-generating JAAS configuration require for secure Kafka cluster without having a need to provide per-connector JAAS entries. The same is applicable for secure ZK client connection too.\n\nThe Kafka consumer and producer properties should include following configurations to securely talk to Kafka brokers.\nsecurity.protocol SASL_PLAINTEXT    (TLS not enabled) \nsasl.kerberos.service.name <KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME>\n\nTo summarize, following sequence happens when the secure configuration is enabled.\nFlink bootstrap code (both Yarn and Standalone) initializes security context by\na) Initializing UGI with the supplied keytab and principal which takes care of handling Kerberos authentication and login renewal for Hadoop services. \nb) Creating process-wide JAAS configuration object for Kafka/ZK login modules to support Kerberos/SASL authentication. Login renewals are automatically taken care by ZK and Kafka login module implementation.\n\nSome additional details are provided in the documentation page as well that can be referenced from here.\n(https://github.com/vijikarthi/flink/blob/FLINK-3929/docs/internals/flink_security.md)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234328853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234330941","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2051#issuecomment-234330941","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2051","id":234330941,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDMzMDk0MQ==","user":{"login":"soniclavier","id":707701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzcwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/707701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier","html_url":"https://github.com/soniclavier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soniclavier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-21T17:51:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T17:51:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks Ufuk & Stephen for the reply,\n\nI tried the serializers suggested by you\n\n```\nval typeHint = new TypeHint[Tuple2[Long,String]](){}\nval serializer = TypeInformation.of(typeHint).createSerializer(null)\n\n//also tried this\nval fieldSerializers = Array[TypeSerializer[_]](StringSerializer.INSTANCE, LongSerializer.INSTANCE)\nval serializer2 = new TupleSerializer(classOf[Tuple2[Long,String]].asInstanceOf[Class[_]].asInstanceOf[Class[Tuple2[String, Long]]], fieldSerializers)\n```\n\nBut both gives me compilation error at\n\n```\nval serializedKey = KvStateRequestSerializer.serializeKeyAndNamespace(\n      key,\n      serializer2,\n      VoidNamespace.INSTANCE,\n      VoidNamespaceSerializer.INSTANCE)\n```\n\nthe compilation error is:\n\n```\nError:(43, 7) type mismatch;\nfound   : org.apache.flink.api.common.typeutils.TypeSerializer[org.apache.flink.api.java.tuple.Tuple2[Long,String]]\n required: org.apache.flink.api.common.typeutils.TypeSerializer[java.io.Serializable]\nNote: org.apache.flink.api.java.tuple.Tuple2[Long,String] <: java.io.Serializable, but Java-defined class TypeSerializer is invariant in type T.\nYou may wish to investigate a wildcard type such as `_ <: java.io.Serializable`.

Being able to use JobID etc. directly is imo less of a benefit than the utilities.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234543271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234544332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2051#issuecomment-234544332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2051","id":234544332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDU0NDMzMg==","user":{"login":"soumyasd","id":272481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjQ4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/272481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd","html_url":"https://github.com/soumyasd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumyasd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T13:31:29Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T13:31:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Any idea which Flink version this feature is going live with ? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234544332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/234557831","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2285#issuecomment-234557831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2285","id":234557831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDU1NzgzMQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T14:24:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T14:25:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The usage of the `DelagatingConfiguration` poses a few problems in regards to #2226.
