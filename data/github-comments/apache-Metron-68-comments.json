That's not quite what I suggested - it's still not using the common config we pass in\r\n> Can we add a param for the CLI like PcapOptions.PRINT_JOB_STATUS.put(commonConfig, true)\r\n\r\nIf that monitorAndPrintJob() is a blocking call, it probably belongs in the `get()` itself. Rather than creating a one-off custom method invoked by the client, we already have configuration facilities for providing these options that we use for all other options. e.g. this section https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/f17d50fbfed4fd14e5cdd5a718cc973f51d2c4bc/metron-platform/metron-pcap/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/pcap/mr/PcapJob.java#L215\r\nAnd then it's just using that property like we use the others.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/metron/blob/f17d50fbfed4fd14e5cdd5a718cc973f51d2c4bc/metron-platform/metron-pcap/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/pcap/mr/PcapJob.java#L464\r\n```\r\npublic Pageable<Path> get() throws JobException, InterruptedException {\r\n    if (PcapOptions.PRINT_JOB_STATUS.get(configuration, Boolean.class)) {\r\n        mrJob.monitorAndPrintJob();\r\n    }\r\n    for (; ; ) {\r\n      JobStatus status = getStatus();\r\n      if (status.getState() == State.SUCCEEDED\r\n          || status.getState() == State.KILLED\r\n          || status.getState() == State.FAILED) {\r\n        return getFinalResults();\r\n      }\r\n      Thread.sleep(completeCheckInterval);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only reservation I have about the monitorAndPrintJob (versus using the pcapjob's TimerTask method) is that users cannot print status in a non-blocking way. Honestly I don't see a circumstance where you would do that with stdout anyhow. It's through pcapcli, where we want the process to return only after fully completing, so I think this is fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411834353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/411874102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1156#issuecomment-411874102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1156","id":411874102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTg3NDEwMg==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-09T19:43:41Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T19:43:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @tiborm and @ruffle1986.

Watch the topology in the Storm UI and kill the packet capture utility from before, when the number of packets ingested is over 3k.\r\n6. Ensure that at at least 3 files exist on HDFS by running hadoop fs -ls /apps/metron/pcap\r\n7.

really like this feature and think it's an important improvement.  This PR is a great start and I don't see any major architectural issues.  I've added some comments inline for the really minor issues.  I noticed that application.yml in metron-config-host and metron-alerts-host is different between the 2 but I can't think of any reason why.  I didn't comment directly but it's probably worth reviewing.\r\n\r\nThere are some bigger issues I want to call out that are more complex.  \r\n\r\nI noticed there is a fairly significant gap with respect to groups and roles.  As far as I can tell it's not supported right now which is a regression from the JDBC solution currently in place.  I'm sure this is expected and will be solved in follow on tasks in this feature branch.  I do think we should set ourselves up to be able to do that in future PRs though.  \r\n\r\nIn this PR, metron-ui-host and metron-rest use 2 different authentication mechanisms for testing.  I feel they should use the same one and we should eliminate JDBC or in memory authentication all together.  To do this we need to move this testing infrastructure (the EmbeddedLdap class and supporting files, Spring properties, etc) to metron-security.  This will allow us to switch REST to a common security model during testing, which is essentially what we're doing with this feature.  I've submitted a PR with an example of how we could do that (switching REST to embedded ldap isn't included yet and should be done later to avoid conflicts with other PRs).  This will allow us to eliminate redundant properties across modules but I think the biggest benefit is that our testing will more accurately match a real installation and allow us to catch bugs sooner.\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to say we need some documentation.  I would say at a minimum the metron-rest README should be updated to reflect the new authentication approach.  Eventually it would be nice to have architectural level documentation because there are several new components/frameworks being introduced here.  I have no problem with that being done in future PRs.\r\n\r\nI also noticed there are several TODOs.  We should at some point document these as follow on tasks so we have a clear understanding of what is expected to work in each PR.

There is also some debate to be had about how roles should be used. A trivial (and in my view naive) view would be to map roles to LDAP groups. This is quite a common approach, but is also a wrong approach, Roles are logical groups of capability, not groups of user principals. I would like to see a follow on where we actually define and properly apply concepts of roles to access controlled objects in Metron, but in the short term we could definitely use the placeholder TODO here to add a naive mapping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/415333019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/415399007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1014#issuecomment-415399007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1014","id":415399007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTM5OTAwNw==","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-23T12:37:08Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T12:37:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I
