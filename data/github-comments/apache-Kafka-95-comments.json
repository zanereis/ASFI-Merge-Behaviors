Stores that have caching enabled are wrapped with a `CachedStateStore`. This has a major implication  in that any Processors that are using a `CachedStateStore` no longer use `context.forward(..)` to forward values downstream. This is because values are instead sent downstream when items are flushed from the cache - this enables us to coalesce multiple updates to the same key into fewer downstream records. So if you have a look at say, `KStreamAggregateProcessor.init(...)`, you'll see:\n\n```\n public void init(ProcessorContext context) {\n            super.init(context);\n            store = (KeyValueStore<K, T>) context.getStateStore(storeName);\n            ((CachedStateStore) store).setFlushListener(new ForwardingCacheFlushListener<K, V>(context, sendOldValues));\n        }\n```\n\nAs you can see we expect the store to be a `CachedStateStore` and we are adding the listener that will forward values when a flush occurs. Now,  as this task is about adding custom state stores, we will no longer be able to assume that the store is a `CachedStateStore`. So, in all the `Processor`s where `CachedStateStore` is currently used we would need to know/check if we are indeed using a `CachedStateStore`, and we also need to save that information as we also need to know if we should call `context.forward(..)` in the `process` method. Again, if you look at `KStreamAggregateProcessor` you'll see that we don't call `context.forward(..)`\n\nAdditionally, we need to add a type argument to `StateStoreSupplier` as we have some processors that are expecting a `KeyValueStore` and others expecting a `WindowStore`.\nThe method signatures on `KGroupedStream` etc should become:\n\n```\n<W extends Window> KTable<Windowed<K>, V> reduce(final Reducer<V> reducer,\n                                                      final Windows<W> windows,\n                                                      final StateStoreSupplier<WindowStore> storeSupplier);\n\nKTable<K, V> reduce(final Reducer<V> reducer,\n                        final StateStoreSupplier<KeyValueStore> storeSupplier);\n```\n\nand so on.\n\nPlease let us know if you are happy to continue on with this or if you'd prefer someone else picked it up. Thanks for the help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/251076437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/251116362","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1588#issuecomment-251116362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1588","id":251116362,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTExNjM2Mg==","user":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T14:12:47Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T14:12:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @dguy .

@dguy , I am working on issue. I want to address following issues to make sure that I understood your points correctly: \nIn `KStreamAggregateProcessor.init()`, there is a 'hard cast' from `KeyValueStore` to `CachedStateStore`:\n          `((CachedStateStore) store).setFlushListener(new ForwardingCacheFlushListener<K, V>(context, sendOldValues));`\n\nSo, if the instances are for example, of type `CachingKeyValueStore`, then it would make sense. However, in other cases (ex: we try to pass user defined state store of type `KeyValueStore`) I think I will throw an exception. So while passing 'external' state store supplier, we should take care of this also.\nMaybe I understood the design wrongly, please correct me if so.\n\nAnother point is:\n\nWe should give the possibility for user to select state store supplier , whether cached or not and the behavior of processor will be changed accordingly, like flushing or forwarding. Please correct me if I am wrong.

If it is we can do the cast and set the Flush listener. If it isn't an instance of `CachedStateStore` we don't cast, so don't add the listener. Also, in process we need to know if this is a `CachedStateStore` or not as if it isn't cached, then we will also need to do `context.forward()`\n\nSo you could imagine something like this for a single processor:\n\n```\n void init(ProcessorContext context) {\n    store = (KeyValueStore<K, T>) context.getStateStore(storeName);\n    if (store instanceof CachedStateStore) {\n        cached = true;\n        ((CachedStateStore) store).setFlushListener(new ForwardingCacheFlushListener<K, V>(context, sendOldValues));\n    }\n\n   void process(K key, V value) {\n      // do whatever happens in the process\n      store.put(key, value);\n      if (!cached) {\n         context.forward(...);\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nIf you search for usages of `CachedStateStore.setFlushListener` you'll see about 7 usages of this in Processors. They will all need to be changed to adopt the same pattern, so it might be worth doing this a way that doesn't require the cast etc in every `Processor`, i.e, by passing in an Object that hides the details.\n\nSo yes -  a user should be able to provide any state store supplier whether it is cached or not and the processors should still work.\n\nDoes that help?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/251616549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/251617253","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1588#issuecomment-251617253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1588","id":251617253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTYxNzI1Mw==","user":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-05T08:46:08Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T08:46:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@dguy Sure, I wanted to make sure that I am on the right spot.
