I updated the verifyMove() logic to also prevent this, since we don't allow the processor to be moved out directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387146414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387150993","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2684#issuecomment-387150993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2684","id":387150993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzE1MDk5Mw==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-07T18:02:48Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T18:02:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewing...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387150993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387159735","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2684#issuecomment-387159735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2684","id":387159735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzE1OTczNQ==","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-07T18:32:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T18:32:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are 8 checkstyle failures.

I can see that we've tackled a handful of spots that could be leaking the references, and I've seen the heap dumps showing that they are no longer concerns. The changes to the Abstract Hadoop Processors are less desirable than I'd prefer, but I agree that the API doesn't really expose what it would need to expose in order to do this more effectively, so it's a reasonable workaround. The LogRepositoryFactory change in FlowController's create* methods is good - i hadn't realized that we were doing that there, within the nar loader.\r\n\r\nWith this particular scenario, I don't think it's really replicable in a unit test. All that could be done in unit tests would be to verify that very trivial functionality like \"removeLogger() calls remove() on the underlying map\" which make for bad unit testing IMO. You could attempt to create some very involved integration tests, but they would involve mocking out so much that it would be hard to know what is really being verified. On top of that, you still would not be able to verify that the appropriate objects are reclaimable via garbage collection.\r\n\r\nThis all looks good to me, though.

There is an outstanding need to sort out the security configuration.  For SSLContext stuff those things should utilize the standard mechanism of obtaining that as you can follow from a number of other processors.  Also, there is a kerberos context for security setting but there does not appear to be any associated settings for the user.  The security configurations should be removed in favor of simple/digest for now OR completed and with some consistency to other items.  For security relevant things CVEs become a concern so we take these more seriously.  For things about the performance/logic of the processor interaction with MarkLogic that we can improve over time if needed but security we want to get right up front.  The other thing that needs to happen is the nar bundles need their LICENSE/NOTICE file(s) added if necessary.  I looked at one of the nars and there would definitely need to be entries.  Please try adding these in like other nars and I'm happy to help tweak it to get it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions on how to achieve any of the above please ask.  Show an example nar you looked at which is similar so that we can best help close remaining gaps but from a place of good examples that you've looked at.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387820899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387848281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2688#issuecomment-387848281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2688","id":387848281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzg0ODI4MQ==","user":{"login":"scottyaslan","id":6797571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan","html_url":"https://github.com/scottyaslan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottyaslan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-09T19:24:54Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T19:24:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @mcgilman this has been merged to master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387848281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387919302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2518#issuecomment-387919302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2518","id":387919302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzkxOTMwMg==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-10T01:02:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T01:02:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MikeThomsen Thanks for the updates. It mostly looks good. The only concern I have is the gap between the name of NAR and the HBase client version. One possible solution is to rename the NAR from `nifi-hbase_1_1_2-client-service` to `nifi-hbase_1_1_x-client-service` or `nifi-hbase_1_1-client-service`, to avoid having too specific version in it so that we can update it in the future, assuming NiFi can pick the right NAR for existing flow when user upgrade NiFi even nar name changes.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with that approach, or to keep discussion on that specific topic separately, would you revert the HBase dependency version back to 1.1.2 for this PR, and submit another JIRA to do the version bump? Then we can close this one.\r\n\r\n@bbende Any comment from you on this subject would be appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387919302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/387920173","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2542#issuecomment-387920173","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2542","id":387920173,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NzkyMDE3Mw==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-10T01:08:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T01:08:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@MikeThomsen Just wanted to check.

However, when I tested with various unhappy paths including no Kerberos Credentials Service and a bad keytab, it seems we could be handling these situations better. \r\n\r\nIn the first case (no credentials), the /sessions endpoint will return HTML not JSON. This causes a bulletin to be issued, but the flow file is not penalized and/or the processor is not yielded, and the LivyControllerService thread to manage the sessions exits, meaning the flow will never proceed until the CS is restarted with the correct credentials. This could be considered a Livy bug (I didn't see an existing Jira), but we need to handle it for now.\r\n\r\nI believe something similar happens for a bad keytab, but I didn't trace it back to the manageSessions thread or anything. I think we need to ensure that the manageSessions() thread is always running while the CS is enabled, we can pass any exceptions back to the CS so when the processor makes a call to the CS, we can throw the appropriate exception,

At some point, it looks like you accidentally did a pull on upstream master into your branch. The fact that you keep having over 200 commits even with rebasing against master very strongly suggests that.

So I locally rebased against master, did a forced push and it dropped it down to ~7 commits.\r\n\r\nSo carefully follow the four steps I gave you:\r\n\r\n1. git checkout master\r\n2. git pull upstream master\r\n3. git checkout NIFI-4914\r\n4. git rebase master\r\n\r\n**Make sure** that `upstream` is changed to whatever you call `apache/nifi` on github.com.
