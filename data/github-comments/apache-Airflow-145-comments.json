In the DB the primary key is `id` with a DB sequence, see the [migration script](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/migrations/versions/64de9cddf6c9_add_task_fails_journal_table.py#L47) and the schema below. The table and the model class were introduced in #1712, there you can see that the model class and the migration script don't match. My guess is that the model class was copied form the TaskInstance class. (I just see another thing, the `duration` column is defined as float in the model class but as integer in the DB)\r\n\r\nFor each failed attempt a [row is added](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/models.py#L1721) to the `task_fail` table, which somehow already works with the existing code. Until now there is no code that retrieves data from `task_fail`.

In the worst case, this could increase processing time for people who put many non-dag Python files in the top-level directory;\r\n\r\nSorry, it was more of a drive by comment, by mess up, I meant operationally, as it might result in a larger number of files parsed, but not that it would prevent Dags from being loaded. Some colocated python scripts could call an expensive resource (and we have seen this in the past). It also not only the top level directory since we are doing an os.walk in collect_dags.\r\n\r\nI agree that the check probably needs to be refined, but it does not seem completely crazy that the words airflow/DAG should be in a module creating a DAG, if only in a docstring at the top of the file. It is definitely good to document/we could expand the actual check though to more than just those two strings. \r\n\r\n`.airflowignore` is fine, but it does not address the issue at hand as it is more of a dev facility than a production one. You would have to add all the non dag files which you want to ignore there. What happens if someone has a DAG file named the same as the script you are trying to exclude...?\r\n\r\nComplete agreed with you on the zipfile front, the check should probably look into all files, and if any are found, return. I would welcome a PR which would make that change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/397521015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/397522332","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3499#issuecomment-397522332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3499","id":397522332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzUyMjMzMg==","user":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T06:03:01Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T06:03:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sekikn @jgao54 @feng-tao PTAL","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/397522332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/397561602","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3507#issuecomment-397561602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3507","id":397561602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzU2MTYwMg==","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T09:09:23Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T09:09:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wjlow The list is alphabetically ordered.
