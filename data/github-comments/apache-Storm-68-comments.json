</p>\n\n<p>One of the goals was to allow developers to use existing spouts and bolts without have to write custom wrappers, etc. For example, you can use the stock kafka spout without writing any custom code. Dealing with components that use builder/configuration methods is not yet implemented, but has been noted in the github issues.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the intent was that this could be added as a component in /external.
