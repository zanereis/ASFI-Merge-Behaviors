I prefer to tell user actual exception, and permit downstream framework to handle related exception, such as provide a cache to handle requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Besides, except modifying datasource ip, there are many other scenes that would trigger a `DataSourceChangedEvent`, such as modify datasource account, queryTimeout, maxActive etc. \r\n\r\nI don't think we should guess user's behavior, only we should to do are returning truth to user.\r\nHow do you know user expect to change database ip or account configuration? As my understanding, a production database should not change their account frequently. \r\nIf ShardingSphere should separate account change and ip change, that is another story. this pull request is not enough now, we still need do more.\r\n\r\nAnd for the second problem, more cost of create 2 different data source, this solution cannot resolve yet.\r\n\r\nAs my understanding, this solution cannot resolve data insert/update/delete correctly, and will introduce new problem(more cost of connection).

If user really meet this scene, user can call `HintManager.close()` method to clear hint info by themselves.\r\n> \r\n> ShardingSphere provide to way to clear hint info.\r\n> \r\n>     1.

User call `HintManager.close()`， yes，we now manage hints by myself，calling`HintManager.close()`，but at the same time we remove the `HintManager.close()` in `connection.close()` (we not use ss v3.0.0)，it works fine\r\n\r\nfor 2. User call `connection.close()`， it is another bug，db connection is managed by pool too，connection.close() should not be called when the db connection retrieved","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/465474331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/465484810","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1829#issuecomment-465484810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/1829","id":465484810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NTQ4NDgxMA==","user":{"login":"tuohai666","id":24643893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjQzODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24643893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666","html_url":"https://github.com/tuohai666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tuohai666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-20T08:58:31Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T08:58:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Resolved via https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/issues/1830.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/465484810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
