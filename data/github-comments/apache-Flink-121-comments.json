As you have suggested, I could keep just one or two tests for each of the modules to cut down the running time, if that's okay with you?\n\nThanks! Yes, please just one test per entity (HDFS, Yarn, Kafka/Zookeeper). Could you also convert the Kafka test to using `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass`? You don't necessarily have to duplicate code. How about changing the test base to include a method to instantiate the secure settings? I think you'll need to add an abstract method in `KafkaTestEnvironment`, e.g. loadSecureSettings(), then add another one in `KafkaTestBase`, e.g. getTestEnvironmentClass(), to load the appropriate test environment (secure/non-secure). You will have additional classes that implement these two methods. These classes will be very short as they just overload the method. This is cleaner although a bit more verbose.\n\n> I am open to keep just 3 classes for each scenarios (HDFS, Yarn & Kafka) as you have suggested but in my opinion that will defeat the idea of reusing existing test program.\n\nI understand but we're actually just increasing the testing time and not gaining much from running multiple security tests for the same component.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/239197266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/239199122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2340#issuecomment-239199122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2340","id":239199122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTE5OTEyMg==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T15:36:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T15:36:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks!

I can add a test case to ensure both the configs are accepted.\n\n> The other variables should match, e.g.\n> recovery.jobmanager.port => high-availability.jobmanager.port and also recovery.zookeeper.\\* => recovery.zookeeper.\\* etc.\n\nI see. I had this doubt but since the PR was talking about this specific param I thought that would be enough. +1 to change all relevant ones. I can update it in the next PR. \n\nThanks all for the comments. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/239358299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/239358665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2342#issuecomment-239358665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/2342","id":239358665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTM1ODY2NQ==","user":{"login":"ramkrish86","id":3690658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTA2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3690658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86","html_url":"https://github.com/ramkrish86","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramkrish86/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-12T04:29:45Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T04:29:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Just a query,\nIf there are both old and new configs available -  we should give priority to the new one right?

But in specific situation, we may need some temporary compromise do make the system work well, and then remove the  compromised points latter as soon as possible .\nI think both approaches have shortcomes.  When the state is large such as millions of KVs per db, full async approach can do the full async backup, but will cost a lot of time to restore which may be intolerable while doing fail-over in production. So I think it is necessary to have both, and the full async can be the default option. \n\nConsidering that there is no really perfect solution yet, I think It is OK to remove the semi-async way right now to avoid blocking the job of key group but need to reintroduce a better solution latter soon if you agree that rocksdb is quite a good choice of statebackend in large state situations. \n\nRegrading to the overhead of memory in different dbs.

It's very poorly documented and overly complex. The change looks good and ensures that a staged buffer that cannot be decoded because of a closed buffer pool does not leave the channel with auto read set to false.
