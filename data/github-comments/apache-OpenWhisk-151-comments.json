However, for this to be a serious alternative compared to building microservices we need to have proper versioning. Otherwise it will be very hard to convince customers that they can only have 1 active version of their function in production at any given time, and they can't specify which version to invoke. Furthermore, when upgrading a function, there is no way to perform blue-green or canary deployments so upgrading becomes a very risky business.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that semantic versioning is the ideal solution. First, I think it's more than is needed, and secondly, what about invoking an action and asking for version>0.0.1 and there's several versions that satisfy the condition. Which version should be chosen? \r\n\r\nWorking with API:s, many vendors provide the ability to assign any arbitrary tag as a version number, and that's all that is needed. The same could be applied here, which also would give one the option of using GitHub commit tags as version numbers, just as we do with image tags.\r\n\r\nAnother question that comes to mind is how to refer to versions in the API and CLI. Starting with the API, there is no de-facto standard for resource versioning. Some suggest using path parameters, others suggest request parameters or http headers such as *Accept* or *If-Match* with ETags, or even custom headers. A clear advantage of using a header would be that this will not break v1 of the API. For the CLI we would just add a *--version* flag for the appropriate commands. But how should we handle when the version is omitted? If we use the notion of a *default* version, which the user could indicate using a *--default* flag (default true) when creating or updating an entity, we could fall back to this default version. The difference between a *default* version and the latest version is that they are not necessarily the same.\r\n\r\nOnce we implement versioning, we can move on to routing. Being able to specify a version to invoke, we can implement green-blue and canary deployments. To be able to support canary deployments, we need a way to specify load-balancing between versions. If all actions where fired trough triggers, we could use rules for this, but I don't think they are. Invoking an action through the API doesn't involve any trigger or rule, so either we would have to implement some kind of default trigger/rule for this under the hood, or we need a new entity for load-balancing that the controller can use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/462784493/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/462810508","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/4272#issuecomment-462810508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4272","id":462810508,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MjgxMDUwOA==","user":{"login":"bdelacretaz","id":81101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz","html_url":"https://github.com/bdelacretaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdelacretaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-12T15:43:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T15:43:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for this initiative!\r\n\r\nI think the main goal is for those messages to be found at https://lists.apache.org/ but maybe some channels deserve to be directly exposed to the OpenWhisk dev and users lists?

No problem removing the *init* attribute. But, the *binary* attribute is still used in the response from the PUT operation, as well as in GET action and GET actions. It's also present in the database (tested with image openwhisk/controller:5e94e0b), so I suggest leaving that attribute as is. It's not a mandatory one so it should be fine. We can modify the description of the attribute and let people know it's not being used for PUT. If that's OK I can incorporate this in the PR I'm about to submit that contains several other fixes to the Swagger spec.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/463094779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/463109333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/4273#issuecomment-463109333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4273","id":463109333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzEwOTMzMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-13T08:42:33Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T08:42:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

If so, there is still a risk I think in case that other test uses the container before the interval is up that resets the counter. I don't see other tests sharing the same action that uses `concurrent.js`\r\n\r\nOr is this a case where of the 4 activations - one (or more) take > 30s to arrive, which results in rejection? If one arrives after another is rejected, I expect the container to be destroyed and not reused.
