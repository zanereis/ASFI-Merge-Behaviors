had an initial look into the issue.\r\n\r\nI already have a branch which adds the correct namespaces when creating new jsf pages and shows tag suggestions when using `Shift + Space`.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that the information for these suggestions are based (at least for maven projects) from a bundles JSF 2.2 taglib jar.  Which seems to be used for all jsf versions.\r\nI guess the main problem is that the taglib.xml (which is used to generate the autosuggestions) are not part of the faces-api itself. They seem to be bundled with the implementation. So in order to show any suggestions a implementation needs to be provided somehow - which is a little bit weird as the tags are defined in the faces spec, so I don't see the point not providing them within the faces-api.jar\r\n\r\nCurrently I don't see an easy option to fetch the taglib matching the used faces version in your project. So we only show JSF 2.2 taglib information and we need to manually map the namespaces somehow based on the used faces version of the project.\r\n\r\n/cc @mbien ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1595955212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1596233030","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6091#issuecomment-1596233030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6091","id":1596233030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5fJJVG","user":{"login":"BradWalker","id":930871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/930871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/BradWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-18T18:35:24Z","updated_at":"2023-06-18T18:35:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hey @matthiasblaesing ,\r\n\r\nI could use some clarification here.

As such, the identity implied by the signing certificate is not reliable. This could be a result of the application being compromised at the point of download. Or it could simply be the result of errors occurring during signing, or in a software update process — the latter is depressingly common, even and especially for built-in macOS apps.

I also downloaded Apparency and verified the two on my M1 test machine.\r\n\r\nThe NBPackage app bundle task and the scripts in the main repository have a different approach to finding libraries (inc. those bundled in JARs) to sign.  NBPackage also uses the hardened runtime.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans-nbpackage/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/netbeans/nbpackage/macos/MacOS.java\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans-nbpackage/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/netbeans/nbpackage/macos/AppBundleTask.java\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/nbbuild/installer/mac/newbuild/commonfiles/signNativeBinaries.sh\r\n\r\nI wondered if something had changed in the list of files, particularly if something just on x86_64, but that doesn't seem to be the case as far as I can tell.  Anyway, Apache NetBeans 17 also reports the same issue after installation.\r\n\r\nIt's curious that everything is passing notarization anyway.  Another potential issue in the ASF installer is the `populate_caches` script -\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/nbbuild/installer/mac/newbuild/commonfiles/postinstall/populate_caches.sh\r\n\r\nThis seems to be trying to launch from the wrong location, and then writing to a file called `exiting` in the root of the app.  That might be breaking the signature?\r\n\r\n> If the application bundle remained constant you can create your own package installer and it simply updates the previous version since the name/path is the same vs having to add additional scripting/workflow to remove the previous version name.\r\n\r\nYes, all the Codelerity installers are set to do in-place upgrades.  It seems the more sensible option now we're releasing every 3 months.\r\n\r\n> Let me know if you need me to test anything else.\r\n\r\nThanks!  I'm going to check about using NBPackage to build a macOS bundle without JDK, and some testing of that would be useful.

This is indeed a worst-case. I think, that we are seeing a problem in the NetBeans lexer infrastructure when characters outside the basic Unicode Plane are encountered.\r\n\r\nOne problematic character in that file is the code point 66349. That code point is:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.compart.com/de/unicode/U+1032D\r\n\r\nIn java we normally deal with `char`s or character arrays. The 16bit size of char limits it to the BMP. For that reason Java encodes codepoints outside of the BMP as surrogate pairs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U+D800_to_U+DFFF).\r\n\r\nIt seems, that at least one problem is, that the antlr lexer does not expect surrogate pairs and so we would need to recombine first and feed the resulting int into the lexer. A quick test looks promising. However the rendering is still off. I'll look further into this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1605564798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1605608048","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6091#issuecomment-1605608048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6091","id":1605608048,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5fs6Jw","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-24T16:00:55Z","updated_at":"2023-06-24T16:00:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll take a look at how ANTLR4 Support handles exceptions as time permits.
