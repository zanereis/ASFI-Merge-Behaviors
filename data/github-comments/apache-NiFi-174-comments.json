When using ReplaceText in a flow, I found a buffer size < 8k never caused the BufferOverflowException.

Otherwise, ReplaceText will not fail FlowFiles with lines larger than the buffer size (and less than 8 KB).

Thanks for digging into this issue and developing a new test @greyp9! The ClientProvider changes make sense.\r\n> \r\n> The new test is helpful, and covers a lot of ground. It does a lot of work, and it seems to stretch the boundary of a unit test versus an integration test. In light of having existing unit tests for FTP processors, it seems better to maintain a minimal unit test, and then provide this new test class as an integration test. As noted in the detailed comments, there are several ways the test could be optimized. Supporting an external FTP server is also useful, and could be parameterized through System properties or environment variables.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think about changing the test to an integration test, an updating existing unit tests with more minimal changes to incorporate evaluation of UTF-8 encoding?\r\n\r\nI've renamed to *IT to align with integration test naming convention.

I think this gets us really far down field. I left some comments inline, mostly around terminology / naming conventions, and documentation. I also think the tests that were added are really helpful, but I feel like some of the code is super repetitive and some of the sets of assertions can be easily refactored into a method so that the code is a little cleaner & less verbose - unless I missed some discrepancy between very similar chunks of code that are actually different.\r\n\r\nJust pushed another commit; it should address the issues you noted.\r\n\r\nThere were some efficiencies to be gained in the unit tests, but the variables needed to verify behavior made the suggested refactor difficult.

It's a more robust one, I like it. However it is lacking the empty string as a valid unit which was supported in the previous version.

But after checking again the original code, I see that empty unit was not allowed because NON_EMPTY_VALIDATOR was used. Probably I missed that in your original change. Now I'm a bit confused and I'm not sure which one was your intention.\r\n\r\nThanks for persevering through the feedback @patalwell, I think this is just about good to go!\r\n\r\n@nandorsoma As you noted, the `NON_EMPTY_VALIDATOR` would prohibit an empty value for the unit.
