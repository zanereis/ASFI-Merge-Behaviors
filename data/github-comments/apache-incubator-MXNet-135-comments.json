This was due to the topological sort issue of LSTM. Traditionally, the topological order of backward pass is always the reverse order of the forward pass. This means the forward traditionally goes from left to right, down to up, and the backward goes in the reverse direction.  \r\n\r\nIn the NNVM pass, there is no strict order of backward pass, which goes by PostOrderDFS, with the gradient out and the softmax as head.\r\nSo what happened is follow\r\n\r\nThe current graph have\r\n```\r\nEmbedding -> SliceChannel\r\n                          -> t0_i2h -> t0 LSTM\r\n                                         |\r\n                             t1_i2h -> t1 LSTM\r\n```\r\nIn the gradient calculation pass, we do postDFS for embedding_weight_grad, which requires SliceChannel grad, and requires t0_i2h_backward and t1_i2h_backward.\r\nNote that because there is no dependency between t0_i2h and t1_i2h, they can be ordered arbitrarily, and in this case, they are ordered to be t0, t1, while the\r\nideal case should have been t1 t0.\r\n\r\nTo fix this case, we will be adding a control flow dependency in the sum aggregation nodes, when there is no existing order between them, to ensure that the order is enforced.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/264733628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/264733917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3784#issuecomment-264733917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3784","id":264733917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDczMzkxNw==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-04T21:44:45Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T21:44:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@feiyulv  can you see if it fixes the problem?

That would require MKL. But I doubt the problem is with MKL. There are 2 problems above:\r\n\r\n1. GPU out-of-memory (while mini-batches are of same size, so why?)\r\n\r\n2. CPU 100x slower on 10x data. Since last post I tried out keras with Tensorflow backend it's 10x train time on 10x data (not 100x). \r\n\r\nAny ideas why 1 and 2 above?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265025354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265026793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/4101#issuecomment-265026793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4101","id":265026793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTAyNjc5Mw==","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T00:48:27Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T00:48:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"We have test for Reshape but not for Flatten.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265026793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/265028378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/4099#issuecomment-265028378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4099","id":265028378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTAyODM3OA==","user":{"login":"Primus-zhao","id":16428132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDI4MTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16428132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao","html_url":"https://github.com/Primus-zhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Primus-zhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-06T00:57:51Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T00:57:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"thks!
