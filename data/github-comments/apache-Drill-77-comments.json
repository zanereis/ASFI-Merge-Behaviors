All \"limit 0 shortcut\" config opts that I could see were enabled.  I know the present-day Parquet readers are their own animals entirely, entirely unlike EVF style readers, but I thought this anecdote might be of interest since the same LIMIT 0 case is being addressed here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1028677289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1028704625","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2450#issuecomment-1028704625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2450","id":1028704625,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc49UMlx","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-03T08:06:48Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T08:06:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnturton, you an mark the big one as a draft.

And in separate new commit removed the hack, which hid the schema change in the `HashAggTemplate` (and actually one row is missing in query result, just actually test case doesn't check it).\r\nThanks for explanation how vectors is working, it helped me. It is clear now, that schema is changing due to `RepeatedMapVector` [can't be obtained from the cache](https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/317f164791bbbe8f937eb452b49e92c34f1c0333/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/physical/resultSet/impl/ColumnBuilder.java#L220):\r\n```\r\n      // Don't get the map vector from the vector cache. Map vectors may\r\n      // have content that varies from batch to batch.

You did indeed find the hole in the system. Map (and repeated map) vectors are special: they are just holders for the actual data vectors. If they are reused, we get all the previous map members, which may or may not be a problem. I guess it would be a problem if reader 1 has a.b be an INT, while reader 2 wants a.b to be a VARCHAR.\r\n\r\nI guess a question is whether the HashAgg maintains a pointer to the map itself, or only the physical columns within it. It has no pointers to the map itself, we can special-case maps: they are considered the same schema if their contents are the same, whether or not the map vector itself is the same.\r\n\r\nAnother choice would be to store the map vector in the cache, but strip all the physical columns out of it when the caller asks for it again. The caller then reassembles the physical columns, also from the cache, and hopefully creates the same map structure as the previous reader.\r\n\r\nBased on what you learned of the HashAgg, which of these might work?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1030499963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1030531217","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2215#issuecomment-1030531217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2215","id":1030531217,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc49bKiR","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-05T05:28:48Z","updated_at":"2022-02-05T05:28:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@luocooong, here are a few more thoughts. First issues, then solutions.\r\n\r\nInstalling a plugin on a running system is a bit hard, as you've discovered. Looks like I had some earlier comments. Adding a new plugin requires some kind of coordination: it can't be used on any node until it is available on all nodes.\r\n\r\nThe plugin config system is still a bit brittle. The config can't go into ZK until the plugin is available on all nodes. Else, when a node tries to deserialize the config, it will fail because the plugin config class is not (yet) available.\r\n\r\nThe situation for upgrades is worse: it is hard to remove the existing classes, and references. (Special design must be done to allow classes to be unloaded.) Such replacement can only be done when we know no queries are running that need the plugin.\r\n\r\nPlugins are not as easy to manage as UDFs, so the approach used for dynamic UDFs (which was already a bit complex), probably won't work for plugins. For one, UDFs have no ZK-based config file. On the other hand, the complexity of UDFs comes from preventing race conditions: from ensuring that the UDF is available to all nodes before allowing a query to reference the UDF.\r\n\r\nSo, solutions. The simplest is to use Drill's graceful shutdown feature and simply restart each Drillbit. This process also works for a patch release, to change the memory allocated to Drill, etc. So, you should already have a rolling restart mechanism available anyway if you are running Drill in prouction. If so, then just use that mechanism for adding a new plugin.\r\n\r\nThe process would be:\r\n\r\n* Install the plugin jar on every node. (See below.)\r\n* Use graceful shutdown to perform a rolling restart: shut down and restart nodes one at a time. This is safe because there should be no configs in ZK for the new plugin, which means queries can use the plugin on the nodes that have loaded it.\r\n* When all Drillbits are restarted, write the plugin config into ZK.\r\n* Once the plugin config is picked up by the nodes, queries can be issued against nodes.\r\n\r\nThe config is needed only on the node acting as the Foreman: all other nodes get the required config handed to them in the physical plan. So, no worry about race conditions in plugin config rollout.\r\n\r\nOne thing Drill is lacking is simple REST APIs for management. There should be an API to trigger graceful shutdown. Another to post a config. (There are a few APIs, but they are designed for use by the UI. Better than nothing.)\r\n\r\nOne other item: I notice that the proposed code change adds a plugin class path to the Drill config. That's not really needed. If you use the `--site <path>` option, then all your unique files (configs, UDFs, plugins) can reside in your custom conifg directory. Drill adds the `$DRILL_CONF/lib` directory to the class path. (Double check, I'm writing this from memory, being the guy who added this feature.) So, your custom plugins simply go into that custom config directory.\r\n\r\nLonger term, we should add classloader isolation for plugins. Without that, your new plugin could bring down the system if, say, you use a version of Guava that conflicts with Drill's. The same is true of the many other dependencies.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1030531217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1030830633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2419#issuecomment-1030830633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2419","id":1030830633,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc49cTop","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-06T13:16:36Z","updated_at":"2022-02-06T13:16:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> \r\n\r\n@paul-rogers I re-ran the tests and everything passed.

The function must, however, declare an output type. The other input must be cast to the correct type. For example, if the VARCHAR is to be cast to a DECIMAL, so must the other argument, and the output is DECIMAL.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we infer the type from the numeric type, then 10 + \"10.1\" will produce 20, not 20.1.\r\n\r\nSQL is a statically typed language: every row must produce the output type. Drill does defer the type decision to runtime, but the type decision becomes frozen on the first row.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, what is the output type for:\r\n\r\nVARCHAR + INT --> ?\r\nVARCHAR + DOUBLE --> ?\r\nVARCHAR + DECIMAL -> ?\r\n\r\nSince the VARCHAR can be anything, the safest result is if the output is always VARDECIMAL (unlimited precision) or DOUBLE (largest range of values, with some truncation). For any other output type, we can invent an input that will make the output type invalid.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is why SQL normally requires:\r\n\r\n(CAST col AS INT) + 10 --> BIGINT\r\n\r\nSo that the user declares that the VARCHAR \"col\" column is converable to INT, and thus the normal INT addition type promotion rules apply.\r\n\r\nOr, have you come up with some trick to work around this issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1047290649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1047874548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2461#issuecomment-1047874548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2461","id":1047874548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc4-dUv0","user":{"login":"estherbuchwalter","id":85584805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTg0ODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85584805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/estherbuchwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/estherbuchwalter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-22T14:50:30Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T14:50:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@paul-rogers, thank you for your question.

The goal here is that Drill should not throw an error, and thereby put a halt on all of the query results, when one value within a large dataset is a different data type than what the Math function originally expected. Instead it should either know how to handle the different data type or return a value that conveys that the input was invalid (like `null`, `NaN`, etc).\r\nFor example, before this PR the following SQL query would send a Drill error: `SELECT abs('-10')`. However, with this PR, the correct value would be returned (it would be returned as a Float8Holder).\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems that this functionality would be consistent with industry standards.

Can I convert this PR out of draft and review it?\r\n\r\nYes, I think it is ready. I didn't find optimal memory configs fo Travis build. Since there is [7.5Gb](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/overview/#virtualisation-environment-vs-operating-system) ENV memory limit. So there are 3 ways:\r\n1. long term: optimize Drill memory usage, like it was earlier\r\n2. to use paid plan for Travis.com builds\r\n3. to disable 2 forks for Maven build for Travis, because it uses more memory, than one fork. So it will be longer, but it will be less loaded on memory.\r\n\r\nI've chosen third for now and found the build still faster than GitHub CI builds. So the solution looks fine to me.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1059987103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1060057561","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2484#issuecomment-1060057561","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2484","id":1060057561,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc4_LzHZ","user":{"login":"cgivre","id":5513150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTMxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre","html_url":"https://github.com/cgivre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgivre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-06T23:07:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-06T23:07:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hboutemy Thanks for this PR.

For one thing, there is no need for distribution when reading a 10MB (or 100MB) CSV file. For another thing, the compromises made in the days of old with big data don't apply to desktop use. (In fact, much of Drill's machinery is overkill when Drill is run as a single process.)\r\n\r\nDrill 2.0 is an opportunity to reorient Drill away from fading big data space and toward the data science use cases that most PRs now seem to support. (It's not that big data itself is gone, it'd just that most folks who need that kind of scale now run in the cloud where Drill is not common.) As one of many examples, REST APIs make no sense at scale, but do make sense for a \"small data\" tool.\r\n\r\nOr, have two Drill additions, the old-school \"distributed systems\" edition and the newer \"data science edition\". Those who still need Drill to work distributed can keep that edition going (along with the big data CSV quirks), while the data science folks can fork the data science edition, chuck the distributed systems stuff that gets in the way, and focus on things that data scientists do (such as reading Excel and PDF files.)\r\n\r\nA step in that direction would be to create a \"data science edition\" for things like the CSV reader: have it require headers (to avoid the need to use the odd `columns` column.) Go ahead and sample the first 20 or 100 rows like Pandas does to infer types. Don't worry about distributed scans. And so on. Much of the distributed-systems weirdness can be ignored when running single process on small files. (Drill was created for the opposite reasons: the prior small data tools don't work at scale.)\r\n\r\nUsers at scale will use the \"distributed\" versions of the readers, those who run Drill embedded, or single-server can enable the \"desktop\" versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1073482655/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1073519845","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2485#issuecomment-1073519845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2485","id":1073519845,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc4__Jzl","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-21T06:22:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T06:22:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **introduces 3 alerts** and **fixes 3** when merging 82e1055524ac9543bc6ff9132f9e43880b24edb3 into 7ef203b840f873fca0625d2fe77d9d4fab6ad99f -

(It's not that big data itself is gone, it'd just that most folks who need that kind of scale now run in the cloud where Drill is not common.) As one of many examples, REST APIs make no sense at scale, but do make sense for a \"small data\" tool.\r\n> Or, have two Drill additions, the old-school \"distributed systems\" edition and the newer \"data science edition\". Those who still need Drill to work distributed can keep that edition going (along with the big data CSV quirks), while the data science folks can fork the data science edition, chuck the distributed systems stuff that gets in the way, and focus on things that data scientists do (such as reading Excel and PDF files.)\r\n\r\n@paul-rogers supporting two editions of Drill would be even harder for our small band of developers than supporting one, surely?  Also, I think it would be a major loss to unpick all of the MPP work done in Drill to make big data queryable, in any notional edition.  Indeed, for a small-data-only query engine, I doubt that there would be any sense in starting from Drill at all.  A fresh start based on Calcite, Pandas or Julia would be simpler and cleaner.\r\n\r\nMany people do their big data processing in the cloud but not all of them want the vendor lock-in of the SAAS products so prefer to deploy open source in the cloud.  Others remain on-prem.  In addition, I still contend that the worlds of small and big data are not disjoint, and that a single system that can query over many storages, formats and data sizes is valuable to a viable audience.  If the contrib/ plugins can be sufficiently separated away from the rest of Drill then the variability in their scalability and behaviour is quarantined away from core Drill.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1076404891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1077279388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2485#issuecomment-1077279388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2485","id":1077279388,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5ANfqc","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T06:24:37Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T06:24:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jnturton you make good points. I somewhat worry that folks who build large distributed systems are a bit under-represented in our current wonderful group of contributors, so I do see a drift toward small-scale concerns. (For example, I've never seen any shop query 1000s of Excel files, but folks do that every day for JSON, Parquet and CSV.)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the data science folks want Drill do to it all in SQL. But, at scale, people build out data pipelines so that the files which Drill queries are the result of a process to produce a query-optimized format such as well-partitioned Parquet.\r\n\r\nThe idea of having two forks (or modes) was an attempt to preserve Drill's distributed system heritage, while also allowing the current contributors to go wild on the data science use cases.\r\n\r\nMaybe a simpler solution is to just have different \"bootstrap\" files: the at-scale edition, the data science edition, etc. Each addition includes plugins and defaults optimized for the target use case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1077279388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/1077311337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/2485#issuecomment-1077311337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/2485","id":1077311337,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFa5xc5ANndp","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-24T07:18:57Z","updated_at":"2022-03-24T07:18:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased on master.
