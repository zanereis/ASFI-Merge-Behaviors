We don't need to keep the connections all the way. It wastes the connection resources if most threads have been idle for a long time. Also, the connection pool will not bring extra cost if threads are busy writing data into database, since the connections in the pool will be reused. \r\n\r\nI googled just now and find the `MiniConnectionPoolManager ` descriptions [here](http://www.source-code.biz/miniconnectionpoolmanager/).  Maybe we can use it. \r\n\r\nBest, Hequn\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/404992552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/404996566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/5982#issuecomment-404996566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/5982","id":404996566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDk5NjU2Ng==","user":{"login":"sihuazhou","id":7480427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODA0Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7480427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou","html_url":"https://github.com/sihuazhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sihuazhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-14T03:58:26Z","updated_at":"2018-07-14T03:58:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@StephanEwen Thanks!

I agree that we should support `flink-cli < query01.sql` or `echo \"INSERT INTO bar SELECT * FROM foo\" | flink-cli`. However, I would move this to a separate issue because I'm not sure how well we support multilines and EOF right now. With the `-u` flag the user also gets the correct error code after the submission, with `flink-cli < query01.sql` the CLI would either stay in interactive mode or always return success. I would keep the `-u` flag for now for testing purposes. We could remove it from the CLI help and leave it as an internal parameter for now.

But there seems a little question, I want to consult you.\r\n\r\nThe question is about the ActorSystem, you suggested add the uncaught exception handler for the `ActorSystem`. To do this, we should extend the `ActorSystemImpl` (the default implementation). This class's constructor has [many parameters](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/ActorSystem.scala#L651). I am not very familiar with it. So I tried fill the [\"default\" params](https://github.com/yanghua/flink/blob/27dec5d60d2e799aeea66013b3da904cec137408/flink-runtime/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/runtime/akka/RobustActorSystem.scala#L33). I ran the test case, they always failed because of the fifth parameter. \r\n\r\nSo the question is the `ActorSystemImpl` is marked as `InternalApi `, it may be changed in the future, shall we extend a actor system based with it? If yes, what's the correct value for these parameter?\r\n\r\nI saw some similar customized case, such as [this](https://gist.github.com/aarondav/ca1f0cdcd50727f89c0d#file-exceptioncatchingactorsystemimpl-scala-L14) and [this](https://gist.github.com/Kayrnt/9082178#file-rebootactorsystem-scala-L28).

I have a few thoughts and suggestions on how we might improve the feature a bit still:\r\n\r\n  - Can we get id of the `commons-text` dependency? The fewer dependencies, the fewer possible problems for users due to dependency clashes. It seems a bit heavy to add a new library for just one random string generation.\r\n\r\n  - The feature is configured through additional constructor parameters. I am wondering if we may want to move this to the `Configuration`. That would allow the \"ops side of things\" to configure this for a setup (setting entropy key and checkpoints directory) without needing everyone that writes a Flink program to be aware of this.\r\n\r\n  - If I read the code correctly, the code logs warnings for every file in case the feature is not activated. That will probably confuse a lot of users and make them dig into whether they have a wrong setup, when they simply don't use this new feature.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405106084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405107435","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6326#issuecomment-405107435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6326","id":405107435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTEwNzQzNQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-15T18:00:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-15T18:00:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pushed

If the default value is provided if no option was set.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405200559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405203787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6289#issuecomment-405203787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6289","id":405203787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTIwMzc4Nw==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-16T10:17:44Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T10:17:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll just fix the name while merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405203787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405215352","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6327#issuecomment-405215352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6327","id":405215352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTIxNTM1Mg==","user":{"login":"NicoK","id":213026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK","html_url":"https://github.com/NicoK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-16T11:14:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T11:14:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased and enabled SSL only for already existing e2e tests -

Elasticsearch REST API can have a context root in addition the to list of httpHosts, so I added the ability to have prefixPath, and calling:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final RestClientBuilder builder = RestClient.builder(httpHosts.toArray(new HttpHost[httpHosts.size()]));\r\n\r\n    if (pathPrefix != null && !pathPrefix.isEmpty() && !pathPrefix.equals(\"/\")) {\r\n      builder.setPathPrefix(this.pathPrefix);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that is set on the builder.\r\n\r\n2. Elasticsearch REST can be protected by login/password so I added the ability to set username/password:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  private CredentialsProvider getCredentialProvider() {\r\n    CredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = null;\r\n    if (userConfig.containsKey(CONFIG_KEY_ES_USERNAME) && userConfig.containsKey(CONFIG_KEY_ES_PASSWORD)) {\r\n      credentialsProvider = new BasicCredentialsProvider();\r\n      credentialsProvider.setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY,\r\n          new UsernamePasswordCredentials(userConfig.get(CONFIG_KEY_ES_USERNAME), userConfig.get(CONFIG_KEY_ES_PASSWORD)));\r\n    }\r\n    return credentialsProvider;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nand \r\nthen\r\n```\r\n        builder.setHttpClientConfigCallback(httpClientBuilder ->\r\n            httpClientBuilder\r\n                .setDefaultCredentialsProvider(getCredentialProvider()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore generally it should be easy for the user to change how the builder is configure to make sure people can customize this as they want (like configure SSL...).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405914162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/405916350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6352#issuecomment-405916350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6352","id":405916350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTkxNjM1MA==","user":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-18T12:40:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T12:40:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Interesting.
