One of the advantages I see to it is better isolation for the processor vs. any other NiFi AWS processors.  I'm a bit worried that one PutS3Object processor using SSE-KMS would change the settings other processors running at the same time.  I believe an appropriate location to do this would be in AbstractS3Processor::createClient().  That would allow the configuration code to be shared, while the configured value would remain specific to individual processors.\n\nBut I'm not sure I agree with configuring the version as a true/false setting for signature version 4.  I would recommend a list of values:\n- AWS SDK default (as the default selection)\n- Signature v2\n- Signature v4\n\nThat leaves room for the AWS SDK default to change if/when we upgrade to a newer SDK, and it would allow for users to explicitly request either v4 or v2 to match whatever features and endpoint they are using.  What do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/227340851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/227427914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/252#issuecomment-227427914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/252","id":227427914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzQyNzkxNA==","user":{"login":"jskora","id":181587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora","html_url":"https://github.com/jskora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jskora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T12:43:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T12:43:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hoping to do that today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/227427914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/227434714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/541#issuecomment-227434714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/541","id":227434714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzQzNDcxNA==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T13:11:55Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T13:11:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto let me look at what's going on with 0.x and I'll issue a separate PR.

For now, it should cause a bulletin to happen which does give the user a sense of what is happening generally (and recently).\n\nAnd we should make a JIRA to figure out how to best achieve what joe describes.  We absolutely want a dataflow manager to be able to see what went wrong.  Perhaps we say something as simple as 'we don't index route events' and thus provenance will be ok.  Or maybe we do more.
