You can think they lie on an arc, not considering the shape of the nodes. Because if we wish to make the edge start and end exactly on the border of the node shape, it would be a super complex way to calculate (think about collision detection algorithm).\r\n\r\nSo, I think it is a good idea to keep it this way, and use `symbolOffset` to adjust as you wish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/497226702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/comments/497227668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/10442#issuecomment-497227668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/10442","id":497227668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzIyNzY2OA==","user":{"login":"susiwen8","id":20318608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzE4NjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20318608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8","html_url":"https://github.com/susiwen8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/susiwen8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T07:00:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T07:00:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ovilia I see.
