hello, we prefer use english to discuss issue. we don't care the SQL that hibernate auto generated.

here?\r\n\r\n问题在于：第一，sharding的官网明确说明了【适用于任何基于 JDBC 的 ORM 框架，如：JPA, Hibernate, Mybatis, Spring JDBC Template 或直接使用 JDBC。】其中jpa排在首位，而jpa的save方法是使用率极高的。所以此处你说“we don't care the SQL that hibernate auto generated”我认为有些不妥。\r\n第二，sharding的目的在于实现分库分表，使项目在大数据场景下效率更好，而此处调用save方法却会遍历所有的库进行操作，对于性能肯定是有影响的。\r\n第三，遍历所有的库进行save操作，难道不会产生脏数据吗？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1017241107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1017254156","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14463#issuecomment-1017254156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14463","id":1017254156,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M48ohEM","user":{"login":"maxiaof","id":95011623,"node_id":"U_kgDOBanDJw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95011623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof","html_url":"https://github.com/maxiaof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxiaof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-20T09:02:03Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T09:02:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

But i hava a question.\r\n\r\nFirst, Springboot 2.x not support use `_` , it 's only support `-`, i think this Springboot problem. ShardingSphere maybe needn't to compatible it. I think throws exception is better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1018233659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1018238244","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14975#issuecomment-1018238244","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14975","id":1018238244,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M48sRUk","user":{"login":"strongduanmu","id":10829171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODI5MTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10829171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu","html_url":"https://github.com/strongduanmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strongduanmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T07:05:47Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T07:05:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@wsm12138 Thank you for your feedback, I will investigate this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1018238244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/1018253837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/14978#issuecomment-1018253837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14978","id":1018253837,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M48sVIN","user":{"login":"sandynz","id":42492540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDkyNTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42492540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz","html_url":"https://github.com/sandynz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandynz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-21T07:33:00Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T07:33:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's found in a simple performance test.\r\nTable `sbtest1` with 20 millions lines of records that's generated by sysbench.\r\nScaling job ran on 4G heap JVM.\r\nIt throw exception on inventory dump:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] 2022-01-21 11:58:23.078 [ShardingSphere-Scaling-execute-4] o.a.s.d.p.core.task.InventoryTask - get an error when migrating the inventory data\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded\r\n\tat java.util.LinkedHashMap.newNode(LinkedHashMap.java:256)\r\n\tat java.util.HashMap.putVal(HashMap.java:631)\r\n\tat java.util.HashMap.put(HashMap.java:612)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.driver.executor.batch.BatchExecutionUnit.mapAddBatchCount(BatchExecutionUnit.java:56)\r\n\tat org.apache.shardingsphere.driver.executor.batch.BatchPreparedStatementExecutor.reviseBatchExecutionUnit(BatchPreparedStatementExecutor.java:118)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost memory was consumed by `toBeAckRecords` which is instanceof `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` in `AbstractBitSetChannel`.
