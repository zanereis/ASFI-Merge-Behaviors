data-issue-key=\"STORM-442\"><del>STORM-442</del></a> multilang ShellBolt/ShellSpout die() can be hang when Exception happened</p>\n\n<p>    In ShellBolt, the _readerThread read command from python/shell process, and handle like this:<br/>\n     try<br/>\n     </p>\n{ \nShellMsg shellMsg = _process.readShellMsg(); \n... \n     }\n<p> catch (InterruptedException e) {<br/>\n     } catch (Throwable t) </p>\n{ \ndie(t); \n     }\n\n<p>    And in the die function, getProcessTerminationInfoString will read getErrorsString() from processErrorStream.</p>\n\n<p>    private void die(Throwable exception) </p>\n{ \n String processInfo = _process.getProcessInfoString() + _process.getProcessTerminationInfoString(); \n _exception = new RuntimeException(processInfo, exception); \n    }\n\n<p>    so when ShellBolt got exception(for example, readShellMsg() throw NPE ) , but it is not an error from sub process, then getProcessTerminationInfoString will be hang because processErrorStream have no data to read.</p>\n\n<p>    On the other hand, as Kang Xiao says ShellBolt should fail fast on exception ( <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/46\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/pull/46</a> ) , I think it is not a good idea to read error info from stream.</p>\n\n<p>    Because Kang Xiao 's PR is based old version, so I will move his code to this PR, and modify the same place in ShellSpout.</p>\n\n<p>You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by

How reproducible is the issue?  Does this happen every time the supervisor dies?  Are you using the default even scheduler or is it the isolation scheduler? If it is the isolation scheduler are either of the topologies isolated?  I assume not, because you indicated that multiple topologies were running on the same supervisor.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible for you to share the logs, including the logs for nimbus, the supervisors, and the workers.  Or to share a stripped down version of your topologies that can use to reproduce the issue?</p>\n\n<p>In general storm does not reassign workers when a supervisor goes down, because the supervisor is supposed to be under supervision and be restarted quickly.  Nimbus assumes that any failure there is transient.  However, if a worker fails to heartbeat into nimbus, through zookeeper, for a default timeout of 30 seconds, it will assume that the worker has died and will mark the worker to be rescheduled.  If the supervisor is down at the time this rescheduling happens then nimbus will reschedule the worker on a different node that has a slot free.  If the supervisor is still up when the rescheduling happens or manages to restart in time for nimbus to see it up there is a possibility that the scheduler will place the worker in the same slot it was in before.  There are also lots of corner cases when you have a cluster that is nearly full and enough nodes go down that there are no longer enough slots to run everything.</p>\n\n<p>Just looking at the log lines provided, the only thing that seems to be changing between the assignments is the start time aka when they were reassigned, and two assignments switch places in their order.  Looking at the code the assignment ordering looks like it might be enough to trigger the logs being printed out, but I don't really know for sure.  In either case, both schedulers really only reschedules workers when they think that they are not up and functioning.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612476626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612455660","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/4098#issuecomment-2612455660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/4098","id":2612455660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI0NTU2NjA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T16:09:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T12:49:01Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=revans2\">revans2</a>:</i>\n<p>I believe you that there is a bug in rebalance on large topologies, it is just that storm does not currently do a rebalance the way you have described it, and I honestly don't know if it ever did.  Could you please include the exact version of storm you are using when you saw this issue?</p>\n\n<p>When a topology is rebalanced nimbus keeps the existing assignments the same but marks the topology as needing to be rebalanced.

The issue is a usability one.  Trying to create a NimbusClient or a DRPCClient requires a full cluster config.  If that is true, then we need to provide better APIs to let users do that in a simple way.  Perhaps we can add in a few new Constructors or make the config to getConfiguredClient optional and smarter.

The zookeeper cluster is running across those three machines as well.</p>\n\n<p>I pull the network cable out of sc-alpha-r between 17:15:40 and 17:16:00. Notice that, beforehand, nimbus is still trying to reassign Sync to sc-alpha-r, even though it's running there already (that log file was originally 90MB, filled with those messages)</p>\n\n<p>After 30s, nimbus notices that Async is not running, and reassigns it to sc-beta-r. It still tries to reassign Sync to sc-alpha-r.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in the UI, it now shows the two supervisors still running, but only one slot is being used (two should be used, one for each topology). I've attached the screenshot.</p>\n\n<p>At 17:37:04, I manually rebalance Sync (notice that nimbus thinks that Sync is still up), and it reassigns it to sc-beta-r. But then it continues to reassign to sc-beta-r, and it will continue to do so forever.</p>\n\n\n<p>My guess is that nimbus is getting stuck in a loop, continually trying to reassign the Sync topology, and is so busy doing that that it doesn't notice the worker running Sync has disappeared.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612476637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/51512163","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/36#issuecomment-51512163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/36","id":51512163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTEyMTYz","user":{"login":"xiaokang","id":680838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDgzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/680838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaokang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaokang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T18:29:06Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T18:29:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@d2r , a unit test test-sort-slots is added for sort-slots function.

My only guess is that when you pull the network cable Async gets an error and dies quickly, where as Sync does not and tries to reconnect to zookeeper.
