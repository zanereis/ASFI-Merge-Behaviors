My basic assumption is that hat when applied and follower indices reach a particular point, x, we can safely clean up any zero-copy for write/appendEntries up to x (0-x).  I did that in the Ozone PoC and that works fine. But I'm not sure if it's correct universally for any use-cases.\r\n\r\nI think your suggestion is a better approach. Only concern is that it may lead to a more complex change as we need to pass the `ReferenceCountedObject` from GRPC to raft internal. E.g. for ClientServiceProtocol (appendEntries) we may need to change the `RaftServerAsynchronousProtocol.appendEntriesAsync` because now it only accepts a protobuf object. \r\nAnyway, I think it's viable. And I just saw https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/998 which should help this. Thanks. \r\n\r\nClosed this PR for now. Will submit a new one for the new implementation. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1876500256/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1880034349","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/1004#issuecomment-1880034349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/1004","id":1880034349,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5wDwwt","user":{"login":"huangzhaobo99","id":63718681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzE4Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63718681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99","html_url":"https://github.com/huangzhaobo99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangzhaobo99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-07T11:43:02Z","updated_at":"2024-01-07T11:43:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @szetszwo, Could you kindly help to take a review when you have time, Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1880034349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1881627677","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/1003#issuecomment-1881627677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/1003","id":1881627677,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5wJ1wd","user":{"login":"szetszwo","id":907380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/szetszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-08T18:39:48Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T18:39:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nandakumar131 , thanks a lot for working on this!

 Regarding `TestRaftWithSimulatedRpc`. What happened is:\r\n1. `s2` was the leader of term `2`.\r\n2. `s2` received a client request, added to log as `(t:2, i:1475)`.\r\n3. `s0` received `appendEntries` from `s2` for `(t:2, i:1475)`. A `TransactionContext` is [created](https://github.com/apache/ratis/blob/master/ratis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/server/raftlog/segmented/SegmentedRaftLog.java#L477) for `(t:2, i:1475)` during `appendEntries` (I think this is wrong). \r\n4. `1475` hadn't been replcated to majority of nodes,  `s0` hadn't applied it yet.\r\n5. Leader changed to `s1`. (`s1` hadn't received `appendEntries` for `(t:2, i:1475)`).\r\n6. `s1` received a client request, appended it as `1475`\r\n7. `s1` decreased `s0`'s `nextIndex`: `s1@group-9EAE5FF30820->s0: decreaseNextIndex nextIndex: updateUnconditionally 1475 -> 1474`\r\n8. `s0` received `appendEntries` from `s2` for `(t:2, i:1475)`, it looked up `TransactionContext` and saw one created per 3. Assertion `Preconditions.assertSame(getLogEntry().getTerm(), entry.getTerm(), \"entry.term\");` fails.\r\n\r\nI believe the problem is from the fact that TransactionContext is [created](https://github.com/apache/ratis/blob/master/ratis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/ratis/server/raftlog/segmented/SegmentedRaftLog.java#L477) during `appendEntries`.\r\n\r\n``` \r\n    // in SegmentedRaftLog#appendImpl\r\n     for (int i = index; i < entries.size(); i++) {\r\n        final LogEntryProto entry = entries.get(i);\r\n        futures.add(appendEntry(entry, server.getTransactionContext(entry, true)));\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n`appendEntries` should lookup `TransactionContext` only.\r\n``` \r\n        futures.add(appendEntry(entry, server.getTransactionContext(entry, false)));\r\n```\r\nOr the `term` assertion shouldn't be there. \r\n\r\nLook at the failing test per https://github.com/apache/ratis/actions/runs/7516329635/artifacts/1167720078, `org.apache.ratis.server.simulation.TestRaftWithSimulatedRpc-output.txt`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1894374538/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/1894758227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/1011#issuecomment-1894758227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/1011","id":1894758227,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBMxbGc5w77dT","user":{"login":"szetszwo","id":907380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo","html_url":"https://github.com/szetszwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szetszwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-17T00:54:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T00:54:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Regarding TestRaftWithSimulatedRpc.
