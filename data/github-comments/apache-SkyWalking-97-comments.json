Elasticsearch storage is never designed for small scale case. We change it for improving stability, which if you used the 6.1.0 or before in high payload is very obvious.\r\n1. Downstream is just about dataset size, but it has same write and read frequency. \r\n\r\nThe key of this change is delete impact, which will make elasticsearch crash easier than more indexes. Also, feel free to disable month level downstream, I personally don't think it is necessary, it is there just for keep UI and functions consistently and perfectly for new users","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/508751757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/508755717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3015#issuecomment-508755717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3015","id":508755717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODc1NTcxNw==","user":{"login":"dmsolr","id":29735230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzM1MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29735230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr","html_url":"https://github.com/dmsolr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmsolr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T13:16:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T13:16:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for your comment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/508755717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/508756259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/3006#issuecomment-508756259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/3006","id":508756259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODc1NjI1OQ==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-05T13:19:00Z","updated_at":"2019-07-05T13:19:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"You need to delete all indexes when uograde to 6.2.0.
