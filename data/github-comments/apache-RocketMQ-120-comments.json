Here are the cons and pros when making the decision.\r\n1. As a library, when an API promises to developers that it keeps a timeout duration, it should try its best to keep the promise; For example, if developers invoke `send(message, 1s, cb)`, either cb called within 1s or cb is executed with TimeoutException the moment call get expired.\r\n2. Things get tricky when the internal retry mechanism is involved.  It is too easy to fail the promise now.\r\n3. After studying solutions of other projects, say [gRPC client retry](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md), it is more reasonable to refine the semantics of the timeout in the API as **timeout of the internal RPC** and respect client timeout at the same time.

@15712852007 @lwclover I am the original designer of this scheme. Here are the cons and pros when making the decision.\r\n> \r\n> 1. As a library, when an API promises to developers that it keeps a timeout duration, it should try its best to keep the promise; For example, if developers invoke `send(message, 1s, cb)`, either cb called within 1s or cb is executed with TimeoutException the moment call get expired.\r\n> 2. Things get tricky when the internal retry mechanism is involved.  It is too easy to fail the promise now.\r\n> 3. After studying solutions of other projects, say [gRPC client retry](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md), it is more reasonable to refine the semantics of the timeout in the API as **timeout of the internal RPC** and respect client timeout at the same time.\r\n\r\nI agree with you.\r\n\r\nI've known you for years on QQ. See you again.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1225044097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1225094520","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4838#issuecomment-1225094520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4838","id":1225094520,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85JBXV4","user":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-24T02:19:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T02:19:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Amazing...

The format of the used cache key is `setup-java-${{ platform }}-${{ packageManager }}-${{ fileHash }}`. So the default configuration could not make sure the latest snapshot jar is downloaded. java-setup makes it possible to define the cache key by ourselves, but it seems could not satisfy the needs you mentioned above easily.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, could we assume that there should not be snapshot in master/develop branch?\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n1. https://github.com/actions/setup-java#caching-packages-dependencies\r\n2. https://github.com/actions/setup-java/issues/255","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1225506303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1225528617","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4696#issuecomment-1225528617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4696","id":1225528617,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85JDBUp","user":{"login":"echooymxq","id":19860963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODYwOTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19860963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq","html_url":"https://github.com/echooymxq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echooymxq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-24T10:26:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T10:26:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\n> > \r\n> \r\n> 现在已经feature freeze了，正在做全面的故障注入测试跟回归测试，预计本周会发起发布的discuss，有兴趣的话可以一起参与到测试当中。\r\n\r\n故障注入测试这块依赖什么来做？对这块比较感兴趣。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1225528617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1225578809","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4881#issuecomment-1225578809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4881","id":1225578809,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85JDNk5","user":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-24T11:14:56Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T11:14:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@15712852007 1, The synchronous path shall also be updated;

\r\n\r\nActually, 2 is practically the number Google takes internally. Here is reason they give\r\n\r\n> In practice, most code reviews that require more than one approval usually go through a two-step process: gaining an LGTM from a peer engineer, and then seeking approval from appropriate code owner/readability reviewer(s). This allows the two roles to focus on different aspects of the code review and saves review time. The primary reviewer can focus on code correctness and the general validity of the code change; the code owner can focus on whether this change is appropriate for their part of the codebase without having to focus on the details of each line of code. An approver is often looking for something different than a peer reviewer, in other words. After all, someone is trying to check in code to their project/directory. They are more concerned with questions such as: “Will this code be easy or difficult to maintain?” “Does it add to my technical debt?” “Do we have the expertise to maintain it within our team?”\r\n\r\n> If all three of these types of reviews can be handled by one reviewer, why not just have those types of reviewers handle all code reviews? The short answer is scale. Separating the three roles adds flexibility to the code review process. If you are working with a peer on a new function within a utility library, you can get someone on your team to review the code for code correctness and comprehension. After several rounds (perhaps over several days), your code satisfies your peer reviewer and you get an LGTM. Now, you need only get an owner of the library (and owners often have appropriate readability) to approve the change. \r\n\r\nSee https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch09.html#code_review-id00002\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1229675485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1229678619","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3207#issuecomment-1229678619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3207","id":1229678619,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85JS2gb","user":{"login":"lanlanbaby","id":56666543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjY2NTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56666543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby","html_url":"https://github.com/lanlanbaby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanlanbaby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T02:31:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T02:31:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> You can use openmessage-benchmark to achieve the same effect, because a very simple producer example suffices for this test\r\n\r\n@guyinyou Thank your recommendation, i just want to know where the script is, because this script looks very convenient and easy to use, it was written by yourselves?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1229678619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1229679738","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4635#issuecomment-1229679738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4635","id":1229679738,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85JS2x6","user":{"login":"PansonPanson","id":16064908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0OTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16064908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson","html_url":"https://github.com/PansonPanson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PansonPanson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T02:34:08Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T02:34:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lizhanhui I just merged  develop into the current branch, but tests failed.
