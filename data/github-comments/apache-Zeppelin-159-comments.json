In addition if I enter username and password which is registered in Keycloak I get an exception:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.shiro.authc.pam.UnsupportedTokenException: Realm [io.buji.pac4j.realm.Pac4jRealm@5e7a3fcc] does not support authentication token [org.apache.shiro.authc.UsernamePasswordToken - sarunas, rememberMe=false].  Please ensure that the appropriate Realm implementation is configured correctly or that the realm accepts AuthenticationTokens of this type.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) If I comment `/** = authc` in [urls] section out, nothing happens as Zeppelin's main screen is loaded without any authentication nor transferring to Keycloak... and it is supposed as to be-no auth required.\r\n\r\nMy shiro.ini example:\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Click to expand</summary>\r\n<p><pre>\r\n[main]\r\nsecurityManager.realms = $pac4jRealm\r\noidcConfig = org.pac4j.oidc.config.OidcConfiguration\r\noidcConfig.discoveryURI = http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo/.well-known/openid-configuration\r\noidcConfig.clientId = zeppelin\r\noidcConfig.secret = 1baabe32-50bc-49c4-9ac3-a303a9f953c5\r\noidcConfig.clientAuthenticationMethodAsString = client_secret_basic\r\noidcClient = org.pac4j.oidc.client.OidcClient\r\noidcClient.configuration = $oidcConfig\r\nclients = org.pac4j.core.client.Clients\r\nclients.callbackUrl = http://localhost:8082/api/callback\r\nclients.clients = $oidcClient\r\nrequireRoleAdmin = org.pac4j.core.authorization.authorizer.RequireAnyRoleAuthorizer\r\n#requireRoleAdmin.elements = zeppelin_group\r\nconfig = org.pac4j.core.config.Config\r\nconfig.clients = $clients\r\n#config.authorizers = admin:$requireRoleAdmin\r\npac4jRealm = io.buji.pac4j.realm.Pac4jRealm\r\npac4jSubjectFactory = io.buji.pac4j.subject.Pac4jSubjectFactory\r\nsecurityManager.subjectFactory = $pac4jSubjectFactory\r\noidcSecurityFilter = io.buji.pac4j.filter.SecurityFilter\r\noidcSecurityFilter.config = $config\r\noidcSecurityFilter.clients = oidcClient<br>\r\ncallbackFilter = io.buji.pac4j.filter.CallbackFilter\r\ncallbackFilter.defaultUrl = http://localhost:8082\r\ncallbackFilter.config = $config\r\nsessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager<br>\r\n[urls]\r\n/api/callback = callbackFilter\r\n#/** = anon\r\n/** = authc\r\n\r\n</pre></p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\nSo:\r\n - Has anyone managed to get Zeppelin integrated with e.g. Keycloak by means of shiro + pac4j oidc ?\r\n - Can anyone share example of their shiro.ini file if so ?\r\n - Is my understanding then correct that changes from this pull request are not enough for getting Zeppelin->pac4j-oidc->Keycloak mix working, we need some code adjustments in zeppelin-web project?

All,\r\n\r\nHave one more question related to OIDC enablement on Zeppelin. I am now able successfully authenticate my user and log into Zeppelin app by Shiro, OIDC and Keycloak, but unfortunately I am not able to log out. It loops when I click on Logout button keeping my user being logged in with the initial token id, and does not direct me to Keycloak for another login attempt. \r\nThe scenario is:\r\n\r\n1) I hit default Zeppelin URL and then I am transferred to Keycloak for user credentials.\r\n2) I authenticate by user name and password so am logged into Zeppelin.\r\n3) I click on \"Logout\" button within Zeppelin app once I am there, then \"Logout success\" dialog box appears, and I am redirected to main Zeppelin screen.\r\n`baseUrlSrv.getRestApiBase() + '/login/logout'` followed by `window.location = baseUrlSrv.getBase()` from **navbar.controller.js**\r\n4) Once I am redirected to main page, default url is triggered and my user is logged in again without any promt for credentials because of stored token.\r\n\r\nI also added a few lines into shiro.ini file just to try, which I thought might help but looks it has no effect.\r\n```\r\n[main]\r\nlogout.redirectUrl=http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/logout\r\n\r\n[urls]\r\n/api/login/logout = logout\r\n```\r\nCurrently I am trying to solve this logout issue (to get actually logged out & directed to Keycloack for authentication with e.g. another user credentials...) and find a solution, but maybe someone already did that ? \r\nAny tips on how to log out from Zeppelin with or without code modifications would be very welcome
