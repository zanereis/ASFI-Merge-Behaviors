It would be great to rebase it.\r\n\r\nHere is what I noted based on our discussion earlier:\r\n- We want an ability to avoid combining tasks across particular partition columns in our `Scan` API.\r\n- We do NOT want a table property as the config does not really belong there and it would affect other engines.\r\n- We want Spark to propagate join attributes in the future. Until then, we should have a reasonable default behavior.\r\n\r\nI think it is reasonable to not combine files across partitions for partitioned tables by default in Spark, hoping we can benefit from storage-partitioned joins. However, I worry the new behavior may cause performance regressions in some cases as we will generate more splits (even though we may not benefit from any join optimizations). Do we want to expose a way to force combining files across partitions (i.e. old behavior)? There are two ways to support that: either add a read option in Iceberg or try checking if storage-partitioned joins are enabled in Spark SQL (if not, we can safely combine). Since Spark will pass join attributes in the future, adding a read option does not seem preferable.

When the file is missing, Spark/Hadoop fallback to \"listing\" all the `*.metadata.json` files. You can see where the \"warning\" for missing version-hint is caught here and how it falls through to attempting to list here: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/dbb8a404f6632a55acb36e949f0e7b84b643cede/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/hadoop/HadoopTableOperations.java#L325\r\n\r\nAs long as your `v*.metadata.json` filenames follow that naming convention of being monotonically increasing and fit in an int, the file-listing approach technically works **in the absence of concurrent attempted writes from other engines**. If you have tons (i.e., many thousands) of versioned metadata files in the metadata directories, this will be slow.\r\n\r\nIf you do need to worry about transactionality with lots of writers trying to \"commit\" new metadata.json files, you at the very least need those writers to correctly populate `version-hint.text` to serve as an \"atomic commit\" of the correct write.\r\n\r\nMost ideally, you'd use another Catalog implementation -- one of the main reasons for having separate Catalog implementations is precisely to overcome the shortcomings of the default HadoopCatalog-based approach.\r\n\r\nWhat system were you using to write the Iceberg tables in the first

Does this mean that the only way to create a sorted Iceberg table (without buckets) is to create it non-sorted, and then apply \"WRITE ... ORDERED BY\" ?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are creating the table with the Java API - not through Spark - with the desired sorting spec, and then writing the DataFrame to the existing, empty table. I'd like to avoid interacting with Iceberg API directly, but the other option (CTAS and then WRITE ORDERED BY) results in 2 Spark jobs. @kbendick I'd really appreciate you opinion on that :D

The current ScanContext, which lumps configuration items and parsing together, is bloated.\r\n2. Even when it comes to parsing the configuration, ScanContext doesn't seem to do a good enough job. Currently, there is no unified way to parse these configuration: 1. The source and priority of each configuration is clearly defined in `Flink Read Conf`, which tells us whether the configuration can come from `Table Properties`, `Session`, or `Options`, which is not done in `ScanContext`. 2. At the same time, its parsing is incomplete. The `fromProperties(Map<String, String> properties)` of ScanContext creates a new `Configuration`, which ignores the value set by the `Set k=v` in flink Session. In our use, The `Set` does not take effect.  \r\n3. We support many available configurations, but they are not described in the documentation. I think this is bad for users. This makes the user think we're missing functionality.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote this code, I considered removing `ScanContext` to fully align to `Flink Read Conf`, which would bring it exactly in line with the style of Flik Sink.\r\n\r\nWhat's your opinion? Look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1277151870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1277160689","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5951#issuecomment-1277160689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5951","id":1277160689,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MH-zx","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-13T07:33:29Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T07:33:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> is this supported in flink already?\r\n\r\nyes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1277160689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1277161614","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/5281#issuecomment-1277161614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/5281","id":1277161614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85MH_CO","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-13T07:34:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T07:34:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could you please take a look when you are avaliable?
