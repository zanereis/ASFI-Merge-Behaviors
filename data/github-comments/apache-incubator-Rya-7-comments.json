this is a case where a few different schema terms (rdfs:subClassOf, owl:unionOf, and eventually owl:equivalentClass) end up being represented by just one term internally (subclass/superclass relationships). We could plausibly organize by either; my intuition is to use the internal representation, since the internal graph being complete and accurate can matter to the other rules. That would mean pulling the logic introduced here, plus the logic introduced in [PR 184](https://github.com/apache/incubator-rya/pull/184) , plus the logic for rdfs:subClassOf (which 184 incidentally simplifies to a method call anyway) into some \"refreshSubClassGraph\" method. Thoughts on that approach?
