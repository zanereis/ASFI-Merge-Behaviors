Since we are talking about adding a new public API, I think having a pair of sync and async method is a good practice of adding a new method into a client. because introducing a sync method without an async method is inconsistent with other methods which can confuse the users. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is no guarantee on \"acknowledge\". But we are going to change this behavior for transaction support. We should potentially include that for adding this new method. Otherwise, it is going to be hard to maintain once this API is exposed publicly.
