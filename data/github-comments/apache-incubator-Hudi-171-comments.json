So the data from the kafka topic is pulled into hive for a bit (in the default db), the SQL transformation is performed, and then the data is written according to the target schema.\r\nThis means we need to make sure that the user that is running the job has all permissions to access the hive metastore's default db as this is where he will temporarily register this <SRC> table, which in reality wil be called \"HOODIE_SRC_TMP_TABLE_some_random_number\".\r\n2)WITHOUT SQL TRANSFORMATION\r\nWhile if you dont do any sql transformation, the data is directly landed in the target table and target db specified in the props.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/971693314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/971782526","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3486#issuecomment-971782526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3486","id":971782526,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM457Dl-","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T17:09:48Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T17:09:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@zhedoubushishi : thanks for the contribution! good job.

also having the same type of issue in EMR 6.4 after building and deploying Hudi 0.9.0. Note that as mentioned [above](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2498#issuecomment-969228521), the default binaries work just fine (EMR 6.4 with Hudi 0.8.0).\r\n\r\nIt seems that there's likely something off with the build or referencing. I used `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dspark3 -Dscala-2.12 -T 30`.\r\n\r\nWhat's really interesting is that I can create an MoR table w/o issue, but trying to do a `load` renders the loaded DF unusable. It looks like the DF is loaded, but then becomes unusable.\r\n\r\nThis [tip](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2498#issuecomment-942282671) also worked for me (i.e. using `spark.sql` and referencing the table from the Glue data catalog). Unfortunately, querying the data this way seems to be *much* slower (compared to 0.8.0).\r\n\r\nI documented my build and installation process in [this](https://apache-hudi.slack.com/archives/C4D716NPQ/p1637354714476100) slack thread.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI tested this with a CoW table and I did not have the issue, i.e. the following works just fine. It did; however, take 2.7x longer to do the read than it did in 0.8.0.\r\n````\r\ndf = spark.read.format(\"org.apache.hudi\").load(path)\r\ndf.show()\r\n````","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/974507962/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/974517577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3968#issuecomment-974517577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3968","id":974517577,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM46FfVJ","user":{"login":"manojpec","id":3233255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3233255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec","html_url":"https://github.com/manojpec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manojpec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-19T22:35:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T22:35:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nsivabalan \r\n\r\nCI Passed\r\nInteg test run succeeded -
