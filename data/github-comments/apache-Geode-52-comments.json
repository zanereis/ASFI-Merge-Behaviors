A few small changes to clean up the code a bit. I also notice that there are several DUnit test failures associated with this change (more than we would expect just due to the known flakiness of some WAN DUnit tests) so I would prefer not to merge this change until they have been diagnosed and remedied.\r\n> \r\n> Also, while it's not strictly within the scope of this PR, I notice that in `WANTestBase.createSender()` line 1747, the call to `gateway.create(dsName, remoteDsId);` comes before the call to `gateway.setBatchTimeInterval(batchTimeInterval);` which means the second call has no effect on the batch time interval. If fixing this has no effect on existing tests, then it would be okay to include it as part of this PR, I think. If fixing it causes tests to start failing, a separate JIRA ticket should be created to address the changes.\r\n\r\n@DonalEvans Thanks a lot for your comments. You have an incredible eye to find every error and identify items to improve.\r\n- I have added a fix for the distributed tests that were failing.\r\n- I have incorporated all the fixes you have suggested in your comments.\r\n- I have also tackled the issue you mentioned regarding `WANTestBase.createSender()` when specifying a `batchTimeInterval`. The way to address it has been to remove the parameter from the method as it had no effect anyway. I think it was me the one who introduced it in the first place when I implemented the \"GEODE-7971\" and was trying to fix some flaky tests. But obviously, that parameter did not have anything to do to the fix of the test cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/681917316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/682198563","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5484#issuecomment-682198563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5484","id":682198563,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjE5ODU2Mw==","user":{"login":"lgtm-com[bot]","id":43144390,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDMxNDQzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/17324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lgtm-com","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgtm-com%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-27T21:23:43Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T21:23:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This pull request **fixes 1 alert** when merging cb5386cd80221e2f3be30c2317381e047dcc5dc6 into 0c2a8a3f2cc7d57cc7ddfd47944aa0fecb4f6655 - [view on LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/geode/rev/pr-dc15ab885bb087dbb4e714b76ad1a7348cf90861)\n\n**fixed alerts:**\n\n* 1 for Implicit conversion from array to string","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/682198563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/682255954","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5480#issuecomment-682255954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5480","id":682255954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjI1NTk1NA==","user":{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-28T00:21:04Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T00:21:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Testing…\r\n\r\n1. `./gradlew build -PproductName=\"GemFire\" -PgeodeVersion=1.14.0-build.0 -Pversion=1.14.0-build.0 -PbuildId=0 -x test` generates `GemFireVersion.properties` with timestamp\r\n2. running same command again does not modify that file\r\n3. running `./gradlew build -PproductName=\"GemFire\" -PgeodeVersion=1.15.0-build.0 -Pversion=1.15.0-build.0 -PbuildId=0 -x test` causes `GemFireVersion.properties` to be modified.

so when two locators are starting up simultaneously I suppose `locatorClient.requestToServer()` is throwing `IOException` (because some other locator on `locators` list hasn't started yet.)\r\n\r\nYour comments imply that starting two locators at once is \"normal\". [Looking at the docs](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/12/configuring/running/starting_up_shutting_down.html), I suppose it is, provided you specify `locator-wait-time` (so as to avoid split-brain.) \r\n\r\nOddly, the docs mention:\r\n\r\n> …an info-level message\r\n> \r\n>     GemFire startup was unable to contact a locator. Waiting for one to start. Configured locators are frodo[12345],pippin[12345].\r\n\r\nI don't find that message text anywhere in the Geode source today (searched for \"unable to contact a locator\" and \"Configured locators are\"). It makes me think that the docs might talking about (an old version) of the very message that this PR is changing (from info level down to debug level.)

That changed fairly recently.\r\n\r\nIt's still safe to start up multiple locators that all refer to each other without locator-wait-time - provided they can actually reach each other on startup! We have had some issues in K8s environments because there is race between when a locator tries to contact another locator and when the K8s DNS makes the locator name available.\r\n\r\nGood catch on those docs! Yeah, I don't see that string in the products since jgroups was removed in 2015.\r\n\r\nThis particular log message *used* to be `debug` - you and I flipped it to info in this change - 53f1e1a81c3b58989a835d37f94466eb3dfc752f. I don't mind it being an info message - but I think we shouldn't be logging a stack trace in that case. Maybe just an info message that we failed to contact a particular locator. Let me know if you'd like me to make that change. Either way, I'll create a separate docs PR after we have this figured out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/698644756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/698654480","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5545#issuecomment-698654480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5545","id":698654480,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODY1NDQ4MA==","user":{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-25T00:26:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T00:26:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@upthewaterspout would this be an improvement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n          logger.info(\"Unable to contact a locator: \" + problem.getMessage());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way we pass along the content of the exception but do not print a stack trace.

First was the serialization of the session to disk, which really only made sense in peer mode since in client server the persistence is off JVM already. In peer mode it makes more sense, and is more tested, to use region persistence to achieve this hot deployment behavior. The second thing going on was the removal from the local region. This was to avoid class loader casting issues. This was just simplified to a local clear operation rather than iterating over all the sessions specific to this web context. The upside is that it takes a lot less time and doesn't invoke any queries. The downside is that other web contexts will have to refresh their local caches too but this scenario should be very small.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/700840958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/700892050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5552#issuecomment-700892050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5552","id":700892050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDg5MjA1MA==","user":{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-29T18:15:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T18:15:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

I read the documentation you provided in `geode-docs/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/create.html.md.erb` and I'm working on a few grammatical changes. But before I submit them, I would like to better understand the name of the property you propose, `--receivers-sharing-ip-and-port`, and the part of the explanation that says \"Sets whether or not the receivers are sharing the same ip and port.\"\r\nIf I understand the RFC correctly, the general context is an environment in which multiple receivers specify a duplicate ip:port combination (not exactly 'sharing'), and the purpose of the property is to say to gfsh, \"When you create this sender, be sure that all of its dispatcher threads connect to the same receiver.\"\r\nAlso, it sounds like this option would work (though it would be unnecessary) if there was only one receiver up and running.\r\nSo I think this property needs a more precise name. Something like `--enforce-all-threads-same-receiver` or something like that.\r\n[This became very long.

RFC.]","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/704612068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/704730098","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5567#issuecomment-704730098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5567","id":704730098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDczMDA5OA==","user":{"login":"mivanac","id":48509724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTA5NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48509724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac","html_url":"https://github.com/mivanac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mivanac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-07T06:42:00Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T06:42:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Test
