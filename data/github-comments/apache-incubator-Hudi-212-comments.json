Lets say multi-writer is enabled and hence rollbacks are lazy. there is a commit C5 which got committed to MDT, but crashed before committing to data table. and the user restarts the pipeline. due to multi-writer, there are more commits added, but rollback will be triggered lazily by cleaner. Lets say cleaner configs are very easy (say 100 commits). So, by this time, archival could clean up the partially failed commit.\r\n> \r\n> Can we disable lazy cleaner for restarts/bootstrap then ? The lazy cleaning makes sense for normal commit but it just make things complex for boostrap/restarts and it even does not gains much.\r\n\r\nFor multi-writer scenario, we must have lazy cleaning since the job cannot tell if the inflight commit is due to failed write or actual inflight commit from another writer.  So the job relies on the heartbeat timeout for determining the failed writes and lazily cleans up failed commits later. This is the whole point of having the guard we are discussing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1063758898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/1063762822","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4966#issuecomment-1063762822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4966","id":1063762822,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM4_Z7uG","user":{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-10T07:56:58Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T07:56:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @scxwhite rebase this pr.
