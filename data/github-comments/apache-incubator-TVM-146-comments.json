The design options are:\r\n\r\n1. Build an external.so file using `system(\"g++ ...)` like we've done before, load it back and import to the DSO module. The drawback is that we will have that external.so file in the disk.\r\n\r\n2. Invoke Clang frontend APIs to first compile the generated external code to LLVM IR, and then use `llvm::parseIR` like TVM LLVM backend to get an executable module. The uncertain part for this option is that we have no idea about how to accept compile flags from users.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know which option do you prefer or you have a better solution.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/558389025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/558391191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4258#issuecomment-558391191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4258","id":558391191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODM5MTE5MQ==","user":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T23:40:17Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T23:40:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The problem we have right now is to let the DSOModule (in graph runtime) find a symbol from the imported CSourceModule and execute it.

I was thinking this for a while, besides the reasons in the pr description above, some of the other reasons are as following:\r\n\r\n- Having a single op `crop_and_resize`, we don't crop the input and then resize sequentially. `crop_and_resize` directly resizes the input with target size. However, if crop first, then resize, it has to iterate through input images twice, which would introduce some overhead, I guess it is one of the important reasons why TF has crop_and_resize.\r\n\r\n-  \"Crop and then Resize\" is not able to handle interpolation with `extrapolation_value > 0` (sorry TF has this), the extrapolation_value is related to boxes, original image height and width, that means we have to change `resize` to take some extra inputs like boxes and original (NOT the cropped) image height and width, seems it is not simple/clean.

Thank you for your reply! I am very ignorant in this field, and super interested in learning more. Would you mind suggesting better ideas if you have time?\r\n\r\n**Definition(?).** I was thinking, lambda lifting should be a pass that eliminates free variables and lifting lambdas to global scope. Like what is described in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting).\r\n\r\n**Simplest case.** If a lambda can be converted is only used inside relay.call, then it is safe to lift it to a tuple (global_var_lifted, captured_0, captured_1, ...). Mutual recursion works in this case as well.\r\n\r\n**More complicated case.** However, in the general case, when lambda is first-class supported (like relay), it could be hard to lift them, because when adjusting call sites, type mismatch could happen (consider conditionally bind 2 lambdas to a variable, which might capture different things).\r\n\r\n**Your suggestion.** As you suggested, in this case, make a \"global function returning that closure can be used to implement returning closure.\" This is one of the solution that I was thinking before. It works, but I am not sure if it really helps (because closure still exists).\r\n\r\n**What Wikipedia says.** In the section \"algorithm\", it says:\r\n> If the language has closures as first-class objects that can be passed as arguments or returned from other functions, the closure will need to be represented by a data structure that captures the bindings of the free variables.\r\n\r\n**Why I ask this** If we are able to eliminate those lambdas, to \"some data structure\", then we are able to do autodiff without reference...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/559210724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/559210922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2623#issuecomment-559210922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2623","id":559210922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTIxMDkyMg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T18:53:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T18:53:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Move

DL compiler require many expertise and we are all ignorant in different things.\r\nI should answer the general problem before the specific problem.\r\nBut before we start, in general, closure is the \"killer\" of ad. Some ad work do not support closure, like tangent or tensorflow-for-swift. Some work support it, but take lots of effort - Lambda The Ultimate BackPropagator and differentiate through a curry (by author of tf for swift) come to mind. Additionally, all work need some additional bookkeeping for captured value inside the closure, in order to backprop correctly to them. (If we do not use reference, the caller of a lambda must update the reference itself.) Some people use reflection, and some people use some dynamic typing and cast. Reference is a very lightweight bookkeeping technique while making stuff good for other optimization (Reflection will be a much bigger problem for opt/codegen then ref).\r\n\r\n### How to do autodiff of lambda with minimal amount of reference?\r\nThe method of turning lambdas into datastructure is well known and it is called defunctionalization. Basically, it try to make a new datatype, Func, where every single constructor is a \"lambda\" in the AST, and the constructor take in the closure number.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the AST contain the following lambda, all taking two int and returning int\r\n(fun _ _ -> a),\r\n(fun a b -> a * a + b * b)\r\n(fun a b -> a + b + c)\r\n(fun a b -> f (f a b) (f b a))\r\nthe following adt will be declared:\r\ntype FUN =\r\n|  CONST of int\r\n|  AddSquare\r\n|  AddThree of int\r\n|  Point of FUN.\r\nThere is some issue regarding making it type safe, but I imagine we can get by by using some cast here and there.\r\n\r\nwe can then turn some adt containing reference into reference of pure adt. After that we can then do store passing style to that single reference. But I do not think that we can in general remove it (I had tried like 10 times).\r\n\r\nOff a side note, why are you so eager to remove reference? I need to write paper and I think this is a good paper story.\r\n\r\nI will talk about lambda lifting below, but I think we should not mix up lambda lifting with defunctionalization.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/559238842/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/559240254","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4318#issuecomment-559240254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4318","id":559240254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTI0MDI1NA==","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T20:27:19Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T20:27:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmmm, is the reason you want to re-tune schedules to cover cases where output pad = `(1,1)`?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/559240254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/559241524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/4318#issuecomment-559241524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4318","id":559241524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTI0MTUyNA==","user":{"login":"abergeron","id":1002504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron","html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-27T20:31:46Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T20:36:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I forgot the tophub.py file update because I thought it was in your branch.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I don't really need to retune anything, then I would rather save the time.
