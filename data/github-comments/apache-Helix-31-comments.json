Because Helix code has been using String.format at many places and so if we can estimate the improvements, then we can further optimize.\r\n> \r\n> thanks, komal\r\n\r\nHi @desaikomal, I can't get you numbers from a Pinot cluster because I would need to back port these changes to 0.9.x to set it up; I'm hoping we can reap a performance improvement once the upgrade is done. I'm working on experience in Java performance optimisation and I can promise each one of these changes is a \"sure thing.\" Replacing `containsKey`/`get` with `computeIfAbsent` intuitively halves the work, hashing without calling `toString` is also intuitively cheaper.\r\n\r\nHowever, `String.format` would indeed be a rich seam for Helix engineers to work on, so it's worth sharing some representative numbers:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@State(Scope.Benchmark)\r\npublic class BenchmarkStringFormat {\r\n\r\n  public static final String RESOURCE_DN_KEY = \"resourceName\";\r\n  static final String INSTANCE_DN_KEY = \"instanceName\";\r\n  public static final String CLUSTER_DN_KEY = \"cluster\";\r\n\r\n  @Param(\"resource1234\")\r\n  String _resourceName;\r\n  @Param(\"instance1234\")\r\n  String _instanceName;\r\n  @Param(\"cluster1234\")\r\n  String _clusterName;\r\n\r\n  @Benchmark\r\n  public String format() {\r\n    return String.format(\"%s=%s,%s=%s,%s=%s\", CLUSTER_DN_KEY, _clusterName, INSTANCE_DN_KEY, _instanceName,\r\n        RESOURCE_DN_KEY, _resourceName);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Benchmark\r\n  public String concat() {\r\n    return CLUSTER_DN_KEY + \"=\" + _clusterName + \",\"\r\n        + INSTANCE_DN_KEY + \"=\" + _instanceName + \",\"\r\n        + RESOURCE_DN_KEY + \"=\" + _resourceName;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJDK11, my MacBook Pro, no attempt made to control noise:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                     (_clusterName)  (_instanceName)  (_resourceName)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nBenchmarkStringFormat.concat     cluster1234     instance1234     resource1234  avgt    5    35.098 ±  3.046  ns/op\r\nBenchmarkStringFormat.format     cluster1234     instance1234     resource1234  avgt    5  1263.995 ± 69.025  ns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nString concatenation, when all the arguments are known statically, is actually very efficient on recent JVMs - compiling to JDK7-JDK8 bytecode levels would generate the equivalent `StringBuilder` calls, from JDK9 onwards an `invokedynamic` instruction is generated, which leads to generation of specialised concatenation code at runtime. On the other hand, it's very difficult for JDK engineers to optimise `String.format` without breaking API compatibility. Though it has got a little faster on JDK17, removing `String.format` where concatenation or `StringBuilder` can be used would save a lot of money at scale.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1137543675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1137553443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2118#issuecomment-1137553443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2118","id":1137553443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5DzbAj","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-25T16:56:16Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T16:56:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @richardstartin  - very helpful and great learnings.

A general question: can we just make the tests sequential? IMO has different system properties are necessary for a better test coverage.\r\n\r\nThis is a good point. I realized the tests are indeed being executed sequentially. However, different methods from different classes can be interleaved, e.g., not all tests from the class A finish before tests from class B start. It could be that some tests from class A run, then some from class B, and so on. This caused the test failure, and so I updated the property and the beginning and end of every method that needs it. Now the tests succeed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1144040915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1144054459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2087#issuecomment-1144054459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2087","id":1144054459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc5EMOK7","user":{"login":"micahstubbs","id":2119400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTk0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2119400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs","html_url":"https://github.com/micahstubbs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/micahstubbs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-01T19:35:41Z","updated_at":"2022-06-01T19:35:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This
