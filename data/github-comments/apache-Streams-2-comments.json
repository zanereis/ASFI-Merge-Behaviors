Ryan,\n\nSteve Blackmon wrote to the list saying that I should clean the metadata using a mvn clean install -U\nThis solved the problem. I also wrote the list saying that this resolved the issue and closed the JIRA issue. However, I still have doubts why this pom has this entry but I wrote that to the list as well. Maybe you could help me improving my maven knowledge by shedding some light on this?\nThanks Ryan!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/55086912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/comments/55087970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/streams/pull/81#issuecomment-55087970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/streams/issues/81","id":55087970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDg3OTcw","user":{"login":"renato2099","id":1325916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjU5MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1325916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099","html_url":"https://github.com/renato2099","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renato2099/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-10T08:55:49Z","updated_at":"2014-09-10T08:55:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\nBut @steveblackmon  could you explain the reasoning behind the renaming of TwitterStreamConfigurator to TwitterConfigurator?
