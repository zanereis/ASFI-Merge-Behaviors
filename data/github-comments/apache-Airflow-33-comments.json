I don't know if it's the same issue but something similar was happening to me a few months ago -- I took a stab at it in https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/569 but it was too slippery to lock down. I think the error message you're seeing is an attempt to alert you that it's happening.\n\nIn my case, Celery tasks were failing for non-airflow reasons (out of memory errors due to many simultaneous tasks in a complex subdag). The celery task would therefore be \"complete\" (as it terminated) but the airflow task would be running and never get updated (since the Celery post-task stuff never runs). It's been a few months since I looked at this but as a starting point, my suggestion is to see if you can diagnose any errors that would be killing the celery workers. I will try to think if there's a way to better self-correct this within

How about when you clear a task, it clears any XComs that it created _which have the same execution date as the cleared task_? Then I would support that being on by default. In the above example, the XCom data pushed on March 19 would disappear but the March 18 data would still be available.

For example, you might want to run different pig operators in different mapreduce queues. If you think there's value in exposing `env` in the `kwargs` to `PigOperator`, we should consider exposing `pig_properties` as well.\n\nRegarding global defaults, we run airflow on a massive hadoop deployment, and changing cluster defaults is not really an option. The folks that maintain pig set default heap space very high (2GB) to account for extreme cases where users would otherwise run out of memory. Our environment is a lot more controlled, and we want to try and optimize memory usage for all `PigCliOperators`, but having a task level value is still probably a good
