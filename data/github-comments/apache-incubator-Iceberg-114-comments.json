How can other sinks ensure the processing ordering?\r\n\r\nThe `JdbcDynamicTableSink` and `KafkaDynamicSink` will return `OutputFormatProvider` and `SinkFunctionProvider` as `SinkRuntimeProvider`. These `SinkRuntimeProvider` will accept `OutputFormat` or `SinkFunction` and append sink operator to upstream directly. So there is no `Filter` operator between upstream and sink operator. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the other sinks haven't the Disorder problem. But Iceberg FlinkSink need accept upstream DataStream and append writer, commiter operators to it instead of a single sink operator. So we cann't use the `OutputFormatProvider` and `SinkFunctionProvider` API to avoid the `Filter` operator added between upstream and FlinkSink.\r\n\r\n But Fortunately, I think we could ignore the Disorder problem for FlinkSQL. Because with the upgrade of flink to 1.13(https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2558), The `CommonPhysicalSink` has been remove and refactor to `CommonExecSink`. We can found the `Filter` operator parallelism will be set to be the same as its upstream. So I think we can no longer modify the `Filter` operator parallelism, and resolve the Disorder problem by upgrade flink to 1.13.\r\n\r\nPS: https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/5f007ff6c8224c6e5a14de2c79296eb85a22fe1f/flink-table/flink-table-planner-blink/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/planner/plan/nodes/exec/common/CommonExecSink.java#L211","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/926804817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/926810888","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3099#issuecomment-926810888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3099","id":926810888,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843PgMI","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-24T17:44:07Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T17:44:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for the review guys.

In 1.12, this method is not deprecated and has already been used in current iceberg master code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/927242283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/927243226","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3067#issuecomment-927243226","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3067","id":927243226,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843RJva","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T06:31:48Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T06:31:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xingbowu ,  Could you please file new issues for the above comment ([1], [2], [3]) and put them in this project dashboard , so that we could easily track the whole progress  ? \r\n\r\nI plan to get this PR merged once we've tracked those issues and fixed the other minor comments, thanks for the work !\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3067#discussion_r703249976\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3067#discussion_r703261388\r\n[3] https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3067#discussion_r711561677","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/927243226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/927246114","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3116#issuecomment-927246114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3116","id":927246114,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843RKci","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T06:57:29Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T06:57:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Okay,   so does any other problems for guaranteeing compatibility for both flink 1.12  & flink 1.13 in your own context ?

Why are there multiple classloaders here and why do they both have copies of `Catalog`?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/927340358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/927385996","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3078#issuecomment-927385996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3078","id":927385996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843RsmM","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T22:53:54Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T22:53:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Since it's been a few days and both Jack and I are +1, I'm going to go ahead and merge this.

I think this issue was introduced from this [apache flink PR](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/15316/files#diff-bd276ed951054125b39428ee61de103d9c7832246398f01514a574bb8e51757cR74) and [FLINK-21913](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21913),  it just changed the returned data type from `CatalogTable` to `ResolvedCatalogTable` without any compatibility guarantee.  In this case,  the iceberg-flink-runtime jar which is compiled from apache flink 1.13 will include the `ResovledCatalogTable` class inside it.  Finally when we   package this jar and submit the flink job to flink 1.12,  the above compatibility issue happen.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, the [DynamicTableFactory](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/99c2a415e9eeefafacf70762b6f54070f7911ceb/flink-table/flink-table-common/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/table/factories/DynamicTableFactory.java) is a basic API which almost all flink connectors are built on top of it.  The breaking compatibility makes the downstream projects really hard to deliver better compatibility to users, unless we iceberg maintain different modules for each maintained flink version (That's not the thing that we want to do).   \r\n\r\nThe last flink upgrading work is also not a good experience (See the [discussion](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1956) and [comment](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1956#discussion_r546534299) ),  because the flink 1.12 also breaks several API that was annotated `PublicEvolving` in flink 1.11.0,  that becomes one of the most important reasons leading to the conclusion that stops support flink 1.11.0 in our apache iceberg branch ( Supporting new features [such as flip-27 unified iceberg source/sink] that depends the API introduced in flink 1.12  is another reason).   To better support the compatibility of downstream systems and delivering better experience to flink users,  I will strongly suggest the Apache Flink community to pay more attention to ensuring API compatibility.   \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/928755046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/928759960","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3187#issuecomment-928759960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3187","id":928759960,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843W8CY","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T04:10:21Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T04:10:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI @twalthr, @tillrohrmann,  @StephanEwen, @zentol, @aljoscha, @rmetzger, @fhueske, @dawidwys","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/928759960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/928769719","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/3187#issuecomment-928769719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3187","id":928769719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX843W-a3","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T04:20:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T05:56:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In short term,  I don't think the apache flink will release a new version to address the compatibility issue recently.

We are trying our best to avoid API breaking changes. Thanks\r\n> for giving us feedback.\r\n> \r\n> There has been a reason why Table API was marked as `@PublicEvolving`\r\n> instead of `@Public`. Over the last two years, we have basically rewritten\r\n> the entire API [1] to digest the Blink merge and making the Table API\r\n> stable and ready for the future. We tried our best to give users 1-2\r\n> releases time to upgrade their implementations whenever we deprecated\r\n> API but we were aware that this might cause frustration, but hopefully\r\n> for the greater good. We have reworked type system, Catalog API, schema,\r\n> source/sinks, functions and much more. Flink 1.14 will hopefully be the\r\n> last release with major API changes. We could also mark most Table API\r\n> interfaces as `@Public` in 1.15.\r\n> \r\n> For your mentioned incompatibility, I agree that the change from\r\n> CatalogTable to ResolvedCatalogTable was not very nice. Since\r\n> implementing a connector is not straight forward, we were expecting that\r\n> not many users implement custom connectors. We therefore consider this\r\n> part as kind of \"second level API\" for which we can evolve quicker. A\r\n> `context.getCatalogTable().getSchema()` should still work for 1.12 and\r\n> 1.13, at least that was the goal.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks again for the feedback.
