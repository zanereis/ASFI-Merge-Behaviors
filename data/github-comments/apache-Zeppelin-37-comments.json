How about we make them little bit different from other functions defined in the scope. For example instead of\n\n```\n$scope.runParagraph(..)\n$scope.pushToServer(...)\n```\n\ncollect all exposed function into `z`\n\n```\n$scope.z.runParagraph(...)\n$scope.z.pushToServer(...)\n```\n\nI this way, both user/developer can explicitly recognize which is exposed function to user. What do you think?\n\n<br />\n\n> - `pushToServer('varName', value, parameters)`\n\nOnce angularObject is created (binded), no matter who (front-end / back-end) creates, every change of binded scope variable automatically pushed to server.\nSo this function name may confuse a bit. How about different name, such as `bindAngularObject()` ?\n\nAnd this function give user access to any scope of AngularObjectRegistry of any Interpreter process.\nIs there any special reason? otherwise can we restrict parameters from\n\n```\nparameters = {\n     interpreter: 'spark',\n     interpreters: ['md', 'sh'],\n     paragraph: '20160126-153136_1060166247',\n     paragraphs: ['20160126-171914_843040190', '20160126-181556_1915782845'],\n     scope: 'note',\n     runParagraphs: false    \n}\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nparameters = {\n    scope : 'note'\n}\n```\n\nSo user's javascript code only able to access current paragraph or notebook scope of AngularObject in the current interpreter process.\n\n<br />\n\n> 3) Technical Impl\n> Regarding initialize AngularObjectRegistry on Interpreter creation using `angularRegistryPush()` looks good.\n\nAnd do you mind making separate PR for change regarding dynamic form?\nThat i'm not quite sure the benefit of reading angularObject in dynamic form compare to the complexity it brings. I mean complexity of the concept and expected behavior that user need to understand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/177319760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/177320638","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/674#issuecomment-177320638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/674","id":177320638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NzMyMDYzOA==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-30T22:29:47Z","updated_at":"2016-01-30T22:29:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Let's

I mean complexity of the concept and expected behavior that user need to understand.\n\nI think I did not define clearly the objectives of this PR so let me explain it again:\n\n**Functional requirements**: As a Zeppelin user, I would like to design an HTML form which:\n1. can have custom styling and look n feel\n2. can have extended form inputs (email input, calendar, checkbox, items list ...)\n3. can have custom behaviors (changing a drop-down will hide/show extra form inputs)\n4. can control the execution of one or many other **paragraph(s)** in the **same note**\n5. can interact with the AngularObjectRegistry for one or many other **paragraph(s)** in the **same note**. For example, in my form, I want to set an Angular variable called \"name\" and in another **pagragraph** execute the SparkSQL query:  \n\n``` sql\n%sql\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE name = ${name}\n```\n\nCurrent Zeppelin **dynamic forms** can be enhanced to support points 2. and 5. but I think it's very hard (unless we redesign it from scratch) to support all other points. And I want to have a very flexible form system so I need to design my HTML form in another paragraph with %angular\n\n**That's the main reason I want to be able to override dynamic forms system if a variable is already present in the AngularObjectRegistry** (_whether it was bound by a zeppelin context or by an AngularJS function client-side, it doesn't matter_). Currently to achieve the same goal, you need to use the `z.angularUnbind()`, `z.angularBind()` and attach listener **programmatically** using Scala like in this video: https://youtu.be/J6Ei1RMG5Xo?t=944. It's very cumbersome, as a web-designer, I want to use pure HTML and AngularJS javascript to design my forms\n\n> i'd suggest split it into multiple smaller PR, if possible.\n\nTotally agree, I would propose to split this PR in smaller ones like:\n1. Add Show/Hide paragraph ID feature\n2. Add AngularJS utilities functions (or we can split it in smaller PR, one for each function (_bindToAngular()_, _unbindFromAngular()_ ...) but I think one PR for all the functions is enough\n3. Override the existing dynamic form with AngularJS \n\n>  collect all exposed functions into `z``\n\n +1 Good idea\n\n> So this function name may confuse a bit. How about different name, such as bindAngularObject() ?\n\n+1. I will rename to `bindAngularObject()` and `unbindAngularObject()` to match naming convention from the `ZeppelinContext` object\n\n> And this function give user access to any scope of AngularObjectRegistry of any Interpreter process.\n> Is there any special reason?\n\nThere are **serious reasons** for the current design.\n\nRight now, the current scope of the AngularObjectRegistry are, in descending order:\n1. Interpreter Group \n2. Global\n3. Note\n4. Paragraph\n\nIf we want to bind an angular object to a particular **paragraph**, the noteId is not necessary because we always choose the id from the current note (and it is not possible to change it to enforce note scope isolation). However, because of point 1. above, we need to provide also the interpreter group (so the interpreter name) of the paragraph otherwise we won't be able to retrieve the AngularObjectRegistry at the server-side. The below piece of code does this job:\n\n``` java\nfinal InterpreterGroup interpreterGroup = findGroupForInterpreter(noteId, note.getNoteReplLoader().getInterpreterSettings(), interpreterName);\n\nfinal AngularObjectRegistry registry = interpreterGroup.getAngularObjectRegistry();\n```\n\n That explain why in the `parameters` map, we have the properties `interpreter: 'sh'` or `interpreters: ['sh','md']`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/177470392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/177487227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/278#issuecomment-177487227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/278","id":177487227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NzQ4NzIyNw==","user":{"login":"vrajat","id":1638298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzgyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1638298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat","html_url":"https://github.com/vrajat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrajat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-31T12:22:07Z","updated_at":"2016-01-31T12:22:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah ha!
