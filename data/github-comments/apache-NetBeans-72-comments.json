What I'm missing is an analysis what is the underlying the problem \r\n\r\nSee the first statement of this github PR thread; and dev list thread `Re: API is ... was: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2482` has some historical information about the NetBeans evolution related to this issue. To summarize: ModelToView returns bounding box with width 1 for a tab (_New Editor View Hierarchy_ introduced in 2010), the BaseCaret changes this to 2. This becomes the clip for drawing the caret in BaseCaret#update which ends with `c.repaint(caretBounds)`.\r\n\r\n> and why it can only be solved by providing a new property,\r\n\r\nOnly? It was not my intention to say this PR was the only solution.\r\n\r\n> that we might need to support for a long time. \r\n\r\nThis change is marked in arch.xml as \"devel\" and it's in a \"devel\" module. No commitment/suggestion of long term support.\r\n\r\n> I read through `paintCustomCarent` and indeed the caret size is not set there. This would be easier, if the code would even be exercised. In the IDE the `BaseCaret#paint` method is never hit, so it is difficult to see what is really the problem.\r\n\r\nI didn't realize until this week that BaseCaret was no longer used by the Standard IDE editors. But since you now know that the new (2015) EditorCaret exhibits the same problem, you could probably look there. There are probably other plugins around that use BaseCaret, but if you're really interested in seeing the code action, you could install jVi.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Is it right, that you provide a custom caret and override `painCustomCarent`?\r\n> \r\n\r\nYes. And by this time it's too late, the clip is set.\r\n\r\n> Am I right that the problem you are seeing is caused by the repaint call in `actionPerformed` being invoked with a too small area?\r\n\r\nrepaint is called from a variety of places. The setting of the clip region is through BaseCaret#updateCaretBounds, which is primarily called through BaseCaret#update","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/717300266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/717312901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2482#issuecomment-717312901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2482","id":717312901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzMxMjkwMQ==","user":{"login":"errael","id":20450427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwNDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael","html_url":"https://github.com/errael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T15:12:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T15:12:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Recapitulation**\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in `BaseCaret` the `caretBounds`, which becomes the clip region, is essentially set directly from `modelToView` without regard to the caret's drawing algorithms. This is usually OK since caret is typically drawn over a \"normal\" character and there's typically no need to draw outside the character bounds. However for the TAB, and probably for other invisible characters, modelToView provides unreasonable values (width 1).\r\n\r\nI believe the caret drawing algorithm should have input into the required bounding box; relying on historical information from paintCustomCaret seems wrong. One possibility is to have a method, for example `int getCaretMinWidth(...)` or maybe `Dimension getCaretSize(...)` or ...\r\n\r\nThe idea of using a property gives considerable flexibility for experimenting with different solutions without having a hard signature-API and breaking client code at compile or runtime. The worst that happens is reverting back to poor choice of clip region.\r\n\r\nUsing an `IntUnaryOperator` seems simplest for now (considering the problem has existed for 10 years with BaseCaret and 5 years for EditorCaret). This could be changed in the future to require a `Funtion` which accepts an API defined input object parameter and returns a Dimension, or a Rectangle, or an Integer. If such a change were made, BaseCaret could continue to support the simple IntUnaryOperator or not (this is marked devel, it can change). All without an API-signature change. If in the fullness of time there's an accepted solution, a method could be added.\r\n\r\nOther solutions could involve punting and giving \"huge\" clip regions. Having a way to get a value from `paintCustomCaret` could be designed, but it seems wrong and it's hard to see how that would work without major redesign; using an old value doesn't make sense particularly if variable fonts are used. There are undoubtedly other solutions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/717312901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/717317776","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2482#issuecomment-717317776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2482","id":717317776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNzMxNzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"errael","id":20450427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwNDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael","html_url":"https://github.com/errael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-27T15:20:00Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T15:20:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jtulach \r\n\r\n> Missing test, proper module versioning, entry in `apichanges.xml`, description in `arch.xml` with `<api group=\"property\" ... />`.\r\n\r\nAre the requirements satisfied (independent of the content which is still under discussion)?
