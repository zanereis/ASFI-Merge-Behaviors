shouldn't be merged until  https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4250 is merged.\r\n\r\nFor testing, you can download/clone Zookeeper 3.5.5+ and export the key and trust stores as environment variables:\r\n```\r\nexport SERVER_JVMFLAGS=\"\r\n-Dzookeeper.serverCnxnFactory=org.apache.zookeeper.server.NettyServerCnxnFactory\r\n-Dzookeeper.ssl.keyStore.location=conf/security/keystore.jks\r\n-Dzookeeper.ssl.keyStore.password=keystorePassword\r\n-Dzookeeper.ssl.trustStore.location=conf/security/truststore.jks\r\n-Dzookeeper.ssl.trustStore.password=truststorePassword\"\r\n```\r\nSet the zoo.cfg as follows:\r\n```\r\ntickTime=2000\r\ninitLimit=10\r\nsyncLimit=5\r\ndataDir=/tmp/zookeeper\r\nsecureClientPort=2281\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run ./bin/zkServer.sh\r\n\r\nYou can then set the nifi.properties TLS configuration using the 2281 client port for Zookeeper:\r\n```\r\nnifi.zookeeper.connect.string=localhost:2281\r\nnifi.zookeeper.connect.timeout=10 secs\r\nnifi.zookeeper.session.timeout=10 secs\r\nnifi.zookeeper.root.node=/nifi\r\nnifi.zookeeper.client.secure=true\r\nnifi.zookeeper.security.keystore=./conf/keystore.jks\r\nnifi.zookeeper.security.keystoreType=JKS\r\nnifi.zookeeper.security.keystorePasswd=keystorePassword\r\nnifi.zookeeper.security.truststore=./conf/truststore.jks\r\nnifi.zookeeper.security.truststoreType=JKS\r\nnifi.zookeeper.security.truststorePasswd=truststorePassword\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the state-management.xml\r\n```\r\n    <cluster-provider>\r\n        <id>zk-provider</id>\r\n        <class>org.apache.nifi.controller.state.providers.zookeeper.ZooKeeperStateProvider</class>\r\n        <property name=\"Connect String\">localhost:2281</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Root Node\">/nifi</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Session Timeout\">10 seconds</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Keystore Filepath\">./conf/keystore.jks</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Keystore Password\">keystorePassword</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Keystore Type\">JKS</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Truststore Filepath\">./conf/truststore.jks</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Truststore Password\">truststorePassword</property>\r\n        <property name=\"Truststore Type\">JKS</property>\r\n    </cluster-provider>\r\n```\r\nYou should then be able to run a secure cluster, and the leader election and state management will operate over TLS. I used a ListSFTP processor to check the state management was working as expected, checked the values in Zookeeper with the bin/zkCli.sh, and used Wireshark on TCP port 2281 to see the TLS negotiation and traffic. I also verified no traffic was passing on TCP 2181.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/706276736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/706331138","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4576#issuecomment-706331138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4576","id":706331138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjMzMTEzOA==","user":{"login":"pkelly-nifi","id":71455011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDU1MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71455011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi","html_url":"https://github.com/pkelly-nifi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkelly-nifi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-09T18:14:40Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T18:14:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, ADLS Gen2 does support pulling by range.

Sometimes, we notice validation connection being waiting forever whenever the database access error happens either due to database refresh/clone. Generally, DBA team does database refresh/clone every month or twice a month. This is rare scenario that happens but however we never get response from a failed request as it gets hung waiting. Adding timeout to validation connection forces to timeout and successfully returns failure response to complete the request.\r\n\r\nThanks for Hive_1.1ConnectionPool, I completely missed it. I have changed that as well. Thanks again.
