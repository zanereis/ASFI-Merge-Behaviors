The timezone logic is possibly more nuances especially if we’re talking about non-explicit timezone formats, i.e., not epoch which is in reference to UTC.\r\n\r\nThere are three different clocks:\r\n\r\n1. The database engine\r\n2. The Superset server\r\n3. The Superset client\r\n\r\nin addition to possible timezone encoding in the data. Unless ISO 8601 times are encoded with the timezone (which can be specified in the time range picker) the time logic can become quite complex especially if all three clocks are not using the same timezone.\r\n\r\nCurrently for the time range picker absolute times are specified using the client clock (or per this PR use UTC as the local time) without a designated timezone. Similarly relative times are evaluated on the Superset server using the server clock without a designated timezone. When the query is run the times are in reference to the local time of the database engine. This can get quite messy if the timezones differ as it’s not apparent (especially for relative times) what the reference point is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/546226319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/546239066","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7715#issuecomment-546239066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7715","id":546239066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjIzOTA2Ng==","user":{"login":"runningdata","id":22429697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDI5Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22429697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata","html_url":"https://github.com/runningdata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runningdata/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-25T07:33:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T07:33:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> The only way to do this at the moment is by using views as a datasource (where the view is making the join).
