have a similar problem with cache_timeout\r\n\r\n### **Superset version**\r\n0.23.0dev\r\n\r\n### **Expected results**\r\nIt seems setting cached timeout means to get data again from datasource and rebuild the slice too. \r\n\r\n### **Actual results**\r\nSlice timeout setting is never used\r\n\r\n### **Steps to reproduce**\r\nI set cache timeout for the data source equal to 1 seconds and in `NVD3TimeSeriesViz` I add a line \r\n`cache_timeout=5`\r\nThen I created a table in an SQLite database that is updating every 5 seconds and I also create a slice with type `Time Series - Line Chart`. The slice cannot update itself every 5 seconds.
