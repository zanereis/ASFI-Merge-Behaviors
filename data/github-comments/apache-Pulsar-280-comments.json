latest commit includes a fix to make the pulsar python client available to the `root` and the `pulsar` user. This is necessary for pulsar functions and was exposed by the pulsar function integration tests, which currently run as the root user in the `pulsar-test-latest-version` docker container (this image defaults to run as root).\r\n\r\nI think we should convert the pulsar function tests to run as the `pulsar` user. I'll look at adding that to a later commit.\r\n\r\nThese test failures (related to problems running as root vs pulsar) raise an important question about backwards compatibility and the published docker images. I think it adds value to let the container run as either the root user or the pulsar user to allow for end users to transition to the non-root version. As such, this commit installs the pulsar python client so that it's available to the root and pulsar. \r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think it is necessary to run tests as the root user because it is unlikely that the root user will have any other problems. Based on a limited understanding of the tests, the pulsar functions are likely one of the only processes that rely on python, making it the only process that use the pip dependencies. It'd be great to have some perspective from people more familiar with the project and any other edge cases in different deployments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/753227507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/753243732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/9094#issuecomment-753243732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/9094","id":753243732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzI0MzczMg==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-01T02:36:59Z","updated_at":"2021-01-01T02:36:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/753243732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/753248674","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8975#issuecomment-753248674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8975","id":753248674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzI0ODY3NA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-01T03:38:32Z","updated_at":"2021-01-01T03:38:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@eolivelli Can this problem be reproduced stably?

@sijie I believe it was just an issue of a missing nil check for non-sink functions, since the purpose of the code in the first place seems to check for a configured `BatchBuilder` and then setting the new Producer's batch builder to use it. That said, now that I look at it more closely, I'm relatively concerned with the number of log messages indicating a new producer server-side for each message. Is this okay and, if so, is there any way we can suppress these?
