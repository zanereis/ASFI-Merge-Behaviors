However, the willingness to somehow comply with the existing submitting semantics is not the only reason on moving away from introducing high-level Mesos scheduler from our side, it’s rather kind of a side effect. So, consider the case that would take place should we introduce a high level scheduler here, as the initial implementation suggests. The question is what would happen when this high level scheduler itself would fail? Should there be another Mesos scheduler layer to recover this scheduler? I think you should get the point by now. So obviously, at some point you should have a Mesos scheduler which features highly availability mode, therefore can run multiple scheduler copies on the cluster and having only one leader which actually is registered with Mesos. It goes without saying that leader election algorithm should be implemented here. There are also some suggestions on implementing such a feature in the Mesos docs just to get a full picture: http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/high-availability-framework-guide/. So, in short, if we would use the initial implementation we were given, we wouldn’t succeed in creating failover ready solution because high availability mode wasn’t implemented there. Generally, of course, we could implement it in the Heron-Mesos, but, first, this is partly a reinventing the wheel, as there are proven solutions for this kind of problems, we could rely on, for example, Marathon and Singularity. Another thing is that it’s not only obviously a significant effort in terms of resources, but it’s also a part which in case of some implementation issues can make a real mess. I remember Marathon have had a bug some time ago, where the ZK data was in some rare cases messed up badly during the leadership election, and this caused harm not only to Marathon, but Mesos cluster itself as well. So, for us the way to go here was actually using Marathon, feeding it the “heron submit” command. As you may notice, we also use Zookeeper as a data storage for the scheduler, so when it is recovered, it just can pick up where things were left off. The only thing, probably worth fixing in the approach is that we should maybe be more explicit in pointing out to long-running processes schedulers like Marathon and Singularity in the Mesos scheduler docs.\nAnother concern you pointed out about Heron possibly trying to recover a running job was actually addressed in one of my previous comments. In short, yes, the logic on recovering is not yet implemented, the thing to note here is that Mesos launcher, if asked to recover, will try to do a healthcheck on the scheduler HTTP server, and will take actions on recovering only if the healthcheck fails.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229949668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229955502","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/962#issuecomment-229955502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/962","id":229955502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTk1NTUwMg==","user":{"login":"lewiskan","id":3859532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTk1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3859532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan","html_url":"https://github.com/lewiskan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lewiskan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T14:04:14Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T14:04:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@kramasamy - I need to incorporate @tysonnorris enhancement to use docker-compose rather than simple bashrc.

Otherwise, git log grows unchecked and the repo checkout time becomes larger. Furthermore, when a software is open sourced, we don't want to expose the history due to confidential reasons. Based on practical experience, a history more than a year is used very rarely.\n\n2 - In our case, the core developers pretty much know the history. Again as I said in 1) very rarely there is a need to go back in history beyond a certain time.\n\n3 - New comers tend to work with the provided environment. In an environment, where the software is continuously tested and everything seems to be working pretty well, new comers hardly tend to look at the history - unless it is really needed, again not more than a given window of time.\n\n4 - Software evolution using a history is valuable. It is difficult to understand only from code. For such evolution documentation is more helpful.\n\nJust to reiterate, these are my opinions based on practical experience.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229981994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229984328","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/965#issuecomment-229984328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/965","id":229984328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTk4NDMyOA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-01T16:01:13Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T16:01:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lilalinda - When you use `file:///` semantics, it refers to local file.

In that case we manually change tracer.py's should_log to return True. This is an ugly hack and it would be much better if bazels verbose flags caused verbosity to be correctly set within pex.
