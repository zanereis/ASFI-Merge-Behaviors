it is a good idea for this Exception to deal like \"mysql connection refuse \" ? We use this in game's mysql meta data, so I think it is normal for game to \"start a new server \" or \"merge two server \" or \"close a old server \". In this case , I have to often to `ADD RESROUCE` and `DROP RESOURCE` , and then execute SQL `ALTER SHARDING TABLE RULE xxxx` for every table like `hero/vip/user/account` and so on .  Besides, every time when I execute `ADD RESOURCE` will cost about 3 mins for one time(just in commad tell me success, it really can use maybe need 11 mins [It maybe flush connection in backgroud] ) and  `ALTER SHARDING TABLE RULE xxxx` cost about 4mins for one table  , so I even can't not flush all data in an hour.

The purpose of this is to reuse one connection to process different meta of tables , and then we just reflush metadata X times (the resources we have)  instead of Y times (the Cartesian Product of resource's number and table's number ). \r\neg. We have 100 datasource and 200 tables  in every dataresource(which in different LAN) , we need to reflush 100*200=2000 times , surpose every time we need 1s , it will cost us 2000s (about 33.3 min). But if we can reuse connection with batch sql , we just reflush 100 times which cost us 100s (about 1.7min) , and it must cost more than 1s in really operate because of the different of processing one table  and processing 200 tables . But I think maybe it is a good direction of optimization .
