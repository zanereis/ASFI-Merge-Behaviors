looks like a great start on re-ordering data to return in reverse-time order.\n\nOne big thing that this highlighted for me, however, is how the `descending` flag is being delivered.  It definitely works to add it as has been done, but every time we want to add a new flag like this, we shouldn't have to extend every single query to support it.  So that got me thinking which of the parts of the query would be best to house that flag.  Immediate options as I see them are\n1. `granularity` - given that the descending flag applies to how the time grain is ordered, adding it here could make sense.  But, at the same time, that reason seems weak.\n2. `intervals` - kinda the same logic as granularity: it's something that deals with time...\n3. `context` - it's an extra flag that changes the behavior of queries.  But, so far things in `context` are somewhat meta.  They are extra things specific to a query type or specific to how Brokers/Historicals comunicate, etc.\n\nAfter going through all these options and realizing that I don't like any of them, what do people think about introduce a new element to the `Query` to replace `granularity` and `intervals`.  We could call it the `timeSpec` and it would have 3 fields for now\n1. `granularity`\n2. `intervals`\n3. `ascending`\n\nAs we get more things related to how a specific query processes time, we could add them here.  What do people think?  Am I over-thinking it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/160783936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/160784277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2014#issuecomment-160784277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2014","id":160784277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDc4NDI3Nw==","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-30T22:38:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-30T22:38:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One thing I wonder about is how the merge happens when we go in a different time-sort order.

If it is possible for an InputRow to have duplicates, then this error is possible, and in this case I feel it's important to throw a descriptive error (instead of index out of bounds).\n\nThe solution that feels most correct to me (and removes the need for this kind of check) is to make it impossible, via the dimension data structure returned by the InputRow, to have duplicates.  Something like the OrderedSet interface.  However, I realize that there is a cost to changes in the public API.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/160786323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/160837376","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/2013#issuecomment-160837376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2013","id":160837376,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDgzNzM3Ng==","user":{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T03:19:54Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T03:19:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/160837376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/160895364","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2014#issuecomment-160895364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2014","id":160895364,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDg5NTM2NA==","user":{"login":"navis","id":809395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/809395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis","html_url":"https://github.com/navis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T08:42:53Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T08:42:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Implemented `descending` order only for search/timeseries/timebound/topn queries and caching is disabled for them.

I've also thought on the position of `descending` field and `QuerySegmentSpec` in `BaseQuery` looked good position of that (`granularity` also can be included in it). But I've decided not to make too many changes for now. We can discuss on this when the functionality is settled. \n\nFor merging works, I thing I've changed related codes(comparators, etc.) but cannot sure I've done it right. I'll add more tests on current supported query types and also will make group-by and select queries support descending.
