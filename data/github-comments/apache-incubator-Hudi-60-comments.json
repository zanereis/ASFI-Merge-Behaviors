Your understanding is right. Checkpoints are written to hoodie commit metadata after each round of DeltaStreamer run.\r\n\r\nThe Exception you described seems to be possible if the offfsets supplied is larger or smaller than what the server has for a given partition. I am suspecting if this could be be because of retention policy of the kafka topic kicking in. It should be easy to check this. I think  some command like this ```kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server server_ip:9092 --describe --topic topic_name``` will help print the topic config.

After some digging I found a solution. \r\n\r\nThe problem was that the spark did not load the jars specified in `HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH` and on the Cloudera Data Platform the `spark-defaults.conf` has the following properties.\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspark.sql.hive.metastore.jars=${env:HADOOP_COMMON_HOME}/../hive/lib/*:${env:HADOOP_COMMON_HOME}/client/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem I edited the `spark-defaults.conf` via the Cloudera Manager and added the path to the hudi-mr-bundle jars. \r\n\r\nHere is a brief description on how to resolve the issue on CDP:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Cloudera Manager > Cluster > Spark > Configuration > search for \"safety\".\r\n\r\n2.

In short there is no direct API to support that use case in Hudi currently. This use case usually fits a K-V storage system that can return versions of a record when queried. Hudi provides the most recent version of a record within the time bounds specified int he query(if incremental) or the latest value if no time bound is specified. \r\n\r\nHowever, this can be worked around by querying individual commits involved in the original incremental query and the results can be union-ed in the application side. For example, in your example above, if the original query specified 0-T3 as time bounds, you could get list of all commits that happened in this time and split the query based on those individual commits. So in this case it would be three queries 0 - T1, T1 - T2 and T2 - T3. These will get V1, V2 and V3 for K1 respectively. I also created a jirs - https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-976 to provide a utility tool that can do this.

Thanks Bhavani! I'd love to take this up. I'll research and get back to you on how to proceed.\r\nFollow up question on above. How'd a consumer know the timings of the changed records? It asking a simple question, what changed for key K over the period of time (to recompute or even rollback something looking at the history). \r\n\r\nYour explanation is  absolutely perfect and I tried it too, with the different times(T1/T2/T3), it works seamlessly. So, should I consider it a feature that can be added(look at the history of a record) as its completely doable. Hudi has the history of everything, it can look up by times, why can't it look up by the key? Or, is it something by design that Hudi doesn't intend to do.\r\n\r\nOr even table history would be good. As an example, Databricks delta has something called 'Describe history' which can give you the full history of the table, what changed over time and then you can rollback/time travel from those specific commit ids.\r\n\r\nThanks again, just trying to understand what questions are right in terms of Hudi design.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/635613375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/635634106","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1675#issuecomment-635634106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1675","id":635634106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNTYzNDEwNg==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-28T22:08:09Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T22:08:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@abhibhat98 Thanks for the thought provoking questions.. table history, is something we already support via the CLI tool..  \r\n\r\n>> Hudi has the history of everything, it can look up by times, why can't it look up by the key? \r\n\r\nOr, is it something by design that Hudi doesn't intend to do.\r\nTypically key value stores (HBase, bigtable) are able to do this, because they have an effective index to fetch keys out..
