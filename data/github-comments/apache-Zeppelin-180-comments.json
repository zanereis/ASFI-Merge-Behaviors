Previously there was a big jar containing the interpreter class as well, which doesn't exists anymore. We've updated the PR, so that all jar files from local repo are enumerated with --jar option to spark-submit, which probably is a better approach. \r\nWith regards to deploy mode: just tried to add `spark.submit.deployMode` property via UI and it worked for me,  we do set this by default to `cluster` in our custom interpreter.json, as well as the master property to `k8s://https://kubernetes:443` however intentionally didn't included in the patch, since this is only optional.\r\nWe are using this patch about a half year now, in our deployments and works fine for us, would be glad to contribute to community.
