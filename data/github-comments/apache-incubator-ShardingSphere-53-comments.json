Hint is sharding strategy, it should be injected into `table-strategy-ref` or `database-strategy-ref`\r\n\r\nIn your example, you injected `sharding:standard-strategy` not `sharding:hint-strategy`, so this function will not be called.\r\n\r\nyou can change like following and retry\r\n\r\n```\r\n<bean id=\"tableShardingAlgorithmByMonth\" class=\"com.xxx.TableShardingAlgorithmByMonth\"></bean>\r\n<bean id=\"hintTestBean\" class=\"com.xxx.ModuloHintShardingAlgorithm\"></bean>\r\n<sharding:hint-strategy id=\"hintStrategy\"  algorithm-ref=\"hintTestBean\" ></sharding:hint-strategy>\r\n<sharding:standard-strategy id=\"payOrderPreciseAlgorithm\" sharding-column=\"create_date\" precise-algorithm-ref=\"tableShardingAlgorithmByMonth\"></sharding:standard-strategy>\r\n<sharding:data-source id=\"shardingDataSource\">\r\n    <sharding:sharding-rule data-source-names=\"dataSource\">\r\n        <sharding:table-rules>\r\n            <sharding:table-rule logic-table=\"pay_order\" table-strategy-ref=\"hintStrategy\"  />\r\n

`sharding:hint-strategy` as a default table strategy like \r\n```\r\n<bean id=\"tableShardingAlgorithmByMonth\" class=\"com.xxx.TableShardingAlgorithmByMonth\"></bean>\r\n<bean id=\"hintTestBean\"

id=\"shardingDataSource\">\r\n    <sharding:sharding-rule data-source-names=\"dataSource\" default-table-strategy-ref=\"hintStrategy\">\r\n        <sharding:table-rules>\r\n
