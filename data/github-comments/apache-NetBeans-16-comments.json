So any GPL library will either need to be removed, upgraded to a version with a more acceptable license, or handled in some other way\r\nd) even if the new modules are part of the same repository, we will run verify-libs-and-licenses, rat and other checks only on the basic cluster config, i.e. the new modules don't need to be perfect at the beginning, as they won't be checked.

The file is mostly copied verbatim (only multiple empty lines are collapsed into one). To make the suggested indention possible, there would need to be a fixed notice file format.

It requires either for 9 and 10 ```--add-exports jdk.unsupported/sun.misc=ALL-UNNAMED``` or for 11 ```--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED```. But the problem is you cannot use ```-add-modules``` or ```--add-exports``` when using ```--release```. There maybe some other way to use that stuff. But I believe even under older releases they do not expose that stuff. I have not really been able to use release with anything that requires modules or exports.\r\n\r\nLet this serve as more of a heads up than direct fixes. Surely for NamedImportScope. Though not sure there is much point in supporting 9. I think its more just 8 and 10, then 11. Of course I would say go 11+ only for like NB 10. But that is likely not practical.\r\n\r\nThough IMHO why build the latest Netbeans using an older JDK. Or even allow it to run on older JDK. Unless you mean development support. Even then IMHO they can use older version of Netbeans or other for older JDK. It is always fascinating to me for those to use newer libraries or applications and older JDK. I myself have never had to stick with an older JDK. Even like in Gentoo people still ran older versions of Tomcat. Which I never understoood either. My stuff has always been able to move to newer without issue. Even some legacy stuff from 1.4 days I keep bugging the client to update :)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/394164237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/394192350","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/574#issuecomment-394192350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/574","id":394192350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDE5MjM1MA==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-03T21:20:29Z","updated_at":"2018-06-03T21:20:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Create a new one based on master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/394192350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/394236040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/552#issuecomment-394236040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/552","id":394236040,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDIzNjA0MA==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-04T05:12:27Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T05:12:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@geertjanw @emilianbold Just pinging on this as the PR for one of our Blocker issues.
