But as for \"TO_BASE64 takes a BINARY or VARBINARY, not a VARCHAR, as argument.\" , considering Mysql specifies that \"Converts the string argument to base-64 encoded form and returns the result as a character string with the connection character set and collation. \" https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html#function_to-base64.  I'm not sure if it must change its argument to BINARY or VARBINARY?  So I let TO_BASE64 can take both string and  binary string as argument.  Hope get some advises. Thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/497922600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/497945383","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1168#issuecomment-497945383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1168","id":497945383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Nzk0NTM4Mw==","user":{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-01T13:29:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-01T13:30:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chunweilei

However, I noticed that there are a few changes on public API that are useful only for the new tests and some of them also break backward compatibility. As far as I can see for the tests, the only thing that you need is a plan with a custom filter/project, join, plus some table scans. I don't think it is necessary to pass from the SqlToRelConverter to do this. (It would be nice but we should not stress too much). You can use a custom RelBuilder to create the plan directly and apply the rules on it. Like that you will not have to introduce changes in so many places. Let me know how does this look.\r\n\r\n@zabetak , I have addressed your comments by writing tests in a different manner. Please take a look when you get a chance.

The difficulties I faced are:\r\n\r\n- Unparsing the operator will produce the `CAST` syntax, not the original one `::`, which is ok I guess, what do you think ? May be not ok ?\r\n- The modification I made enabled me to parse the operator but I can't return a function (i.e. `CAST`) at this point because the production is returning `List<Object>`. I will try again and see if I can do this differently.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/500129608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/500167476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1260#issuecomment-500167476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1260","id":500167476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMDE2NzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"hbtoo","id":14156763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTU2NzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14156763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo","html_url":"https://github.com/hbtoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hbtoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-08T21:51:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-08T21:51:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @julianhyde, I have update all the detailed explanation (the bug, the test case that trigger the bug and why) in the description of JIRA CALCITE-3118.

I have addressed  the test case. As for the JdbcConvention#toString(),  it returns the name of the Convention which is \"JDBC.\" + name. And the name is specified when creating a JdbcSchema.   So it  maybe not obey the description pattern of the rule. As far as I know, the description of JdbcToEnumerableConverterRule is \"JdbcToEnumerableConverterRule:\" + out too. To solve this problem, I add a unique signature which obey the description pattern of the rule in JdbcConvention and override JdbcConvention#toString to get this signature.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/503550011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/504404279","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/800#issuecomment-504404279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/800","id":504404279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDQwNDI3OQ==","user":{"login":"wenhuitang","id":42363767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzNzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang","html_url":"https://github.com/wenhuitang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wenhuitang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T12:15:11Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T12:15:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Rather then `(temp.length() / 76) > 0` why not write `temp.length() > 76`?\r\n> \r\n> Punctuation consistent with surrounding code.
