Since there are only 3 or 4 functions, why not put them couch app?\r\n\r\n@nickva Few reasons:\r\n1. I remember Paul mentioned a vision where `couch` app would eventually go away so we shouldn't add new functions to it. He didn't mention the details so I interpret his vision as we would remove all functionality from `couch` app and then probably rename `fabric` into `couch`.\r\n2. There are few applications which depend on `couch`. This creates circular dependency between applications. We have a very nasty instance of this problem between `config` and `couch_log`. It makes things harder to use/release/test.\r\n3. We need a place where we can put auxiliary functions useful from any application. Things like:\r\n- couch_util:to_hex\r\n- couch_util:integer_to_boolean\r\n- function to manipulate JSON (extract and modify)\r\nThe fact that these are in `couch` was a deal breaker few times already.

In our (CouchDB) case, we simply link to worker when we check it out from the pool so this link is not a \"parent\" link so that means `terminate/2` won't be called and the ibrowse worker won't stop.\r\n\r\n[1] A parent in OTP terminology is indicated by a [pdict entry]( https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/gen.erl#L481-L489). And the code to call `terminate/2` only when receiving `'EXIT'` from parents is https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/gen_server.erl#L480-L481\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/833021619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/833088357","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1741#issuecomment-833088357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1741","id":833088357,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzA4ODM1Nw==","user":{"login":"alcastle","id":1896826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTY4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1896826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle","html_url":"https://github.com/alcastle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alcastle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-05T22:22:35Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T22:22:35Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just ran into this as well and can confirm \r\nTurning on `delete_dbs` under the `couch_peruser` section of my config and restarting the service fixed it. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/833088357/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/comments/833190608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3543#issuecomment-833190608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3543","id":833190608,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMzE5MDYwOA==","user":{"login":"nickva","id":211822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTgyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva","html_url":"https://github.com/nickva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-06T03:06:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T03:06:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@QualityControll np!
