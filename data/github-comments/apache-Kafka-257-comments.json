i don't think this works by adding another state. The state transitions are happening on the Producers thread, yet we don't know we have successfully completed a transactional request until we get an `AddPartitionsToTxnResponse` or an `AddOffsetsToPartitionResponse`, which is happening on the sender thread. In the meantime the current state may have transitioned to subsequent states _before_ we get these responses. So when it comes to the time when we need to decide if we should send the `EndTxnRequest` we don't have any idea if the transaction was previously in the `STARTING_TRANSACTION` state. I thought adding a `previousState` might help, but no. As there may have been multiple

me summarize the changes in this patch. The main thing is a change in the compaction logic to _not_ preserve the base offset of each record batch. Previously if a record batch contained offsets [1,2,3] and if 1 was removed by the cleaner, the batch would still indicate 1 as its base offset. I couldn't think of a good reason to preserve the base offset from the original batch (we only need to ensure the last sequence is preserved for EoS) and it seemed a bit inconsistent with some of the actual usage. I therefore changed the behavior so that the new base offset always pointed to the offset of the first message (so it would be 2 using the example above). To reflect this change, I changed the name from \"base offset\" to \"first offset\". Similarly, I changed \"base sequence\" to \"first sequence\" and \"base timestamp\" to \"first timestamp.
