This means that some layer before us is buffering, and before we even process a surge of writes could OOM things.\r\n\r\nI think the most important and easiest thing would be to add an in-flight limit either here or in the MySQL impl (notably elasticsearch and cassandra already have in-flight limit).

been working on a Kafka 0.10 collector to see what would be involved in implementing one, primarily because the cluster I need Zipkin to consume span data from requires TLS. This isn't supported by the 0.8 consumer.\r\n\r\nI have followed the pattern laid out out by the Kafka 0.8 collector. There is a kafka10 collector module and corresponding auto-configuration module. The zipkin-server module has been modified to run the collector when KAFKA10_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS is set. It is functional at this point, although there is some cleanup to do in the collector and I'm suspect including the kafka10 collector in zipkin-server breaks the 0.8 collector. This is because the 0.10.2.0 version of kafka-clients takes precedence over the 0.8.x.x kafka-clients when resolving dependencies for zipkin-server. I'm not sure what the best way to address that classpath conflict is.\r\n\r\nThe work I've done so far is on the [kafka10-collector branch of my fork](https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/tree/kafka10-collector).

Right now, there are separate sets of properties for each Kafka collector, under the `zipkin.collector.kafka` and `zipkin.collector.kafka10` namespaces. I'm leaning towards re-using the `zipkin.collector.kafka` properties for the kafka10 collector. Most of the properties are applicable to both collectors, and `kafka10.consumer-threads` could be dropped in favor of `kafka.streams`. My only lingering concern is that some properties, e.g. `max-message-size`, will only apply to one version of the Kafka collector and that may lead to confusion.

Is there anything else about how this has been implemented that concerns you, isn't a good fit for your expected usage, or you think could be improved?\r\n* Thoughts on how to integrate this collector into zipkin-server without breaking the current 0.8 Kafka collector. The approach I've taken mostly likely breaks the 0.8 collector because of dependency resolution conflicts on different versions of kafka-clients. In the context of a docker deployment, Adrian mentioned checking for the Kafka collector environment variables and adjusting the classpath based on that. It sounds like that might work for you, because you're running Zipkin using docker. I will not be deploying it using docker. I could do the same thing with a wrapper shell script and I'd be fine with that solution.

Basically,\nonce there's a module dir the next step is seeing how lucky we are.. in\nbest case classpath order works and we don't need to hack the all jar to\ntake out the kafka08 stuff.\n\nIn the future, we could make a thin launcher\nhttps://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-thin-launcher as the default image\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/300023053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/300023317","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1405#issuecomment-300023317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1405","id":300023317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDAyMzMxNw==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-08T23:58:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T23:58:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PS rationale is that unlike SQS, we have existing deployments with Kafka.\nUpgrading these sites should be easy a possible (vs creating a new image),\nso let's try to get the docker image working.. better to try and fail than\nnot try and have people upset at now needing to think about multiple images\nwhen they formerly didn't.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/300023317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/300036463","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1405#issuecomment-300036463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1405","id":300036463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDAzNjQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"dgrabows","id":201525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/201525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrabows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-09T01:33:28Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T01:33:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That all makes sense.

I'm using a cheap `db.t2.micro` RDS instance that is dedicated to Zipkin. I saw bursts of up to ~1350 IOPS with average write sizes of 6.1KB, quickly exhausting the IO credit balance.\r\n\r\nSince the Zipkin MySQL client isn't batching and probably won't be any time soon, I \"detuned\" MySQL using the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` parameter. RDS's default parameter group doesn't set this and unless you've overridden it in your own parameter group then MySQL will default to flushing the InnoDB log to disk after every transaction.\r\n\r\nSince I don't especially care about the durability of trace data I set this parameter to `2`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWith a value of 2, the contents of the InnoDB log buffer are written to the log\r\nfile after each transaction commit and the log file is flushed to disk approximately\r\nonce per second. Once-per-second flushing is not 100% guaranteed to happen\r\nevery second, due to process scheduling issues. Because the flush to disk\r\noperation only occurs approximately once per second, you can lose up to a\r\nsecond of transactions in an operating system crash or a power outage.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change I saw that MySQL performs slightly larger writes but many fewer for the same workload. This was enough to make MySQL/RDS a workable solution for me.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/301073912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/301083616","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1457#issuecomment-301083616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1457","id":301083616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTA4MzYxNg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-12T13:57:34Z","updated_at":"2017-05-12T13:57:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"These are great notes.

am running into this exact problem right now.\r\n\r\nHaving the root be `/zipkin` would at least make it possible to put behind a proxy, like zuul, provided the person implementing is happy to change their proxy configuration to fit with zipkin's root (or is able to change their proxy configuration, for some people this will not be an option).\r\n\r\nBeing able to configure the root would make
