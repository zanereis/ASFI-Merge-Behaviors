I suggest NetBeans to use the [same version](https://github.com/apache/maven-indexer/blob/master/pom.xml#L95).\r\n\r\nyou mean maven-indexer? Thats exactly what this PR does. Latest 8.x is in use which is the same what maven-indexer 6.1x uses, Compatibility windows are described in the PR text and why this all had to be done in one step (5.x -> 8.x). The encountered problems are listed too. \r\n\r\nThe only potential showstopper remaining (IMO) is the discovered bug in lucene's hashcode logic, although it got quickly fixed thanks to lucene devs after I filed the issue, it doesn't really help us if it won't be backported to 8.x which we are stuck to due to the JDK 8 requirement of this module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1065082967/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1065171058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/3744#issuecomment-1065171058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/3744","id":1065171058,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M4_fThy","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-11T14:36:27Z","updated_at":"2022-03-11T15:58:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It wasn't an argument for or against `install-jdk.sh`.

I will describe my installation process, to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\n**1° Step:**\r\nI first downloaded netbeans from this link: \r\nhttps://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/netbeans/netbeans-installers/13/apache-NetBeans-13-bin-windows-x64.exe\r\n\r\n**2° Step:**\r\nI downloaded payara from this link: \r\nhttps://www.payara.fish/downloads\r\n\r\nAfter that extract payara folder to my local disk C\r\n\r\n**3° Step:**\r\nI downloaded Zulu OpenJDK 17, in this link:\r\nhttps://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.32.13-ca-jdk17.0.2-win_x64.zip\r\n\r\nAnd extract to C:\\Program Files\\Java folder\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158252993-58773694-0f6f-4e0b-baf8-762af9b0b488.png)\r\n\r\n**4° Step:**\r\nAfter that, I set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and added the Java path to my PATH\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158253288-907a2cfd-1f48-46ed-9187-272ea80ab8e3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158253417-099da086-8414-456b-a946-b33c776349ca.png)\r\n\r\n**5° Step:**\r\nI accessed the file C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans-13\\netbeans\\etc\\netbeans.conf and made sure that netbeans points to the correct JDK\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158253918-a6a466ec-69cf-4efa-9372-e8015c72d6bf.png)\r\n\r\n**6° Step:**\r\nMake sure I'm using the correct JDK\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158254434-6d2936fa-938e-4b84-ae2c-54e30e134c5b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158254487-618dd1f2-8b0d-429a-b775-e0bc24ca14f8.png)\r\n\r\n**7° Step:** \r\nI add my server to Netbeans\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158254680-f4a2033f-c138-4ee0-9ad2-1e270def08b2.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158254662-0c6687d6-fcd2-4ca9-8233-937e4cde3d06.png)\r\n\r\n**8° Step:**\r\nWhen I try to start the payara server through netbeans, I get the following message\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82112023/158255164-b8ffe153-288c-4e7c-8562-61ad86867f27.png)\r\n\r\nWhat does this imply? In this case I have JDK 11 on my machine, but the clients have JDK 17, that is, I need to debug in the same version that the clients are.\r\n\r\nI know it sounds futile, but we're suffering from it. We are willing to help, thank you very much for your attention, we are here to create an increasingly united community, count on us.\r\n\r\n**This is the information about my
