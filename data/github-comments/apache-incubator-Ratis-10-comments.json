I doubt whether we can identify listener when restart the cluster.\r\n\r\nCan you point the place that persist peers to storage to me? Sounds like we need to differentiate normal peer and listener in  the persisted data. At least in a RaftGroup we have a way to differentiate two kinds of servers. Generally speaking we need an extra bit to indicate a server is a listener.\r\n\r\nBut this is a good point about still making listener work even when restarting the cluster.\r\n\r\n> 2. Do we need to forbit normal peers sending RequestVote to listener ?\r\n\r\nI think forbidding listener participant voting greatly simplify the implementation while allowing listener join voting seems have no much benefits. One benefit I can think of is listener can help reject candidate whose log might be lagging behind. But the cost is the increasing algorithmic complexity. E.g. need to re-consider majority votes, should listener be counted or not? \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/772200643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/comments/772206230","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ratis/pull/409#issuecomment-772206230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ratis/issues/409","id":772206230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3MjIwNjIzMA==","user":{"login":"runzhiwang","id":51938049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTM4MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51938049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/runzhiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-03T04:01:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T04:01:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Can you point the place that persist peers to storage to me? \r\n\r\nsee `writeRaftConfiguration`\r\n\r\n> Do we need to forbit normal peers sending RequestVote to listener ?\r\n\r\nSorry, I did not make it clear.

I've pushed up another commit on my branch that I think shows the change is safe there.  For runs of `TestMetaServer`, I've changed allocation of workers in `LogServiceCluster` so that it will not set a port explicitly, and therefore the test hits the previously uncovered code in `BaseServer.Builder#validate()`.  For the masters, I couldn't do the same thing, because we need to know the full set of addresses up front to configure for quorum.  However, I was able to change it to use `NetUtils#createLocalServerAddress(int)`, so it's a different way of proving the change is safe.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a good change for the ratis-logservice tests.  Previously, `LogServiceCluster` required free ports in the 9xxx and 10xxx range, which might not be guaranteed on every machine.
