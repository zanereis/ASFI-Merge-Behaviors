First, apps and services using the normal (new) Kafka producer can specify the partition number when they produce a record. And when they do, the global partitioner never really is involved. In that sense, the \"global partitioner\" really doesn't seem very global; it seems more like a \"default partitioner\" called only when needed.\n\nAny time you're using stateful processors, you have to at least think about a partitioning strategy, and more often than not you will have to define and use one. Kafka proper had no support for stateful processing, and thus sharing stream is perhaps more common. Stateful processing is a significant feature of Kafka Streams, so it may come up far more often and is thus more important to Kafka Streams.\n\nEarlier you wrote:\n\n> - The cons of using another partitioner inside KStream along side with Kafka produer's partitioner are that it adds another layer of partitioning on top of it and hence may confuse some users, ...\n\nYes, it does add another layer of partitioning, but that layer is specific to Kafka Streams. So for developers using Kafka Streams (and not Kafka proper) it is far more natural to define the partitioner on the topology's sinks. Developers who are learning Kafka Streams are likely to discover that `StreamPartitioner.addSink` can take a `StreamPartitioner` parameter, and when they do they may be encouraged to think more about partitioning.\n\nConceptually, a `StreamPartitioner` is more straightforward, too:\n1. It has typed key and value objects.\n2. The number of partitions is passed into the `StreamPartitioner` method. This is one less thing a developer using Kafka Streams has to worry about, even though the partition count is pretty essential for many partitioning strategies. In fact, it even hints to the developer that they may need to take it into account.\n3. It's easy to understand how it's used. The nature of the topology ensures that any custom `StreamPartitioner` will only be called by the sink to which it was assigned, and the sink only handles messages that the topology's processors forward.\n4. No need to worry about other topics, how the default partitioning works, or messing up one of the other topics.\n\n> - ... and also is more vulnerable to resulted different partitioning schemes for shared topics from different processing topics.\n\nI fail to see how the proposed `StreamPartitioner` is more vulnerable than when an application or service using the Kafka producer determines the partition number on its own. The bottom line is that _if_ multiple processors/services/apps are all writing to a shared topic, you _must_ make sure that they all use the same partitioning strategy. Period. Performing the partitioning logic inside a \"global\" partitioner configured in multiple processes is no better or worse than doing it programmatically within your code. In fact, one could argue that specifying it in the configuration is actually _worse_, because it's something that should not vary between installations (see [this blog post](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2015/10/30/futureproof.html) for details).\n\nBTW, when developing this proposal, I looked for more direct ways a processor could specify the partition number, but specifying a partition number only makes sense when forwarding to sinks and in other cases any hint of a partition number messed up what is otherwise a clean API. I wonder: if I could have change the API more cleanly so that it was more akin to the Kafka producer API and let the processor set the partition number more directly, would there even have been a discussion about it conflicting with the global partitioner functionality?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/153896514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/153913038","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/299#issuecomment-153913038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/299","id":153913038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzkxMzAzOA==","user":{"login":"SinghAsDev","id":4915557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MTU1NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4915557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev","html_url":"https://github.com/SinghAsDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SinghAsDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-05T00:18:44Z","updated_at":"2015-11-05T00:18:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang

However, we'll still hit failures somtimes. On the source side, we can see duplicates sometimes, sort of due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2713 where a sink task can block during join for long enough that it hits the worker group timeout and the rest of the group moves on, but the source task then processes data even after its out of the group (and can commit offsets since it thinks it still owns that data).\n\nI've seen missing sink data, but haven't tracked down the issue yet. I haven't manage to catch it with good enough logging + a dump of the topic yet.\n\nWe can also see some unhandled exceptions currently because of wakeup exceptions during consumer.close(), an issue that was only introduced recently. (I'm coordinating w/ @hachikuji to sort that issue out).\n\nSo, probably a question for the community more generally and @guozhangwang and @gwenshap immediately: how do we want to handle tests that we're confident are setup properly and useful, but are going to fail while some existing issues are sorted out? I kind of don't want this to sit in limbo (I already did that with the first 5 patches that writing this test resulted in....). On the other hand, committing failing tests is not helpful. We have an `@ignore` decorator, but that disables running the test entirely. @granders and I were discussing an `@unstable` annotation, but I'm not sure how quickly we can get that because making the semantics useful (i.e. actually notifies you of failures, but in a nice way if only unstable tests fail, doesn't require proactively checking test results, doesn't require a bunch of 1-liner commits to remove unstable annotations once the test is stabilized, etc).\n\nThoughts about what to do with this patch in the mean time until those issues are addressed?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154271978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154273107","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/432#issuecomment-154273107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/432","id":154273107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDI3MzEwNw==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T03:18:51Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T03:18:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ewencp It will be a bug if the kick-out-of-group consumer can still commit offsets: their commit should be rejected with ILLEGAL_GENERATION.

So this issue is definitely due to the fact that we have not generalized a mechanism for having the group coordinator manage these types of write/commit operations in a more general manner. I thought about routing all these writes through the leader, but that only reduces, not removes, the issue since the lagging node could be the leader.\n\nRe: tests, yes, I am looking to fix them immediately, so in this case we can defer for a while at least. I guess part of my point is that in general system tests are a lot more finicky than unit tests, so even if it's been reviewed and passes regularly locally, we can still see cases where it fails (especially for new functionality like this!). So even when we think the test is stable, we still might want a mechanism to put it into \"trial mode\" for awhile.

Maybe we could use an `@see` reference under each option in the list?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154546761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154547154","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/441#issuecomment-154547154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/441","id":154547154,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDU0NzE1NA==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T21:28:54Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T21:28:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hachikuji Cool.

I ended up going the \"duplicate\" route, but showing how to avoid actually duplicating the version number by just deferring to the Connector class. I started down the path of using generics to tie the task class to the connector class, but adding them _just_ for that purpose gets messy, leaves you mostly using Tasks in their raw type format, etc.\n\nTo be honest, the more I thought about this, the more I think exposing the version info like this is going to be a stop-gap so we have something useful there, but we're eventually going to want to expose more complete metadata about the connector (e.g. embedding descriptions would be very nice, having a standard way of exposing the set of config options is probably critical to get any sort of reasonable, automatic documentation for connectors). Probably long term we'll just want to wrap version info into that more general metadata.\n\nI started to expose the version in the REST API, but that actually requires going out to the node that's running the connector/task, whereas the current API is just getting config info out of the config topic. I think we'll eventually need to forward these requests, but we haven't figured out how to best handle that yet since only the leader knows the complete assignment of tasks... we'll eventually need to do this for status info too, but in the interest of at least getting versions into the interface so they can be used for other purposes, I didn't want to hold this up while figuring out how to manage forwarding those REST requests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154553752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154555929","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/446#issuecomment-154555929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/446","id":154555929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDU1NTkyOQ==","user":{"login":"wushujames","id":677529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzUyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/677529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames","html_url":"https://github.com/wushujames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T22:03:19Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T22:03:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm going to have to update https://github.com/wushujames/copycat-connector-skeleton with these changes, as well as the changes from KAFKA-2764.\n\nUnfortunately, since I basically copy/pasted the File connector files into my skeleton, there's no \"history\" to show that they originally came from here, and so I'll have to apply the diffs manually to my skeleton.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154555929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/154558675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/446#issuecomment-154558675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/446","id":154558675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDU1ODY3NQ==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T22:14:55Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T22:14:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@wushujames shouldn't be a bit deal, these are pretty minor changes anyway.
