The details about the remaining work\r\n\r\n### Report execution process from one Proxy\r\nWhen one Proxy receives the SQL queries from users, it will evaluate whether to report this query execution status to governance in `ExecuteProcessEngine`. You can find where this class is called to track its flow path.\r\nCurrently, the public functions of `DriverJDBCExecutor` has basically finished the relevant functions, but we still need to finish\r\n- `ExecuteProcessStrategyEvaluator`\r\n- `GovernanceExecuteProcessReporter`\r\n- `RawExecutor` (To initialize the whole job, please refer to `DriverJDBCExecutor`)\r\n- `RawSQLExecutorCallback` (To finish a unit job, referring to `JDBCExecutorCallback`)\r\n- `CalciteRowExecutor`\r\n- Store `ExecuteProcessContext` to `governance` in `RegistryCenter` [1]\r\n\r\n### Query execution process from other Proxies\r\nWhen users execute `show processlist` from another Proxy. This Proxy needs to go into `ShowProcesslistExecutor` to get `ExecuteProcessContext` and return to the user by DB binary protocol. The following target classes are for this part,\r\n- Add judgement in `MySQLAdminExecutorFactory`\r\n- New `ShowProcesslistExecutor` to prepare required data from `governance`.\r\n\r\n### Unit

Therefore a `merge` main definition will contain some of the keywords and some of the child group definitions, and each group definition is made up of its child definitions. \r\nOn the other hand, you can still put all specific definitions in the main clause, which does not have any group definitions.\r\n\r\nWhich one is our best choice? I suppose we need to add another factor, i.e., `SQLStatement`. Suppose we want to visit out some specific `statement`, it is necessary to estimate which type of SQL definition of `g4` file is more reasonable and straightforward for visitors.\r\n\r\nThat's my opinion and hope it can give you some hints for the following issues.\r\n\r\nSecond, actually, a more fitting member putting into `MergeStatement`, I guess, is the `UpdateStatement` containing `setAssignment` and `where`. The reason is that `OracleUpdateStatement` has existed and owned the entire and complete definition about `update set where`. \r\nBut that will make it more challenging to do unit tests. I suggest you can have a try, and if that frustrates you too much, you can put it aside. Yep, it is optional. :)\r\n\r\n@ThanoshanMV \r\nHope you can succeed in GSoC 2021 and learn more from this community.  Also @wgy8283335 and I will provide our mentoring as much as we can.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/801800142/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/801884612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9330#issuecomment-801884612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/9330","id":801884612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTg4NDYxMg==","user":{"login":"bwzhang2011","id":749788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/749788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011","html_url":"https://github.com/bwzhang2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwzhang2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-18T12:26:04Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T12:26:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"any
