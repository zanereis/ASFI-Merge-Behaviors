The loss is always high.\r\nAnd i met some problems:\r\n\r\nProblem1:  \r\nI think we put loss function outside of the Block when using gluon, am i right?\r\nThe net output is N\\*C\\*H\\*W. But my data label is N\\*1\\*H\\*W.\r\n `loss =mx.ndarray.SoftmaxOutput(output, label, multi_output=True)` won't work, if i don't add `multi_output=True`.\r\n\r\nProblem2: How to evaluate the accuracy?

issue is arising because coreml converter uses older model api in order to work with mxnet models. The gluon model is saved in a file format which seems incompatible with that of the model api. There are two aspects of this problem. One: should model api be intelligent enough to load the gluon model (and/or vice-versa)? Secondly, how to make coreml converter be able to convert gluon models?\r\n\r\nFor first, I see the need for a wider discussion. Depending on the outcome, we can figure out the right way for the second.\r\n\r\nTo make problems a bit more tricky:\r\n- when gluon saves the checkpoint/symbol, it doesn't store the softmax layer and it needs to be explicitly added.\r\n- gluon's parameter's file don't explicitly call out aux vs args difference which the model api relies on.\r\n\r\nWill try to create a github issue with wider discussion around it.
