I could get 291eac5 and let the test fail and then try to find out what to change in the project modules to make the test pass. I may take a look, but I haven't written that code, so I am not going to have much advantage.\r\n\r\nYes, that's the case. If you get that commit the ```org.netbeans.modules.gradle.java.classpath.GradleSourcesImplTest,testSourceProviderChange()``` testcase will fail.\r\n\r\nWell, it is either the ProjectServiceProvider's Lazy Lookup is wrong or the ProxyLookup does. The LazyLookup might wrongly assume that the beforeLookup() would be called in every case when it's content being queried, or the ProxyLookup does not fullfill that contract in every case.\r\n\r\nIt worked so far well in NetBeans as the dynamic nature of ProxyLookup was rarely used. So if plugins register ProjectServiceProvider on the main project type. then it works as initially the LazyLookups on some code path got initialized.\r\n\r\nMaven Plugin has a dynamic nature based on the packaging type, so services can be registered on war, osgi, and jar packaging type explicitly. There are only a few, maybe less than 5, such registration occurs in the codebase. They are not used by mergers, and eventually get initialized on some other code paths (I haven't explored them deeply though.)\r\n\r\nGradle Support is a bit different, as planned to allow plugin based ProjectServiceProvider registration. So simple aggregator root project of a multi-project build would not have all the Java bells and whistles in its lookup. But the most common use case is when the user opens a project in NetBeans, that time it is only some heuristics used in order to avoid the immediate turn to Gradle.

And the question is: If there are merge conflicts: Why are they there? Where are the differing commits?\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nYes the merge commits are a problem, because cherry-pick applies the changes, but merge pulls two branches together, which branch should cherry-pick as a basis for the merge? This is the reason I like to cleanup after doing a messy PR and compress the 17 intermediate commits into one or two meaning full commits, that makes it much easier to deal with history changes like this. But you can work around that by specifying the commits from the branches you merged, that is already the case here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n887f6b6446a6 Merge pull request #2554 from jlahoda/fix-java.lsp.server-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nmerged \r\n\r\n```\r\na3101ebbb48e Fixing java/java.lsp.server tests.\r\n```\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nFor the huge number of conflicts, I suspect the problem is, that the order of the commits is reversed. The first entry in your list is the most recent, while cherry-pick needs the \"right\" order or commits.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/753283108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/753293113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2626#issuecomment-753293113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2626","id":753293113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzI5MzExMw==","user":{"login":"JaroslavTulach","id":26887752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODg3NzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26887752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach","html_url":"https://github.com/JaroslavTulach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaroslavTulach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-01T09:33:58Z","updated_at":"2021-01-01T09:43:24Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Re. order: My script is using `tac` instead of `cat` to reverse the order of commits.

ready to review. Licenses and formatting will be corrected in next commit. \r\n\r\nPlease focus on NB API changes - I moved some functionality from `org.netbeans.api.progress.nb` to `org.netbeans.api.progress`: the reason is that some features that are of interest of LSP clients use default action that \"only\" uses some cookies or API, and is not strictly visual. There's a chance that such action can be (in the future) reflected back to the LSP protocol and client. Short term, this allowed to capture progress from Maven, Gradle and others.\r\n\r\nShort overview:\r\n- Default (view) action support APIs moved to `org.netbeans.api.progress`\r\n- The message wrapper in LSP `Server` interprets `workDoneProgressToken` in request messages, so potential ProgressHandles connect back to a token that is issued by the LSP client\r\n- The wrapper handles centrally `workDoneCancel` message by cancelling ProgressHandle on behalf of the client.\r\n- `OperationContext` is present in the default lookup (and is propagated through spawned `RequestProcessor.Task`s), ProgressHandle creation works with that to connect back to the client and issue tokens.\r\n- LSP `InternalHandle` implementation sends notification on start, progress and finish events\r\n\r\nI adapted certain NB usages of Progress API to use just the basic API, and removed dependencies on Swing-specific implementation, when possible.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/755217635/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/755474808","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2609#issuecomment-755474808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2609","id":755474808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTQ3NDgwOA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-06T18:23:30Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T18:23:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks sane to me - aligning with upstream sounds like a good idea.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/755474808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/755556992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2635#issuecomment-755556992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2635","id":755556992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTU1Njk5Mg==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-06T19:25:44Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T19:25:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good to me.

why the tests are different: the testsuite actually makes **one LSP connection per test case**. In our view of how the `Source` cache should behave for a LSP server, all those clients (e.g. multiple `vscode` instances) would share the cache: at the end of the day, requests to the same `FileObject` will point to the same place on the disk, so the project environment is the same (well, hypothetically two clients with different sets of libraries or JDK requirements may come in, but the LSP server is far from such complexities).\r\n\r\nI've even prototyped such global cache for `Source` objects, see https://github.com/sdedic/incubator-netbeans/tree/prototype/lsp-client-session-sources: all the `Source` objects received the true global `Lookup` as their context. But it turned out, that some code in NetBeans still invokes `Source.create()` without any context information, thus passing the effective request-specfic Lookup to the factory (which is OK), and compares *that specific Lookup* to the returned Source's context ... which is a bug.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, the check should have checked whether the returned `Source`'s contex is  is \"compatible\" (allowed, ..) in the calling context. And Parsing API simply does not have information to do that check - pure identity check is far too strict.\r\n\r\nUff.\r\nSo many words for a one-liner
