A FileSystem-like API would give users some familiarity in working with the LogService, but the general feeling was that we may be over-burdening ourselves in the first implementation. There would be many things we could potentially implement via a FileSystem like API which we wouldn't necessarily need for HBase as an initial consumer.\r\n\r\nI think we could explore using a FileSystem-like API in the future to supplement a more minimal core API (closer to what is here already).

I could see us integrating the Ratis LogService into HBase via a FileSystem facade.\r\n\r\nHow do you feel about that, @VladRodionov?
