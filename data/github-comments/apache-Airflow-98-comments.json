I recall other strange behaviors in these log lines too (maybe something like Try 4/3).\r\n- The \"primary key\" for a task instance run is not complete (which is what Allison's logging change needs), you could say that TaskInstance should only keep track of the latest TaskInstance run, but we still want to store all tries for a task instance somewhere in the database, and we still need to key this off of \"attempt\".\r\n```\r\nI don't like start_dates, there aren't really guarantees around them being completely unique (which try_number gives us for free), they are a poor approximation for a unique key.

These costs may be preferable depending on the scenario/environment. Starting a task can have significant overhead depending on the size of the DAG and other factors that depend on the executor. Say for the upcoming Kubernetes executor, startup may include booting up a docker instance and doing a shallow clone of the repo.\r\n\r\nSince this is a major change, I would argue that we shouldn't change the current default since organizations have provisioned and stabilized their environments based on the current behavior. Default behavior could be changed when moving to `2.0`, which isn't really planned or scheduled at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnother idea around reducing the overall sensor slot utilization would be to move that burden towards the scheduler (let's call it the supervisor now since it does more than just scheduling at this point). My idea there was to add a flag to `BaseSensorOperator` that would tell the scheduler to run the poke method in line with the scheduling instead of using the executor. In that scenario, there's no startup cost and no communication overhead. The downside is that it can slow down the scheduler. This would be a great option where sensing is cheap and fast\r\n\r\nThat gives us potentially 3 `sensor_mode`s, which I would argue should be implemented as a BaseOperator feature. Derivative classes can decide to expose the argument or force it. Administrator can also use the `policy` function to force certain sensing mode in certain or all contexts in their environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/318723842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/318742133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2476#issuecomment-318742133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2476","id":318742133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODc0MjEzMw==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T19:28:26Z","updated_at":"2017-07-29T10:03:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#2476](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/547f8184be1e0b3f902faf354fa39579d2f08af2?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476/graphs/tree.svg?height=150&src=pr&token=WdLKlKHOAU&width=650)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@          Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master   #2476   +/-   ##\n======================================\n  Coverage    69.5%   69.5%           \n======================================\n  Files         146     146           \n  Lines       11391   11391           \n======================================\n  Hits         7917    7917           \n  Misses       3474    3474\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [airflow/operators/sensors.py](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YWlyZmxvdy9vcGVyYXRvcnMvc2Vuc29ycy5weQ==) | `67.36% <100%> (ø)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2476?src=pr&el=footer).

Or did something else delay execution?  (Worker issue?)  Usually the former, but you have to dig to know for sure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/318761959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/318772064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2486#issuecomment-318772064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2486","id":318772064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODc3MjA2NA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T22:02:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T22:02:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bolkedebruin would like your feedback here as well","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/318772064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/318779240","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2486#issuecomment-318779240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2486","id":318779240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODc3OTI0MA==","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T22:48:24Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T22:48:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Use case for this, btw, is sometimes we have an outage with a downstream system (e.g. Google Cloud Storage/BigQuery), and we get 100s of DAG failures in the span of a few minutes.

Although since it provides most of standard ftp functions in its sftp implementation ( ex: getCWD() ), we can create wrapper functions in SFTPOperator, if the compatibility and easy switching between ftp and sftp is needed. That would be a separate change though and out of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nThe problem is then standardize the semantics of a hook and an operator. This has been in fact confusing for me when I started using Airflow.\r\nI am tempted to rework both FTP and SFTP functionality but that implies another change of mindset for those using one or the other because we have now a FTPHook providing some needed functionality (and managing such FTP connection), and then a SFTPOperator providing some other functionality in a different way (for example, the get/put 'methods').\r\nAnd as many said they would like to be able to have similar interfaces (for example, in the scenario of moving from FTP to SFTP).\r\nPersonally listing the contents of a directory is key for our work (we list, filter based on some rules, and then retrieve some subset of the list of files depending on those rules).\r\n\r\nI am happy to put a PR with our custom changes on this but I wonder if this would be ok with the Airflow maintainers and @jhsenjaliya?
