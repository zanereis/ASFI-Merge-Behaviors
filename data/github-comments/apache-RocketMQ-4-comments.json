yes, I think we have to discuss it in the dev mailing list :+1: \r\nI think having a class/methods for wire protocol version checking and applying them (and, as a result, accepting or rejecting) when a client wants to establish a connection to a broker, etc. should work. I guess that's what you meant by having \"checking codes in one place\" :)\r\nThe version information can be placed into headers.\r\n\r\nSuch protocol changes shouldn't happen that often (RocketMQ v.4.0.0, v.4.1.0 may use protocol v.1, but RocketMQ v.5.0.0 may use protocol v.2), but if they happen, in this way we can guarantee that the communication between system components is done correctly.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss it in the ml.

\r\n\r\nI have the same wishes for batch send too, but what drives me is that user may propably need a batch id for one batch of message, and these message should be success all to one single queue, which is nessecary when sneding order message. say msgA msgB and msgC should be consumed in order, they should be send to one same queue, but if we use for loop to send this, A may success and B may fail to the same queue since the queue numbers may changes at that exct sending time.\r\n\r\nBatch send could solve this problem. But we may also need to generate a uniq batch id for this in client, which will help us to optimze the performance of consumeorderlyservice in the furture. Currently, message in one single queue can only be consumed only if the previous one consumed successfully which actually is too strict. Actully we only need the message in one batch consumed in order, batch id will help us to do this.\r\n\r\n**So in general, I suggest adding batch id  when sending batch message in all message property.**\r\n\r\nPS: There looks like two many repeated code, any ways or plans to clean it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/280245615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/280245626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/63#issuecomment-280245626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/63","id":280245626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDI0NTYyNg==","user":{"login":"lizhanhui","id":641819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/lizhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lizhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-16T06:43:44Z","updated_at":"2017-02-16T06:43:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This issue is valid and the bug will be triggered under the following conditions:\r\n1.

Setting too aggressive a goal indicates that you are willing to bear an increase in garbage collection overhead, which has a direct impact on throughput. When you evaluate the G1 GC for latency, you set your desired (soft) real-time goal, and the G1 GC will try to meet it.
