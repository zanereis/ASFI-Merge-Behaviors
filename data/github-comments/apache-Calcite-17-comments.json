It is just a good general-purpose implementation. If it doesn't meet your needs, you can create your own.\r\n\r\nNo sub-classes in Calcite use the `stack` field, but it's there, and it is potentially useful, if I am looking for say a `Filter` within a `Project` within a `Filter`.\r\n\r\nConsider `AbstractList` class in the JDK.
