Are we OK with that?\r\n\r\nI did identify the addition and was okay with it given the following:\r\n- it was constrained to test dependencies\r\n- it was constrained to a single module\r\n- it seemed benign\r\n\r\nI didn't know about the ability to do content filtering or I would have asked that it was included.  However, if many others have a strong aversion, we can revert. What do we think we should suggest people do in this kind of situation? Especially in this situation where new functionality isn't being added here which sources a new repo, instead existing dependency jars have moved to a new repo.\r\n\r\n> Category X license\r\n\r\nI didn't realize that the ES license change was in a minor version (sigh). That being said, I don't see a problem with this patch. We already depend on category X licenses for build/test (JMH is an example, I believe) and this is consistent with ASF policies. Category X are prohibited in source releases and convenience binaries and I don't believe this change introduces any violation of that. As I understand it, the rest client we depend on for non-test code remains ASL2.0 licensed (only the \"highlevel\" library moved to the category X licenses: [ll license](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/_license.html), [ll-hl distinction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62340904/elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client-vs-elasticsearch-rest-client)).\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n- This seemed like a relatively innocuous change which is why I merged it. If there is a strong discomfort to the inclusion of a new repository (even at this constrained level), we can revert this and ask the contributor to find an alternative path.\r\n- If we are uncomfortable using category X licenses in the ES test module, we should probably remove ES as a supported adapter and either deprecate entirely or move to the AWS opensearch fork.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/996854742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/996869051","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2622#issuecomment-996869051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2622","id":996869051,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM47awO7","user":{"login":"vlsi","id":213894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzg5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi","html_url":"https://github.com/vlsi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlsi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-17T16:50:05Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T16:50:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> We already depend on category X licenses for build/test (JMH is an example, I believe) \r\n\r\nJMH is GPL with classpath exception, and that is explicitly allowed.

In this particular case, at first glance, these methods don't seem out-of-date / useless in my opinion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1011176969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1011178544","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2688#issuecomment-1011178544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2688","id":1011178544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM48RVww","user":{"login":"xuzifu666","id":10645422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ1NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10645422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666","html_url":"https://github.com/xuzifu666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T15:44:14Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T15:50:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> CI/CD won't necessarily break if you remove them, they might be unused _within_ Calcite, but they can be very well used by Calcite users, removing them might break their code.\r\n> \r\n> What others suggested, going through a `@Deprecated` annotation is what we generally do.\r\n> \r\n> However, it would be good to at least comment on why some methods are deprecated, and what to use instead in order to achieve the same goal, if possible (e.g., multiple versions of a constructor for a given class).\r\n\r\nok, these methods can be used by normal non agrs constructor to build, do not need to provided with a specified method，according  to design patterns the way of providing a method which is not used in project internally is not perfect.add a deprecated annotation to remind user not use these method is a way to improve Calcite code in next versions. the case also in other project, they use the same way to remind users about it. @asolimando @rubenada \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1011178544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1011931509","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2688#issuecomment-1011931509","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2688","id":1011931509,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM48UNl1","user":{"login":"xuzifu666","id":10645422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ1NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10645422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666","html_url":"https://github.com/xuzifu666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T09:02:09Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T09:02:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"hi, i change add @SuppressWarnings to these methods. do you aggree with me?
