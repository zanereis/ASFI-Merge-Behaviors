If checkpointing is turned off, not only the number of queued messages will grow unbounded, but also the messages will never be acknowledged. In terms of RabbitMQ that means that messages will be kept in the broker forever and will be redelivered once another consumer connects to the queue again.\n\nIn terms of exactly once, I'm not 100% sure how we can support it. I think we have to default to per-message acknowledgments (instead of acknowledging all ids <= the last processed id). Only that way we can make sure that upon failure we acknowledge the right messages. The reason for that is that distribution of the messages may not be the same after a redeployment of a failed job, i.e. consumers may receive messages that have not seen the message beforehand, thus a message may be processed more than once.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/160141917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/160146335","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1243#issuecomment-160146335","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1243","id":160146335,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDE0NjMzNQ==","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T14:05:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T14:05:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm creating a unit test for the source which mocks the RabbitMQ classes.

For example, if you wrote:\n\n```\nselect(a.count, b.count)\n```\n\nthe resulting expansion would be\n\n```\nintermediate = select(1.count as intermediate.1)\nagg = intermediate.aggregate(intermediate.1, sum)\nresult = agg.select(intermediate.1, intermediate.1)\n```\n\nYou see, the `1` would only be aggregated once here.\n\nThe problem was that selecting `intermediate.1` twice is not allowed since the field names have to be unique.\n\nChanging `ExpandAggregations` to this should do the trick:\n\n```\nvar intermediateCount = 0\nvar resultCount = 0\nselection foreach {  f =>\n  f.transformPre {\n    case agg: Aggregation =>\n      val intermediateReferences = agg.getIntermediateFields.zip(agg.getAggregations) map {\n        case (expr, basicAgg) =>\n          aggregations.get((expr, basicAgg)) match {\n            case Some(intermediateName) =>\n              resultCount = resultCount + 1\n              val resultName = s\"result.$resultCount\"\n              Naming(ResolvedFieldReference(intermediateName, expr.typeInfo), resultName)\n            case None =>\n              intermediateCount = intermediateCount + 1\n              val intermediateName = s\"intermediate.$intermediateCount\"\n              intermediateFields += Naming(expr, intermediateName)\n              aggregations((expr, basicAgg)) = intermediateName\n              resultCount = resultCount + 1\n              val resultName = s\"result.$resultCount\"\n              Naming(ResolvedFieldReference(intermediateName, expr.typeInfo), resultName)\n          }\n      }\n\n      aggregationIntermediates(agg) = intermediateReferences\n      // Return a NOP so that we don't add the children of the aggregation\n      // to intermediate fields. We already added the necessary fields to the list\n      // of intermediate fields.\n      NopExpression()\n\n    case fa: ResolvedFieldReference =>\n      if (!fa.name.startsWith(\"intermediate\")) {\n        intermediateFields += Naming(fa, fa.name)\n      }\n      fa\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow the aggregations will be expanded to:\n\n```\nintermediate = select(1.count as intermediate.1)\nagg = intermediate.aggregate(intermediate.1, sum)\nresult = agg.select(intermediate.1 as result.1, intermediate.1 as result.2)\n```\n\nThis also required changing `ExpressionCodeGenerator.scala`, line 111 to:\n\n```\ndef cleanExpr(e: Expression): Expression = {\n  e match {\n    case expressions.Naming(namedExpr, _) => cleanExpr(namedExpr)\n    case _ => e\n  }\n}\n```\n\nbecause there is another bug that doesn't allow having nested Namings à la `Naming(Naming(expr, intermediate.1, result.1))`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/160153032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/160153085","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1414#issuecomment-160153085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1414","id":160153085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDE1MzA4NQ==","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T14:45:20Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T14:45:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's good that you found the problem and added a test. :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/160153085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/160155150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1415#issuecomment-160155150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1415","id":160155150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDE1NTE1MA==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T14:58:52Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T14:58:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm wondering whether we could encapsulate the added functionality into a separate method to avoid code duplication?

@danielblazevski, I reviewed your updated pull request. There are only few problems to merge. Maybe after addressing them, we can merge this to master.\n\nFirst, there are still some codes with style inconsistency. Could you reformat all changes with your IDE? If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can do reformatting by pressing Cmd+Alt+Shift+L or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L.\n\nAbout test case for `QuadTree`, adding a case to test `QuadTree` with non-supported distance metric would be good. And I think splitting test case is necessary. Many test run in a test case currently.\n\nSome implementation doesn't seem scalaesque. I suggest more scalaesque implementation.
