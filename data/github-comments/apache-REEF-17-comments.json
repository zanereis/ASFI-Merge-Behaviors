done a pass over the logic of this. It seems correct, but I wonder about how we represent racks here. We basically assume that there is a fixed set of racks, and that racks are a one level hierarchy: Within each rack, there are machines and machines host containers. That isn't able to reflect certain topologies as they might come up with federated YARN clusters.\n\nMaybe we can represent the racks and machines in a single-root namespace. For example `/rack5/machine3` or `/california-data-center/room1a/rack4/machine1`. If we allow for asterisks at the end of such a path, we can capture relaxed locality. And lists of such paths (with or without asterisks at the end) form the priority of a request.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nOn the code side, this employs mutable state (`allocated`) and quite a few jumps (`break`, `continue`). I wonder whether we could instead do a more functional approach: Instead of trying all racks in a loop that also performs the allocation, we could have a method in `ContainerManager` that returns the first rack with availability, given the priority list. We can then proceed with that (immutable) rack name to send an allocation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/116774172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/116774799","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/252#issuecomment-116774799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/252","id":116774799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjc3NDc5OQ==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-29T17:53:16Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T17:53:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Is there a rule against `public static` without `final`?
