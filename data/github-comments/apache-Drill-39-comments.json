What we are trying to accomplish here is use real data to figure out the memory needed. Before, we would use standard size of 50 for varchar, which can differ from average actual varchar column size (could be by a big factor).  Typically, within a column, data will be around the same size and that could differ from standard size we are using by a big factor. What we are trying to optimize here is for accounting for that factor. In my opinion, distribution you are referring to is not applicable here. Also, assuming that data will be more or less evenly distributed across partitions, again, I believe stating that 50% of the batches will be more than average and 50% less than average is also wrong. \r\n\r\nSince we are calculating batch size upfront, emitting partial batches and keeping track of all that is unnecessary complication that can be avoided. I don't think it will provide much benefit. \r\n\r\nAllowing the HashAgg operator to decrease the output batch size configured by the user - Yes, that we have to do. In fact, that is the problem I am having with hash join right now which is causing hash join to spill.

These change eliminate quite a bit of useless computation. Is there any need/plan to allow concurrent access to the RecordBatchSizer in the future? With these changes, access to the RecordBatchSizer will have more synchronization points for concurrent access. Earlier, ouputRowCount was the only field that was mutated after creating a RecordBatch object. Now many more fields are being changed.  I just wanted to raise that one point.

The issue is that some information needed to be logged for QA purposes on a per query basis, and for ease of testing needed to be toggled from the sqlline. This was the agreed on approach by the batch sizing team, so at this point we're coming in at the end of a series of discussions. Nevertheless I spent about half a day to find a way this use case could be met in a logback centric way, and I could not find a reasonable alternative that could be done without a large amount of work.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that slf4j / logback has global logging configurations, which makes it impossible to turn on logging on a per query bases. We can use MDC to include a query id in the log messages and we could filter by query, but even that is not ideal since you are generating logs you don't need for all queries. Then there is the issue of updating the logging configuration. The only logback native method is to enable periodic scanning of the logback.xml file and to update the logback.xml file on all nodes when you want to enable certain logging. That is not a great experience for someone automating tests, or debugging.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion we came to was that Drill needs a real logging solution, and to really do it right you would have to go down the rabbit hole.\r\n\r\n  1. Enable per query logging configurations, not just a global logging configuration. To do this we would have to use thread local loggers instead of static loggers, or something like https://clogr.io/, or a custom ContextSelector https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38208617/practical-use-of-logback-context-selectors.\r\n  2. Allow either sql line configuration of log levels or web ui configuration of log levels (like Apex had).\r\n  3. Include a logging context with the query context to communicate the logging config for a query.\r\n\r\nThese are non trivial, have a lot of corner cases, and require design discussions with the community.\r\n\r\nFor the interim Salim is making the options controlling logging internal, so users will not see them. Then he is going to have a follow up PR to consolidate the logging across all the batch sizing operators. Later when we have a real logging solution we can delete these options and do the right thing.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/401424230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/401424556","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1350#issuecomment-401424556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1350","id":401424556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTQyNDU1Ng==","user":{"login":"agirish","id":2224090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2224090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish","html_url":"https://github.com/agirish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T17:41:09Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T17:41:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@arina-ielchiieva, I thought about that - but it's a bit more complicated in how i'd like it to be: An \"Export All\" button\" should export each of the storage plugin configurations into JSON files and generate a single compressed folder which contains each of these JSON files individually. \r\nAnd an \"Import\" button which can support importing either a single JSON file or a compressed folder which can create one or more storage plugins. \r\n\r\nI think having individual export button is helpful.

QA has setup automatic tests of both the performance of batch sizing as well as correctness on a real cluster. Each batch sizing change has unit tests to validate batch size. But on a real cluster with real data, the only viable way to validate right now for QA is to check the batch sizes output by an operator is through logging. Since Drill takes testing on real clusters seriously and aims to do more than just unit tests, I think this is perfectly acceptable.\r\n\r\nSince logging has overhead, and QA wanted to automate both the performance and correctness tests, they required the ability to turn logging off via sql line. This was the approach agreed on by developers and testers in the Drill community including @sachouche, @bitblender, @ppadma, robert (don't know his github id), and @priteshm.\r\n\r\nGiven the scope of agreement in the community, the fact that similar changes have already been merged, and also to minor impact on the drill code itself ~20 lines; I suggest moving this discussion to a separate change. In my investigation I was not able to find a viable alternative to this approach, @vrozov perhaps you could present an alternative approach on the dev list and lead the proposal. It would be a great help moving forward.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the changes proposed here represent a valuable performance improvement for the Drill community, so let's not hold up this change over this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/401453225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/401466019","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1348#issuecomment-401466019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1348","id":401466019,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTQ2NjAxOQ==","user":{"login":"agirish","id":2224090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2224090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish","html_url":"https://github.com/agirish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agirish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T20:30:54Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T20:30:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I'll work on adding the instructions into both the docs dir on this repo and the write-up on Parth's repo once the PR is in.
