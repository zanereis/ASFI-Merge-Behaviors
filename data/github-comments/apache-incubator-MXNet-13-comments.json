is an outline how it can be done, because there is no additional dependency besides blas, it should be quite identical to what was given\n- [ ] Use the amalgamation script https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/amalgamation to create a C library\n- [ ] Find a blas library in IOS, openblas or other blas, to link and create a C library `libmxnet_predict.so`\n- [ ] Create a swift/object-c wrapper, that calls https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/include/mxnet/c_predict_api.h\n  - The call is only a foreign C call, so should be easy for both language\n  - You can ref other wrappers such as https://github.com/jdeng/gomxnet/ on how to call C API\n- You  should be good to

\n\nJust come back from the exam and fix this (see #560 ). Actually it is a very simple problem. We met an inconsistency of dimensions between R and the backend.\n\nNow you should have something like below:\n\n``` r\n> library(mxnet)\n> data(BostonHousing, package=\"mlbench\")\n> train.ind = seq(1, 506, 3)\n> train.x = data.matrix(BostonHousing[train.ind, -14])\n> train.y = BostonHousing[train.ind, 14]\n> test.x = data.matrix(BostonHousing[-train.ind, -14])\n> test.y = BostonHousing[-train.ind, 14]\n> data <- mx.symbol.Variable(\"data\")\n> fc1 <- mx.symbol.FullyConnected(data, num_hidden=1)\n> lro <- mx.symbol.LinearRegressionOutput(fc1)\n> mx.set.seed(0)\n> model <- mx.model.FeedForward.create(\n+   lro, X=train.x, y=train.y,\n+   ctx=mx.cpu(), num.round=50, array.batch.size=20,\n+   learning.rate=2e-6, momentum=0.9, eval.metric=mx.metric.rmse)\nAuto detect layout of input matrix, use rowmajor..\nStart training with 1 devices\n[1] Train-rmse=16.063282524034\n[2] Train-rmse=12.2792375712573\n[3] Train-rmse=11.1984634005885\n[4]

Plus sometimes we also need to consider the usage of GPU memory. \n\nHowever, if you have different GPUs, I would suggest the following strategy to adjust your `work_load` assignment. \n1. `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` to closely watch the usage of your GPUs. \n2. If you observe some GPU's `Volatile GPU-Util` periodically drop to 0% and then goes back to 99%. That means this GPU is waiting others to calculate and synchronize. So you need to add some work load to that GPU. \n3.
