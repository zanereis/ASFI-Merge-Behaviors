If I understand you correctly. you want delete the code which you mentioned above. But I'm afraid we can not delete that code. Because when output type is `PojoTypeInfo`,the column index are out of order. I think we really need that code. Can you double check it And Please feedback me?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSunJincheng","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/308347480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/308360111","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/3838#issuecomment-308360111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/3838","id":308360111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODM2MDExMQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-14T08:27:16Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T08:27:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm gonna take a deeper look now, and play around with it a bit.\r\n\r\nBe aware that if you rebase the branch again you will hit a myriad of checkstyle violations, we will have to suppress the checks for method names for this module.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/308360111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/308362664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4104#issuecomment-308362664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4104","id":308362664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODM2MjY2NA==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-14T08:36:10Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T08:36:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This should be the same code as #4055 because the windows should not have changed on the `master` branch since the release right?\r\nIf that's the case, I'm +1 for merging as well.\r\n\r\nbtw. we usually do not open separate PRs for different branches (unless there is backporting required due to changes on `master` branch).

first thought I had to downgrade, because of the aforementioned problem. However, Hadoop 2.8.0 needs at least httpclient `4.5.2`. Luckily, they fixed the problem with the `URLEncodedUtils#parse` method in `4.5.3`. Therefore I bumped the version again.\r\n\r\nConcerning moving the dependency management to `flink-shaded-hadoop`: I think this is unfortunately not possible since due the immutable reactor builds from maven, `flink-yarn-tests` pulls all dependencies from `flink-shaded-hadoop` and `flink-shaded-yarn-tests`. This also means that depending on the classpath order, we either use the shaded Yarn mini-cluster or not. In the latter case we have to make sure that we are using `httpclient` `4.5.3` which is only the case if we define the dependency management in the parent pom (or duplicate it in the `flink-yarn-tests` pom file).\r\n\r\nAs a side remark, given this situation with maven, I'm not sure whether we actually need the `flink-shaded-yarn-tests` module.\r\n\r\nA proper solution would be fixing the problem with the immutable builds. For example, everything works properly if we first install the shaded jars and then build the flink-yarn-tests. Then maven will properly resolve all dependencies. In this case, I think it should be possible to move the dependency management into `flink-shaded-hadoop`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/308683003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/308707321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/4125#issuecomment-308707321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/4125","id":308707321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODcwNzMyMQ==","user":{"login":"rice668","id":6520673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjA2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6520673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668","html_url":"https://github.com/rice668","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rice668/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-15T11:45:11Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T11:45:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @zentol .
