Because AWS sometimes terminates VMs, we sometimes lose a Zookeeper instance.  When this happens, the hostname cannot be resolved for that zookeeper instance as AWS has taken the VM away.  We noticed that in this case storm fails to connect to zookeeper – even though there are still 2 Zookeeper instances running.  It fails with an exception something like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"preformatted panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"preformattedContent panelContent\">\n<pre>java.net.UnknownHostException: zookeeper3\n  at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName0(InetAddress.java:1280) \n  at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1192) \n  at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1126) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.zookeeper.client.StaticHostProvider.<init>(StaticHostProvider.java:61) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.<init>(ZooKeeper.java:445) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.utils.DefaultZookeeperFactory.newZooKeeper(DefaultZookeeperFactory.java:29) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl$2.newZooKeeper(CuratorFrameworkImpl.java:150) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.HandleHolder$1.getZooKeeper(HandleHolder.java:94) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.HandleHolder.getZooKeeper(HandleHolder.java:55) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.ConnectionState.reset(ConnectionState.java:218) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.ConnectionState.start(ConnectionState.java:103) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.CuratorZookeeperClient.start(CuratorZookeeperClient.java:190) \n  at org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.curator.framework.imps.CuratorFrameworkImpl.start(CuratorFrameworkImpl.java:259) \n  at org.apache.storm.zookeeper$mk_client.doInvoke(zookeeper.clj:86) \n  at clojure.lang.RestFn.invoke(RestFn.java:494)\n  at org.apache.storm.cluster_state.zookeeper_state_factory$_mkState.invoke(zookeeper_state_factory.clj:28) \n  at org.apache.storm.cluster_state.zookeeper_state_factory.mkState(Unknown Source) \n  <SNIP REST OF STACKTRACE>\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>Having done some research it looks like this error is caused by a bug in the Zookeeper client library.  There is an issue for it here:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1576\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1576</a><br/>\nThis issue has been resolved in the version 3.5.x branch of Zookeeper.  However, after 2.5 years and 3 releases the 3.5.x branch of Zookeeper is still in Alpha <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/sad.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that it is in alpha, there is a branch of Curator (v.3.x.x) that uses it, but Storm uses Curator version 2.x.x – possibly because it doesn’t rely on alpha code.  So the bug is still unpatched in Storm.</p>\n\n<p>I realise that an upgrade to alpha code may be too much of a risk, but this problem is a serious issue for those running Storm on AWS (and presumably other cloud providers) - so perhaps it may be worth considering?</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612977536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/282068668","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1951#issuecomment-282068668","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1951","id":282068668,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjA2ODY2OA==","user":{"login":"SreeramGarlapati","id":11813428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODEzNDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11813428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati","html_url":"https://github.com/SreeramGarlapati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SreeramGarlapati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T17:54:31Z","updated_at":"2017-02-23T17:54:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":":clock1:","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/282068668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612980820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/6101#issuecomment-2612980820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/6101","id":2612980820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI5ODA4MjA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-23T18:58:16Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:55:19Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a
