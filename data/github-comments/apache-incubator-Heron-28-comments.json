This change caused a pretty significant performance degradation (30% or so) in our topologies. The reason is kind of interesting.\n\nIn our case we are using kafka which uses log4j directly. `log4j-over-slf4j` replaces all of the `log4j` methods and routes them through `slf4j` so that they can be dispatched to another logger. When this dependency was removed it caused that to no longer be the case. Heron was setting the log level to `INFO` for `slf4j` which also ended up setting the `log4j` level to `INFO` as well. When the dependency was removed this was no longer the case because the two logging mechanisms were separated. `log4j` defaults to a log level of DEBUG which meant that kafka (and other dependencies in a worse way for some other topologies) started to output all of their debug log to essentially /dev/null because it is the default for `log4j`. So we could not see the increase in log messages in our heron logs and had to profile the topology when it was in a bad state vs a good state to see that kafka was spending a tremendous amount of time logging out debug messages.\n\nI think we should consider adding this dependency back in to align all of the logging to the same place, otherwise we could have multiple loggers writing to different places on different log levels which can be very confusing and is not apparent without some pretty serious digging.\n\nThe message that you put in the description of this issue happens in our topologies as well but does not have any impact on the runtime of the topology. My feeling is a simple log message about multiple bindings is far better than accidentally turning on debug mode for any dependency that uses `log4j` explicitly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/239014852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/239018714","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/620#issuecomment-239018714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/620","id":239018714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTAxODcxNA==","user":{"login":"ashvina","id":10034060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM0MDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10034060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina","html_url":"https://github.com/ashvina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashvina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-10T22:02:17Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T22:02:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @ajorgensen Thanks for the details\n\nThe issue reported is not a ignorable log message.

I don't agree with you the `log4j-over-slf4j` is a topology dependency. You are running topology code inside the heron runtime it should be heron's responsibility to configure how that logging works. I also do not agree that it would be better if log4j should be configured separately, it would potentially break the linking between the heron logs and the ui in a way that is not immediately apparent.\n\nAdditionally the failure case for not including `log4j-over-slf4j` is _much_ worse than the failure case for including it. If any dependency uses log4j directly it will silently start spewing DEBUG logging information which depending on the dependency can cause serious performance degradations in the topology without any indication as to why. In order to figure out what was causing the problem I had to profile the app and go through the call tree to see that kafka was spending a lot of time writing debug information.\n\nI think that if you are running your code inside someone else's runtime (Hadoop, Heron, Storm, etc) that it is their responsibility to configure the logging system to do the right thing.\n\n`slf4j` is supposed to be a facade that allows you to write code against a common interface and then the place where you are running the code can configure how that information gets logged out. The runtime decides what logging system it wants to use and configures it accordingly, if you only include `slf4j-api` or use `log4j` directly this just works its when dependencies start including `log4j-over-slf4j` or `slf4j-log4j12` directly and configuring logging that this breaks down because the runtime is suddenly not able to make the decisions it needs to to work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/239265634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/239295141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1243#issuecomment-239295141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1243","id":239295141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTI5NTE0MQ==","user":{"login":"maosongfu","id":3028698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjg2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3028698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu","html_url":"https://github.com/maosongfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maosongfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-11T21:16:00Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T21:16:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"According to the container_1_g_6.log.0, it is a known issue:\n\n```\n[2016-08-10 16:10:01 -0700] com.twitter.heron.instance.HeronInstance SEVERE:  Exception caught in thread: SlaveThread with id: 13 \njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/esotericsoftware/reflectasm/ConstructorAccess\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo$DefaultInstantiatorStrategy.newInstantiatorOf(Kryo.java:1233)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo.newInstantiator(Kryo.java:1078)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo.newInstance(Kryo.java:1087)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.serializers.CollectionSerializer.create(CollectionSerializer.java:107)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.serializers.CollectionSerializer.read(CollectionSerializer.java:111)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.serializers.CollectionSerializer.read(CollectionSerializer.java:40)\n    at com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Kryo.readClassAndObject(Kryo.java:793)\n    at com.twitter.heron.api.serializer.KryoSerializer.deserialize(KryoSerializer.java:49)\n    at com.twitter.heron.instance.bolt.BoltInstance.handleDataTuple(BoltInstance.java:170)\n    at com.twitter.heron.instance.bolt.BoltInstance.readTuplesAndExecute(BoltInstance.java:217)\n    at com.twitter.heron.instance.bolt.BoltInstance$1.run(BoltInstance.java:142)\n    at com.twitter.heron.common.basics.WakeableLooper.executeTasksOnWakeup(WakeableLooper.java:142)\n    at com.twitter.heron.common.basics.WakeableLooper.runOnce(WakeableLooper.java:74)\n    at com.twitter.heron.common.basics.WakeableLooper.loop(WakeableLooper.java:64)\n    at com.twitter.heron.instance.Slave.run(Slave.java:169)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.esotericsoftware.reflectasm.ConstructorAccess\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:331)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)\n    ... 18 more\n```\n\nwhich is reported by @ajorgensen in https://github.com/twitter/heron/issues/1165.
