Let me try to address some of them as well as the `punctuate` function in general.\n1. KTable: in fact it is not only designed for small tables, but can be used to host large tables with billions of records as long as it is partitioned on sufficient number of instances (note that each local state store just represent a \"shard\" of the global store which can be big), and just to give you some references Confluent's Kafka Enterprise Control Center also use Kafka Streams for aggregating and monitoring tracking events and stats, whose topology is complex with a bunch of sub-topologies and large traffic as well. So I feel that your use case would still be best fit with KTable-KTable join in Streams DSL.\n\nNote that there are some improvements we are working on such as non-key KTable-KTable join as well: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Discussion%3A+Non-key+KTable-KTable+Joins\n1. KStream aggregations: I think aggregate / reduce also have support for event-time based windowing, such as hopping windows and tumbling windows; it does not support sliding window (i.e. a new window to be created for EACH incoming record), which is only used in joins. If you can point me to which functions you were looking at for which AK version I can help more regarding the windowing function. That said, I still feel your use case would fit better in a non-windowed KTable-KTable join.\n2. Event timestamp: actually you can access the current processed record's event time through `ProcessorContext`, which is passed in `init()` call, you can just maintain it locally and access its `ProcessorContext.timestamp()` in `process()`.\n3. Finally, for `punctuate` function, I agree with you that there are common cases that system-time based triggering. We could add a config for controlling the mode or add another function in `Processor` just to distinguish these two types of `punctuates`. Let me have some more brain-storm with my team and get back to you soon.\n\nLet me know if you have more thoughts regarding my replies above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/237981621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/237991472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1527#issuecomment-237991472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1527","id":237991472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzk5MTQ3Mg==","user":{"login":"wushujames","id":677529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzUyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/677529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames","html_url":"https://github.com/wushujames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wushujames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-05T23:53:30Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T23:53:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Jenkins claimed that the PR failed in :streams:test, but the log didn't give any indication as to where. `./gradlew :streams:test` worked fine on my dev machine.

How does this differ at all from self-referential schemas where the contents of the schema need to be mutable but the reference to the schema object itself doesn't need to be? And `equals` and `hashcode` issues seem like they can be resolved by checking for identity equality to break these loops? Or is the issue that we need to track multiple schemas if schemas aren't directly self-referential but instead are indirectly self-referential?\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by the type vs instance of the type, but I think in your terms `parameters` are really about the instance of the type. The simplest example is the `Decimal` logical type -- it has a `scale` parameter that controls the decimal precision. It's tied to the instance of the type since we can have many different schemas of type `Decimal`, but they can differ in precision.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238064701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238065150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1487#issuecomment-238065150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1487","id":238065150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODA2NTE1MA==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-07T05:47:07Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T05:47:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@deragon Have kicked off https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/492 just to check that we don't break anything non-Cygwin.

The three fields all reference the same type, however one instance is optional, one instance has a default value and the other is just a plain int.\n\nAs a `ConnectSchema` this would be constructed:\n\n```\nSchemaBuilder.struct().name(\"connect\")\n  .field(\"int\", Schema.INT32_SCHEMA)\n  .field(\"int_optional\", Schema.OPTIONAL_INT32_SCHEMA)\n  .field(\"int_with_default\", SchemaBuilder.int32().defaultValue(0).build())\n.build();\n```\n\nThis represents a record with the same fields, except here the \"optionality\" and \"default\" are embedded in the schema so that each field actually references a different schema object. This means that we need the `FutureSchema` as a wrapper that can reference an existing schema (to reuse the type defining properties) but can override the `optional` and `default` properties. \n\nRe: equality and hashing: The tricky part is indeed indirectly cyclic schema's, and making the solution thread-safe. The only solution I can think of is to track the visited nodes and break the cycle when revisiting a node. To do this thread-safe a \"context\" needs to be passed along with the comparison, the resulting code is in the latest change set.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238173460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238198762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1709#issuecomment-238198762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1709","id":238198762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODE5ODc2Mg==","user":{"login":"b1tfury","id":2116435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2116435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury","html_url":"https://github.com/b1tfury","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b1tfury/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T10:28:23Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T10:28:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@here Guys, this is a simple change, please correct me if I am wrong.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238198762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238232150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1631#issuecomment-238232150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1631","id":238232150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODIzMjE1MA==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T13:18:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T13:18:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ewencp That makes sense.

So probably your version is the right way to handle most args like this, although I'm not sure its worth the effort to proactively clean up the rest of those cases.\n\nRemoving the `export` is

I think the section on Manual Offset Control can be read as suggesting that if you poll() and get records, then crash, auto commit might cause you to lose those messages. This is basically the case where we used to have buggy code that would allow the auto commit to happen at the end of poll() after the position had been updated.

I apologize for that. \n\nNow you made me feel doubts if chosen (so far) approach with HBase is the best for me. ))\n\nHowever, I still have better feeling for some cases with global-scalable-fast KV store. I realize that global KV store sounds like anti-pattern in streaming world - but it has some benefits with bringing it's own cost. I think that get/put throughput we have with HBase is solid enough comparing to amount of real-time data we consume (and expect to consume in near and long future). And HBase is scaling horizontally, so even unexpected real-time data growth will be handled by adding more nodes to a cluster. And yes, when all use-cases will be moved out from MySQL to new materialized viewes - SQL storage will be simply removed and data will be sent directly to kafka (topic that comes first after CDC data extraction from debezium topics). \n\nThese are my main concerns :\n\n1) Maintenance complexity. We have ~50 databases with the same DDL (shards) and target data occupies ~50 tables (majority of tables have dozens/hundreds of millions of records) in every database (due to data model normalization). So, only with current data model streaming we'll have like 50*50=2500 debezium CDC topics (one topic per table). And we want to simply clone this solution for other data models in future. I can't predict and measure how many topics (partitions) will be needed with Streams DSL approach, but this number is going to be significantly higher. And from operations standpoint the smaller amount of partitions you have - the happier you are (not a general rule, but when number goes beyond couple of thousands it may be true).\n\n2) Deployment/monitoring complexity. With Streams DSL approach we'll end up with 10-15 unique topologies (and some extra ones to prepare data for joins -- I am happy FK-joins are currently in progress by kafka community). With HBase approach there will be just two processor topologies : \n    a) topology that consumes data from debezium topic(s), shrinks it and sends to single topic (with many partitions) under composed key\n    b) topology, that consumes data from previous topic and aggregates it using HBase (with \"tick\" topic) and sends consolidated transaction data to target topic. \n\nYes, that's a tradeoff, since join/aggregation logic lies now on our shoulders - consolidate all relevant transaction pieces from HBase. But from other side we have enough flexibility to create generic solution, that will be relatively easily copied to other data models without coding (just processing meta-data specification). \n\nI am excited to hear your thoughts on that, and many thanks in advance!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238372710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238406705","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1709#issuecomment-238406705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1709","id":238406705,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODQwNjcwNQ==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T23:17:16Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T23:17:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Same

Create was set at the cluster level since the topic didn't exist yet but delete was likely set at the topic level since now there was a resource to control. \n\nAlternatively both could be allowed. This would allow it to be set at the cluster or topic level. Though I think you are right that common case would be at the cluster level. \n\nThe problem with hierarchical/inherited ACLs is that the expected behavior isn't specified well today and would be up to the individual Authorizer implementation to authorize correctly. The SimpleAclAuthorizer does this with the [ALL Operation](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/security/auth/SimpleAclAuthorizer.scala#L167)  and the [Read/Write to Describe Operation](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/security/auth/SimpleAclAuthorizer.scala#L130-L134). \n\nAnother option is to support wildcard resources similar to how we support wildcard principles. A topic resource with name \\* could grant access to delete any topic.\n\nIn the end those are more complicated approaches, when as you said the common case would be at the cluster level. \n\nThe behavior to control delete on the topic resource instead of the cluster was defined in [KIP-11](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-11+-+Authorization+Interface). Is it something we can change now? Would we need a discussion and a vote? \n\nWhatever is decided I am happy to make a change. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238746842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/238747155","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1616#issuecomment-238747155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/1616","id":238747155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODc0NzE1NQ==","user":{"login":"ewencp","id":47366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp","html_url":"https://github.com/ewencp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewencp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-10T02:11:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T02:11:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The current usage maps to how I would expect things to work with a REST API -- since the resource doesn't exist yet, Create is targeted at the collection (which for Topics is presumably Cluster). Since Delete is against a specific topic (a specific resource) it is targeted at that specific resource. Not sure about how this maps to auth. Some APIs support both `POST /cluster` and `PUT /cluster/topic` which I suppose lets you specify ACLs at both levels.\n\nIt's also a bit weird that creation is at the level of the Cluster instead of some Topics collection. We don't have many resources at the moment so maybe the potential collisions don't matter, but it doesn't seem great that you have to get any Create for a collection would have to enable Create for all types at the Cluster level.\n\nIf someone wants an app to only be authorized to create/delete topics associated with that app, it seems like the Topic resource version is necessary, right?
