This approach requires resetting the test cases by configuring the original Map into the newly created entity class for storing corresponding information and injecting this entity into the FactoryBean (ShiroFilterFactoryBean) and the BeanPostProcessor implementations. This issue took me a considerable amount of time to resolve. However, the downside is that when users configure ShiroFilterFactoryBean, the Bean created in the Configuration will no longer be ShiroFilterFactoryBean but the newly created entity class (which will be automatically injected into the FactoryBean and BeanPostProcessor implementations via @Autowired). In my tests, this setup appears to function correctly without generating warnings (though I haven't conducted exhaustive testing because I am busy with my graduation project). Unfortunately, if users try to create a Bean of AuthorizationAttributeSourceAdvisor in the Configuration class, warnings still appear. I haven't found the cause of this issue yet.

You can also ignore all major, minor, or patch releases for a dependency by adding an [`ignore` condition](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#ignore) with the desired `update_types` to your config file.\n\nIf you change your mind, just re-open this PR and I'll resolve any conflicts on it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2294139657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":{"id":29110,"client_id":"Iv1.4f9a6346434f815e","slug":"dependabot","node_id":"MDM6QXBwMjkxMTA=","owner":{"login":"github","id":9919,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github","html_url":"https://github.com/github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"name":"Dependabot","description":"","external_url":"https://dependabot-api.githubapp.com","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","created_at":"2019-04-16T22:34:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T21:06:35Z","permissions":{"actions":"read","checks":"write","contents":"write","issues":"write","members":"read","metadata":"read","pull_requests":"write","statuses":"read","vulnerability_alerts":"read","workflows":"write"},"events":["check_suite","issues","issue_comment","label","pull_request","pull_request_review","pull_request_review_comment","repository"]}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/comments/2294517649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/1581#issuecomment-2294517649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1581","id":2294517649,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAARy8s6Iw4-R","user":{"login":"Himakar","id":8923504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjM1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8923504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar","html_url":"https://github.com/Himakar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Himakar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-17T01:32:48Z","updated_at":"2024-08-17T01:32:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @lprimak , @fpapon ,\r\nThank you for your help.
