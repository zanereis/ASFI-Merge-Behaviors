It appears that this error is originating from gremlin-javascript. I think more investigation is needed here to find out how to prevent the node download from corrupting so frequently.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1768952207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1769004260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2249#issuecomment-1769004260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2249","id":1769004260,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5pcNzk","user":{"login":"ryn5","id":65996005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTk2MDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65996005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5","html_url":"https://github.com/ryn5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryn5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T17:22:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T17:22:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Seems to be failing on unrelated tests.
