The only thing I can think of is the addition of checkstyle.ini inside of tools/python that I added, and maybe that needs to be packaged in somehow.  I'm not familiar with how the build and test system works to do this.  Will need some help on this.  For reference, part of this PR was to modify the tools/java/.../PythonCheckstyle.java:84 where I added an additional command line parameter to read the checkstyle.ini file\n\n```\n  // Create and run the command\n  List<String> commandBuilder = new ArrayList<>();\n  commandBuilder.add(pylintFile);\n  commandBuilder.add(\"--rcfile=\" + PYLINT_RCFILE); // tools/python/checkstyle.ini\n  commandBuilder.addAll(sourceFiles);\n  runLinter(commandBuilder);\n```\n\nthis seems to work fine locally when I run the linter, but maybe it breaks the build somehow?\n\n## build output\n\nHeron is now installed!\nMake sure you have \"/home/travis/bin\" in your path. \nSee http://heronstreaming.io/docs/getting-started.html for how to use Heron.\nheron.build.version : 0.14.0-1083-g85bfa2b\nheron.build.time : Thu Jun  2 22:41:52 UTC 2016\nheron.build.timestamp : 1464907312000\nheron.build.host : testing-gce-e46a86b8-e324-4d1f-b559-f2aca088a128\nheron.build.user : travis\nheron.build.git.revision : 85bfa2bf893768f7e508ab45c2fd1188bd76f826\nheron.build.git.status : Modified\n+python integration-test/src/python/local_test_runner/main.py\nINFO:root:Submitting topology\nINFO:root:Submitting topology: \nINFO:root:[u'/home/travis/bin/heron', 'submit', '--verbose', '--', u'local', u'/home/travis/build/twitter/heron/bazel-genfiles/integration-test/src/java/local-integration-tests.jar', u'com.twitter.heron.local_integration_test.topology.local_readwrite.LocalReadWriteTopology', u'IntegrationTest_LocalReadWriteTopology', u'/home/travis/.herondata/topologies/local/travis/IntegrationTest_LocalReadWriteTopology/testing.txt', u'/home/travis/.herondata/topologies/local/travis/IntegrationTest_LocalReadWriteTopology/testing2.txt', '12']\n{'config_property': [], 'topology-file-name': '/home/travis/build/twitter/heron/bazel-genfiles/integration-test/src/java/local-integration-tests.jar', 'override_config_file': '/tmp/tmpnKCfnQ/override.yaml', 'config_path': '/home/travis/.heron/conf/local', 'subcommand': 'submit', 'deploy_deactivated': False, 'environ': 'default', 'cluster': 'local', 'topology_main_jvm_property': [], 'role': 'travis', 'verbose': 'True', 'topology-class-name': 'com.twitter.heron.local_integration_test.topology.local_readwrite.LocalReadWriteTopology'}\nERROR: Unable to execute topology main class\nINFO: Elapsed time: 0.001s.\nINFO:root:Submitted topology\nINFO:root:Successfully submitted KILL_TMASTER topology\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\nThe build has been terminated\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/223456417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/223458764","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/844#issuecomment-223458764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/844","id":223458764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzQ1ODc2NA==","user":{"login":"nlu90","id":16407807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDA3ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16407807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90","html_url":"https://github.com/nlu90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlu90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-03T00:11:27Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T00:11:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @samek, what do you mean by \"can't see anything happening beyond second bolt\"?\n\nDoes it mean your bolt logs/prints some information during the execution but you can't find it in Intellij's Console?

json, creates multiple streams), then I've got 2 bolts each consuming each own stream generated from splitter bolt. \n\nThing is that If I run it in InteliJ as debug or just run, I don't see any output from bolts which should consume streams from splitter (I've added output in the execute) nor I cannot put breakpoints in them. \n\nBut If I leave the simulator mode on, compile the topology (mvn package) then run heron submit local I can see all the outputs from all the bolts. \n\nSo It's basically both: I can't see output from bolts beyond the splitter bolt and I guess I need a guide on how to setup the InteliJ development for topologies :(
