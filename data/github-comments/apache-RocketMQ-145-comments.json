> > 2.创建topic时增加delete.deletion.ms属性，设置空消息的清除时间，不在合并中直接清除的直接原因，主要是担心消息发送和压缩过程太近，造成客户端还未消费到就被清除，实际应用中可能造成客户端无法更新本地数据\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > 个人感觉这个属性`delete.retention.ms`名字可能会导致混淆，被认为是正常消息过期删除的时间； 另外对于一个类kv系统，我觉得delete之后就应该get不到，我们应该缩短这个耗时，而不是增加这个耗时，compaction topic的正确使用应该是消费到消息之后，在本地先compaction一次，也就是说null消息在客户端本地就应该把之前相同key的消息删除(覆盖)，从而达到一个**实时**效果，如果需要消费到中间数据，顺序消息是不是能更好的满足需求。\r\n> > >

虽说是个kv系统，但不应该完全按照一个kv系统看待，实际的的kv系统是个共享存储，客户端直接请求远程获取的，所以正常的Kv系统是数据更新即可见；而compact topic 更多的场景是初始化加载全量，然后增量订阅变更（最大区别），客户端一般也不会直接去broker获取key相关的信息， 这个特性造成了，存储->订阅更新完成 有个过程， 直接删除null消息就会出现客户端订阅不到变更的问题，也就无法感知删除了； 其次，【在本地先compaction一次】，只适用于单client的情况下，应该对于分布式环境不适用【若在应用中再附以共享存储，那就没必要使用compaction topic了】 对于topic/partition比较多时，可能占用资源较高，这个还需要测试来分析，但我认为，compaction频率不需要太频繁，目前的默认值还是有点频繁的(可选择集群低峰期压缩)； 也可以将 开启删除 作为一个可配置的功能加入，若不开启，则保持原逻辑不变; 当然也可以高峰期依旧保持增量，低峰期定时全量一次（能保证一天一次全量即可），来解决性能的问题\r\n\r\n想了下，确实是存在null消息在消费到之前就被删除的情况，确实是需要增加一定的保留时间，并且看起来null消息不同的保留时长并不会带来什么影响，那是不是说可以在compact时判断下是否需要保留null消息即可呢","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1463143641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1463323770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/6288#issuecomment-1463323770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6288","id":1463323770,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85XOIx6","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-10T06:09:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T06:09:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"##

个人感觉这个属性`delete.retention.ms`名字可能会导致混淆，被认为是正常消息过期删除的时间； 另外对于一个类kv系统，我觉得delete之后就应该get不到，我们应该缩短这个耗时，而不是增加这个耗时，compaction topic的正确使用应该是消费到消息之后，在本地先compaction一次，也就是说null消息在客户端本地就应该把之前相同key的消息删除(覆盖)，从而达到一个**实时**效果，如果需要消费到中间数据，顺序消息是不是能更好的满足需求。\r\n> > > > 3.增量compaction时，没有新增文件也会继续进行compact，主要是为了清除body为 null的消息\r\n> > >

虽说是个kv系统，但不应该完全按照一个kv系统看待，实际的的kv系统是个共享存储，客户端直接请求远程获取的，所以正常的Kv系统是数据更新即可见；而compact topic 更多的场景是初始化加载全量，然后增量订阅变更（最大区别），客户端一般也不会直接去broker获取key相关的信息， 这个特性造成了，存储->订阅更新完成 有个过程， 直接删除null消息就会出现客户端订阅不到变更的问题，也就无法感知删除了； 其次，【在本地先compaction一次】，只适用于单client的情况下，应该对于分布式环境不适用【若在应用中再附以共享存储，那就没必要使用compaction topic了】 对于topic/partition比较多时，可能占用资源较高，这个还需要测试来分析，但我认为，compaction频率不需要太频繁，目前的默认值还是有点频繁的(可选择集群低峰期压缩)； 也可以将 开启删除 作为一个可配置的功能加入，若不开启，则保持原逻辑不变; 当然也可以高峰期依旧保持增量，低峰期定时全量一次（能保证一天一次全量即可），来解决性能的问题\r\n> \r\n> 想了下，确实是存在null消息在消费到之前就被删除的情况，确实是需要增加一定的保留时间，并且看起来null消息不同的保留时长并不会带来什么影响，那是不是说可以在compact时判断下是否需要保留null消息即可呢\r\n\r\n是的，但我也加了在topic不活跃的情况下，块文件新增可能比较慢，这样的情况下我加了空跑次数来合并清除历史的空数据，看看这部分需不需要，不加应该也可以接受","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1463393653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1464825819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/6100#issuecomment-1464825819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6100","id":1464825819,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85XT3fb","user":{"login":"RongtongJin","id":21963954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTYzOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21963954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin","html_url":"https://github.com/RongtongJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongtongJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-11T04:51:44Z","updated_at":"2023-03-11T05:02:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21963954/224465588-3c9e1bf7-b52e-43ce-96e4-92dcdb0fe1d6.png)\r\nThe
