The protocol output needs updating to be 64-bit friendly as was done with the transport library code. Those issues need to be resolved in tandem with codegen changes, though.\n\n```\nthrift/lib/cocoa/src/protocol/TCompactProtocol.m:127:14: warning: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'unsigned int' [-Wsign-conversion]\n    if ((n & ~0x7F) == 0) {\n           ~ ^~~~~\nthrift/lib/cocoa/src/protocol/TCompactProtocol.m:143:26: warning: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'const uint8_t' (aka 'const unsigned char') to 'int8_t' (aka 'signed char') [-Wsign-conversion]\n  [self writeByteDirect: COMPACT_PROTOCOL_ID];\n  ~                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthrift/lib/cocoa/src/protocol/TCompactProtocol.m:144:26: warning: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'uint8_t' (aka 'unsigned char') to 'int8_t' (aka 'signed char') [-Wsign-conversion]\n  [self writeByteDirect: (uint8_t)((COMPACT_VERSION & COMPACT_VERSION_MASK) |\n  ~                      ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nthrift/lib/cocoa/src/protocol/TCompactProtocol.m:183:75: warning: implicit conversion loses integer precision: 'int' to 'uint8_t' (aka 'unsigned char') [-Wconversion]\n  uint8_t typeToWrite = typeOverride == 0xFF ?

nice idea, but the introduction of new structs within test/ThriftTest.thrift breaks many other language tests, do you really need new structs? e.g. BonkMap is available as MapType\n\n`MapType` is a typedef for `map<string,Bonk>`, `BonkMap` is a struct containing member of type `map<string,Bonk>` - not the same thing.\n\nThe unit tests cover several basic cases:\n- struct member is a struct (`Xtruct2` fits)\n- struct member is a container that contains a struct\n  - list (`ListBonks` fits)\n  - set (no suitable existing type, `BonkSet` added)\n  - map (no suitable existing type, `BonkMap` added)\n- struct member is a container that contains container (no suitable existing type, `Bonkers` added - `CrazyNesting` doesn't fit because it has a map with a struct as a key which can't work in Javascript and no values that are structs)\n\nIt does appear that new structs are necessary. I understand that adding new service methods would break other tests, but adding struct definitions shouldn't break anything, it's really surprising (and wrong) \nif it does. If that is indeed the case I can move new struct definitions to a separate .thrift file to be used just in the deep constructor unit test.\n\n> There is also a inconsistent naming: ListBonks, BonkSet, BonkMap\n\nI can rename `BonkSet` -> `SetBonks`, `BonkMap` -> `MapBonks` to match `ListBonks` which was there before, although if I need to move structs for the deep constructor unit test to a separate file anyway I'd probably use different names altogether.

But this is another discussion. I will restore ThriftTest.thrift to the way it was and will create a new .thrift file for my test .\n\n> I also wonder if the compiler is the right place to add the __thriftCopyXXX functions, I think they should probably belong to the library code.\n\nThat's easy for nodejs, but in a browser environment user would have to explicitly add dependency on this new library via `script` tag (which is internal implementation detail and is not to be used for the client code directly), otherwise generated code would be broken \"out of the box\". So I think compiler is, unfortunately, the right place for these functions. \n\nIdeally there would be no compiler for js and no generated javascript at all, I think it should all be library code that works off of the spec (say spec'c json representation), but that's not the current approach and is a discussion for another day.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/98714766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/99094058","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/169#issuecomment-99094058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/169","id":99094058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5MDk0MDU4","user":{"login":"darionyaphet","id":4414314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTQzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4414314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet","html_url":"https://github.com/darionyaphet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darionyaphet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-05T14:25:09Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T14:25:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jfarrell
