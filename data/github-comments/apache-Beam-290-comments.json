When testing Beam 2.2, our IT is failing because Classes could not be found because the jars weren't present. Looking at the reason, our runner never received the String passed in through the `beamTestPipelineOptions` system property variable. The TestPipeline properly parses the variable and sets its member options correctly with `#testingPipelineOptions`. During the run phase, this serialization occurs making `jarsToStage` null, this then gets to our runner and doesn't add any jars cause none are specified.\r\n\r\nI can see where the non-Java SDK need arises and it is problematic since this is purely Java SDK-based.
