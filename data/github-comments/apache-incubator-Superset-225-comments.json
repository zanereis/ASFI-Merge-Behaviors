Some libraries are small, do one thing, and do it well, and no longer need to be updated at some point. But `Sugar` does more than one thing, and it has many dependencies, so even if we're using it for something that might never change (date parsing) it might break in the future if its dependencies change.\r\n\r\nChrono, on the other hand, does only one thing (date parsing), and only depends on `moment.js`, which we also depend on, so I think it's a safer bet.

I recently upgraded some other Flask apps to Flask 1.0 and was exposed to the newer way of configuring/running applications. \r\n\r\nI agree that including the dependency for `python-dotenv` makes sense. Note it's actually a Flask option, i.e., in `setup.py` having `flask[dotenv]` and re-running `pip-compile` (with the arguments specified in `requirements.txt`) should be suffice. \r\n\r\nNote my only concern about this is unless one disables the dotenv logic in production the CLI will be in-essence running `FLASK_ENV='development' flask db upgrade` (or similar). I don't see this is a major concern but it's somewhat against the previous approach of having environment specific configurations. Maybe there's merit in mentioning that one should either [disable](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/cli/#disable-dotenv) dotenv or explicitly set `FLASK_ENV='production'` (either in the `.env` file or on the command line) for production environments.\r\n\r\nAlso in your PR in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#flask-server) by including this package, I believe\r\n```\r\ncd superset\r\nFLASK_ENV=development flask run -p 8088 --with-threads --reload --debugger\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow simplifies to either, \r\n```\r\nflask run -p 8088 --with-threads\r\nsuperset run -p 8088 --with-threads\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote I still like having the `superset` CLI manager around (as defined in the `setup.py` file as in general it's more readable (contextually aware) to have `superset db upgrade` rather than `flask db upgrade`.

got me thinking more broadly about time filters. I think default behaviour for the presets (Last x days/weeks/etc) should apply the time grain to the where clause. For example, when applying a \"Last Year\" with quarterly grains, the first quarter will almost always have an incomplete set of rows, as the where clause will start somewhere between the start and and of the first quarter. It would be more logical to omit the first quarter entirely to make sure that all quarters are true full quarters. Applying the time grain to the time filter would rake care of this automatically.
