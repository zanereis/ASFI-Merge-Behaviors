@markusthoemmes.\r\n\r\nAm I reading correctly that the assumption is that the developer creating the action is also the one invoking the action ? How about actions that are exposed as REST endpoints via the API Gateway which have no OW AuthKey, but have only an OAuth 2 Token from a 3rd party identity provider ? How would we connect these OAuth tokens with some OW credentials used to deploy the action so that we can invoke it ? I think we have to solve this problem if we go down this path. WDYT ? \r\n\r\nThis is connected to another aspect that I struggle to understand in OW and that is the separation between the _management_ aspect ( the developers creating and managing actions ) vs the _execution_ aspect (the end-users of an application that invokes actions). In my mind these 2 categories : developers vs end-users have different concerns. They authenticate differently, end-users might not care about namespaces, logs, package names, actions names.\r\n\r\nThinking at the access to the activations and logs of an action, I imagine it's something that concerns more the team that is maintaining that action. If an application that uses an action gets an error back, even though it can access the activations and logs, but if it can't fix the action anyway, what's the utility other than debugging that action and maybe billing ?  \r\n\r\nI feel like we're missing another entity that would represent \"apps\". \"Apps\" are part of the _execution_ concern b/c they invoke the actions. Apps would subscribe to actions to be able to invoke them. Application info is part of the OAuth token ( the `client_id` that has generated the token ). When an OAuth token is not present we can ask the application to identity itself using an API-KEY for instance.  This way we could show to multiple personas information about activations, _who_ has invoked actions, and _what_ actions. In this way we don't have to solve the problem of matching an OAuth token with an OW Auth Key anymore. We're solving a different problem instead and we can also give access to multiple people to see the analytics for an application. Based on the usage data we can also do billing or charge-backs.   \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/270940616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/270942213","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1681#issuecomment-270942213","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1681","id":270942213,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk0MjIxMw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T16:29:22Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T16:35:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Am I reading correctly that the assumption is that the developer creating the action is also the one invoking the action ?\r\n\r\nAny authorized subject can invoke their actions (in their namespace which may be a shared space with other subjects) or actions in another namespace if the action is in a public package. This was and remains the intended behavior.\r\n\r\nWith the API gw acting as a proxy between end users and actions, the end user does not need whisk credentials. Whether we integrate bearer tokens or other ACL mechanism is orthogonal and should be deferred to a separate discussion (it's valid and there is ongoing work on this front and prototypes from @starpit). In this model, the end user doesn't see the activations and should be indifferent to how the REST call is serviced.
