I have a couple comments that I think we need to address before we merge this in and then I have additional feedback that I think needs to be included in the next Global Menu/Flow Status PR which will include the remainder of functionality in the mock up in NIFI-1323.\n\n**For this PR**\n- The birdseye view does not render the processor or processGroup preview. It appears the position is not being accessed correctly.\n- Can we move flowfont files into a separate directory under font (next to the Roboto directories)? Since flowfont.css came with flowfont can we please co-locate these? We'll also need to identify which images in this bundle were not produced by us and ensure we're updating license/notice accordingly.\n\n**For the next PR**\n- When dragging a component onto the canvas, the source icon leaves the toolbox when dragged. This icon should remain in the toolbox while a different icon should follow the cursor onto the canvas. Maybe we should update the original icon with something that suggests it's draggable while the dragged icon indicates that a new component is being added. Specifically, I'm thinking of our New Connection icon which shows a Connection arrow with a '+'.\n- The global menu button appears to shift upwards a couple pixels when clicked. I don't think this button should move. Additionally, the button and the menu are too disjoint especially while closing. They transition with different effects and at different rates.\n- The logged in user name wraps onto the following line where the Log Out link would be.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216065515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216117511","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/400#issuecomment-216117511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/400","id":216117511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjExNzUxMQ==","user":{"login":"PuspenduBanerjee","id":5090152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTAxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5090152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee","html_url":"https://github.com/PuspenduBanerjee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PuspenduBanerjee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-02T06:45:49Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T06:45:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt @apiri Please guide.

recommendation would be a command line utility (could be a shell script wrapping a JAR) which is  invoked without arguments, provides a secure prompt for entering a raw password, and returns the hashed password in _bcrypt_ format. \n\nI think the Java code necessary to read from the XML configuration file, accept a username and password entered in the UI form field, verify the credentials are correct, and return a JWT authentication token should remain. \n\nThe administrative functionality of the utility (reading and writing the XML file) does not seem necessary to me. \n\nAgain, I understand the desire for this from a proof-of-concept and quick-deploy mindset, but I'll reiterate my feeling that this lightweight option will become an accidental de facto default because it requires less effort to deploy than LDAP, Kerberos, or client certificate authentication. Currently, I believe those alternatives are all more robust and secure than this approach:\n- Each is a widely supported approach with many eyes on them, making discovery of vulnerabilities more likely\n- Each protects the knowledge of the end users' passwords from the administrator, unlike this approach\n- Each scales without the manual intervention of the administrator (authorization still requires manual intervention)\n\nI appreciate the effort to move away from anonymous access as the default for the application. However, I believe there should be a balance here, as the default is very clear that no authentication is performed. Administrators must make an intentional effort to secure the instance with LDAP, Kerberos, or client certificates, all of which I acknowledge have a higher cost of entry than simple username/password authentication from a file store. My fear is that as this method is the lowest cost, it will be explained (incompletely) on a random blog article, become the quickest route for admins to get it running without fully reading the documentation or knowing its limitations, and then be deployed to a production environment. \n\nI understand these concerns are mostly intuitive and not examples I can point to with empirical evidence. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216594397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216595481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/384#issuecomment-216595481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/384","id":216595481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjU5NTQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T16:59:33Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T16:59:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Latest changes look good, I am a +1 again :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216595481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216610646","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/392#issuecomment-216610646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/392","id":216610646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjYxMDY0Ng==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-03T17:51:54Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T17:51:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also, can you update the PR message with some description?

Thanks for the review! All your comments should be addressed except the state management pieces.\n\nState management should work more or less like `ListHDFS`. I personally found the state management bits of `ListHDFS` difficult to follow, so I tried a similar but different approach.\n\nOn each restore, we grab two keys: `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and `CURRENT_KEY_PREFIX+\"0\"`. If both of these exist, the state is considered valid, and further restoration is attempted. Mostly that means we parse `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` into a long and use `extractKeys()` to gather as many keys that start with `CURRENT_KEY_PREFIX` as are present in the state map. These values are later used to decided whether a listed key is newer than last time we ran. \n\nAt the end of each run, we persist the newest key timestamp and at least one filename with the maximum discovered timestamp.\n\nThe processor does restore state on each trigger. I think there are a couple things to note:\n- Listing an S3 bucket generally takes a little while (e.g. 100ms), so that puts a pretty high lower bound on the number of times state might be restored per second. In other words, it seems unlikely we'd try to restore state with a high frequency.\n- ListS3 also persists state after each trigger. I didn't think about this until after submitting this PR, but really we should be committing flowfiles and persisting state after every batch (1000 objects by default) to avoid unbounded memory growth on large buckets. So in some cases the initial restore is only one of potentially many roundtrips to the state manager per trigger. \n- I have no concept of how expensive restoring and persisting state actually are.\n\nI'd be happy to implement state management caching if you think its necessary. Its probably not complicated, but my general philosophy is that more conditionals = more bugs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216751696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216842191","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/366#issuecomment-216842191","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/366","id":216842191,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjg0MjE5MQ==","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T12:14:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T12:14:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just played a little bit with the processors and here are some remarks:\n\nCosmetic remarks\n- add the duration in provenance events\n- add the number of messages sent/received (useful when batching)\n\nTesting\n1. Simple case\nWhen I have a topic with one broker and one partition. It seems to be OK: no more data loss, demarcator seems to be used correctly. LGTM.\n2. I then deleted my topic and recreated it with 5 partitions. I am sending flow files with 2 JSON strings (one by line). The PublishKafka is set with appropriate demarcator, plaintext, guarantee replicated delivery, round robin partitioner and snappy compression. All messages are correctly sent to Kafka. The ConsumeKafka has no particular settings (no demarcator). The thing is I do not retrieve all the published messages. For each FlowFile, each JSON contains the date, I can confirm that the very first flow file is correctly published and consumed (two messages), then I have 3 FlowFiles (not consecutive) for which 2 messages are published but only one is consumed.\n\nI don't know it that helps a lot. I'll try to look closer later in the day.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216842191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216852394","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/366#issuecomment-216852394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/366","id":216852394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjg1MjM5NA==","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T12:48:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T12:48:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pvillard31 Thanks for playing with it. Quick question. I don't quite understand the second point.So let me try to paraphrase it until I stumble:\n1. You say PublishKafka publishes correctly. I am assuming you were able to verify that all messages that you have published were published. Correct?\n2. The fist FlowFile you published with two messages is consumed by ConsumeKafka correctly. Correct?. The second FlowFile published . . . that is where I am lost in translation ;)\n\nJust trying to understand a scenario so i can may be add a test for it.\n\nCheers\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216852394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/216860573","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/238#issuecomment-216860573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/238","id":216860573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNjg2MDU3Mw==","user":{"login":"apiri","id":502889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri","html_url":"https://github.com/apiri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apiri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T13:17:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T13:17:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@adamonduty Thanks for the explanation and your thoughts, very helpful and very much appreciated.

The 3 missing messages are originating from 3 different FlowFiles.

Basically if you execute it on current master it will fail the assertions and then with your changes it will succeed.\nAlso keep in mind that you would need a second PR (one as an update to this one and another for 0.x branch that is essentially 0.7.0-SNAPSHOT). The reason being is that _UserService_ was migrated to _KeyService_ so the test below won't compile on 0.x where you still have to use UserService. I am sure you'll figure it out.

@JPercivall \nFew remarks:\n- when there is a timeout, what I observed is a request with a dispatcher type set to ERROR (I've never seen ASYNC so far).\n- I was not aware of the cleaning job in the context map, but since the jetty timeout is 30 seconds, that would explain why the context map is never cleared once jetty starts to continuously send error dispatch messages.\n\nI am definitely a +1 to remove the property and automatically set the timeout in line with the context map.

I apologize I had to take care of work related assignments and could not get back to addressing your review comments, earlier.  However, I would like to discuss this pull request with and get your advice/recommendations on it.\n\nHere is a summary some of the changes I made for integrating the Kinesis Consumer/Producer into the aws nifi processors. You probably are already familiar with these but just so that we are on the same page and you can correct/advice me. Currently aws nifi processors extend the class:\n\n`\npublic abstract class AbstractAWSCredentialsProviderProcessor<ClientType extends AmazonWebServiceClient> extends AbstractAWSProcessor<ClientType>\n`\n\nAll the current aws nifi processors use AmazonWebServiceClient to connect the aws services.  There is a similar client for Kinesis: `AmazonKinesisClient`.  However, AWS also a new pair of libraries `KinesisProducer` from the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) and `KinesisRecordProcessor` based `Worker` from Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL) classes.  These new libraries handle batching, packing  records, parallelism, resharding, workload balancing, monitoring, asynchronous processing, retries, etc.  For using KCL/KPL we do not need `AmazonWebServiceClient` based client classes.  I chose to implement the Nifi AWS Kinesis Get and Put processors using KCL/KPL libraries rather than the older AmazonKinesisClient.\n\nI could have implemented Nifi Kinesis processors  separately, but I thought it would be better if we have a common base class hierarchy for all Nifi AWS processors.  In order to make things consist for all the Nifi AWS processors (those that use `AmazonWebServiceClient` and those that don't eg: `KinesisProducer`), I created a base class 'AbstractBaseAWSProcessor' which is a non-generic, simple class.  This class has two subclasses:\n- `AbstractAWSProcessor` which is the superclass of all Nifi AWS Processors using generic `AmazonWebServiceClient` (eg: S3, etc)\n-  `AbstractKinesisProcessor` which does not use `AmazonWebServiceClient` and instead use the KPL/KCL classes.\n\nI used `AbstractSessionFactoryProcessor` as the base class for `AbstractBaseAWSProcessor` rather than `AbstractProcessor`.  The reason for this was that KCL `Worker` instance invokes `IRecordProcessorFactory` asynchronously to create a `IRecordProcessor`, which it uses to handles records as they arrive by invoking the following method: \n\n`void processRecords(ProcessRecordsInput processRecordsInput)` \n\nIn order to create the `ProcessSession` on demand (for GetKinesis) I found we need to have access to the `SessionFactory`.  The `AbstractBaseAWSProcessor` therefore extends `AbstractSessionFactoryProcessor` and it has two methods to handle both cases where we need to access session for current Nifi AWS processors and PutKinesis processor, and GetKinesis which can create the session on demand on arrival of records.  Here is the relevant code:\n\n{code}\npublic void onTrigger(final ProcessContext context, final ProcessSessionFactory sessionFactory) throws ProcessException {\n        final ProcessSession session = sessionFactory.createSession();\n        try {\n            onTrigger(context, session);\n            session.commit();\n        } catch (final Throwable t) {\n            getLogger().error(\"{} failed to process due to {}; rolling back session\", new Object[]{this, t});\n            session.rollback(true);\n            throw t;\n        }\n    }\n public abstract void onTrigger(final ProcessContext context, final ProcessSession session) throws ProcessException;\n{code}\n\nFinally, the `Worker` used in the `GetKinesis` is a runnable and I used ExecutorService to launch and manage it's lifecycle.\n\nIf you have any thoughts/recommendations/etc on how I can implement the Kinesis processors using KCL/KPL please let me know.\n\nTo address the review comments from @olegz :\n1. Regarding the empty onScheduled method and constructor - I can remove them.\n2. Regarding using sub-classing from `AbstractProcessor`, I used the `AbstractSessionFactoryProcessor` to get access to SessionFactory on demand.\n3. Regarding consumerWorker.shutdown() throwing exception - The shutdown method on the worker only sets a shutdown flag and does not throw any exception.  But if you have any advice, let me know.\n\nThanks again for your advice/support and I hope to get your feedback incorporated as soon as I can.\n\nMans\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218325113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218325829","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/429#issuecomment-218325829","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/429","id":218325829,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODMyNTgyOQ==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-10T23:54:21Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T23:54:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"May the --force be with you ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218325829/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218329839","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/255#issuecomment-218329839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/255","id":218329839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODMyOTgzOQ==","user":{"login":"joaohf","id":278690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf","html_url":"https://github.com/joaohf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaohf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T00:21:17Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T00:21:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @apiri,\n\nFixed the test that was failed.\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218329839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/218336255","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/431#issuecomment-218336255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/431","id":218336255,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODMzNjI1NQ==","user":{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-11T01:08:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T01:08:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 looks like a great start so far!
