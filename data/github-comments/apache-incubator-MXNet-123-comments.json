For example, the built-in `checkpoint` callback works fine in the same way. I think @bearsroom is talking about more complicated modules like `SequentialModule` and `BucketingModule`. In some cases, there are multiple symbols (like bucketing). I was thinking about saving all the instantiated instances as a key-value dictionary. But that might not be enough during testing. In some other cases, such a `PythonModule`, there might not even be any symbol associated with it.\n\nCurrently a better solution might be to isolate the network definition functions of your experiment in a separate file, and load that file to define networks in both training and testing, and then it will work even if no symbols are loaded.
