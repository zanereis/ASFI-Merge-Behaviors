The user application could have used CQDs, Control query shape and other settings to influence the behavior of the user query, It can make the catalog APIs to behave differently. Also, in the past we have used control query shape to influence and produce optimal  query plan for the metadata queries. In the days before Trafodion, we had used module file concept to isolate the metadata queries from being influenced by the user settings. In Trafodion, we need to have such isolation, otherwise we can get non-deterministic results/errors from these queries. The best place to do this isolation is the server side. \n\nIt is good that DBVisualizer works with this change. But, we need to look at the change in a holistic way to make Trafodion
