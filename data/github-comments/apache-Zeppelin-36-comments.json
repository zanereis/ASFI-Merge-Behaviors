Moon,\n\nFrom the exception looks like it is trying to test Spark in a standalone\nmode and it is not able to register the master process.\n\nIdeally the standalone cluster (with its master and slave) should be\ncreated before hand. I tested that way and it always worked that way.\n\nI'm assuming this is output from a testing done by CI/automated testing.\nMost probably there may be a script missing which is supposed to start the\nSpark standalone cluster before hand.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nRegards,\nSourav\n\nOn Wed, Jan 20, 2016 at 5:33 PM, Lee moon soo notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I've made some progress on
