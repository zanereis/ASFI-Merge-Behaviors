we discovered that on a number of occasions the `slice_id` column in the `logs` table was `0` whilst viewing slices. We speculate it's non-zero when someone saves a slice or adds it to a new or existing dashboard. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure when this regression occurred, i.e., why the `slice_id` isn't defined in either the `request.form`, `request.args`, or `kwargs` per [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/models/core.py#L752) logic, but looking at the logs it seems to be logged in the `form_data` key of `request.args`, i.e., \r\n```\r\n{\"form_data\": \"{\\\"datasource\\\":\\\"219__druid\\\",\\\"viz_type\\\":\\\"line\\\",\\\"slice_id\\\":9797}\"}\r\n```\r\nWe hypothesized that the fix would be, \r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    slice_id = int(d.get('slice_id') or json.loads(d.get('form_data')).get('slice_id')))\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n    slice_id =
