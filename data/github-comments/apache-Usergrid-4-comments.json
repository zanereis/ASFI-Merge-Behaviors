People already have Integers in statistics. By not accounting for Integers we force everybody who had notification statistics to not have access without them doing a re-put of all afflicted data.\n2. The endpoint you mentioned is also an issue, but not the one I tested against. My main concern was with a UUID PUT with the payload. If you check my test you can see it in more detail. It would skip the NotificationService#postCollection and instead go through org.apache.usergrid.services.AbstractCollectionService#putItemById. \n\nThe way I see it is that it is a bit ugly, but it stems from the fact that we have a field that is required to be Long but we don't explicitly enforce that on POST's or PUTs. The way we deal with this for regular entities is to useobject maps because then we can use any type based on what the user wants. Thats why I used objects above, but I can also agree that is really just a hack until we do the aforementioned checking for all of our expected types. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/217963801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/217964339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/usergrid/pull/514#issuecomment-217964339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/514","id":217964339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzk2NDMzOQ==","user":{"login":"GERey","id":4109659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDk2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4109659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey","html_url":"https://github.com/GERey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-09T19:28:37Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T19:28:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed, I'll hold up until some of the more major changes are in master then I'll resubmit this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/217964339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/comments/218288120","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/usergrid/pull/519#issuecomment-218288120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/usergrid/issues/519","id":218288120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODI4ODEyMA==","user":{"login":"GERey","id":4109659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDk2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4109659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey","html_url":"https://github.com/GERey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GERey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-10T20:53:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T20:53:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This PR removes events, it is the opposite to #520 since that completely fixes events.

However, I can't see how it's beneficial to add 5.4.x Elasticsearch dependencies to the testing framework when Usergrid itself is not updated to support anything newer than 1.x of Elasticsearch. \r\n\r\nIn terms of effort to add support for later versions of Elasticsearch, I imagine this to be a big effort. There will be breaking changes, maybe many, between 1.x and 5.x versions of Elasticsearch. The approach has to be thought through very carefully, otherwise existing users of Usergrid will be left in an awkward situation when trying to upgrade.
