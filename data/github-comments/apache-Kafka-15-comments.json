However, I've never been a fan of centralized factory methods because it makes other implementations _second-class citizens_, since _they_ can't be created using the factory. (Yes, we could use Java's `ServiceLoader` mechanism, but that's IMO that's overkill and still doesn't allow customization of create methods in other KeyValueStore implementations.)\n\nNow, I do agree that the 2 existing implementations (or 3 including #256) all have similar factory methods with identical signatures, and that might suggest value to a common way to build them. But perhaps a builder (rather than a factory class) might be more usable by processors and reusable by other `KeyValueStore` implementations. For example:\n\n```\nInMemoryStore<String,Integer> store = InMemoryStore.create(name,context)\n                                                   .withKeySerializer(new StringSerializer())\n                                                   .withKeyDeserializer(new StringDeserializer())\n                                                   .withValueSerializer(new IntegerSerializer())\n                                                   .withValueDeserializer(new IntegerDeserializer())\n                                                   .withSystemTime()\n                                                   .build();\n```\n\nIt would be possible to create a base interface and impl for this builder in `KeyValueStore` that subclasses could reuse _and extend_ with their own methods. The builder could have overloaded methods, too, without resulting in combinatorial explosion of separate factory methods. For example, the builder could have both `withSystemTime()` and `withTime(Time)`, and the last one used wins. And it could have multiple `withKeySerializer` methods that take different things, such as a serializer instance, the serializer class (to automatically create the instance using a no-arg constructor), or the key class (for built-in serdes only). IDEs also make builders pretty convenient to use.\n\nThis will expand the Kafka Streams code a bit, but IMO it is worth it because it will make it even easier (albeit a bit more verbose) to create `KeyValueStore` instances in processors.\n\nI'll prototype something up, but should I do that as part of this PR/issue, or under a separate \"Simplified approach to create KeyValueStores\" issue?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144516933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144525572","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/255#issuecomment-144525572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/255","id":144525572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDUyNTU3Mg==","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-30T20:07:47Z","updated_at":"2015-09-30T20:10:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang, it may be difficult or unattractive to use a builder with the generic key and value types, unless somehow they're specified in the `create` method or by explicitly typing:\n\n```\nInMemoryKeyValueStore<String, Integer> store = InMemoryKeyValueStore.<String, Integer>create(\"something\", context)\n                                               .withKeySerializer(new StringSerializer())\n                                               .withKeyDeserializer(new StringDeserializer())\n                                               .withValueSerializer(new IntegerSerializer())\n                                               .withValueDeserializer(new IntegerDeserializer())\n                                               .withSystemTime()\n                                               .build();\n```\n\nThe good news is that the above code forces the IDE to type-check the `with...` methods, but it's not pretty.

Is this accurate?\n\nIf this is true, and since builders are relatively difficult to implement for parameterized stores, then I agree that a factory class might be the best way forward. Do you have time to list what you might have been thinking of for an API? Perhaps given some store defined in a `Processor`:\n\n```\nprivate KeyValueStore<String, Integer> myStore;\n```\n\nthe store could be created in `init(...)` with something like:\n\n```\nmyStore = Stores.inMemory()\n                .create(name,context,...);\n```\n\nor with limited memory (see #256):\n\n```\nmyStore = Stores.inMemory()\n                .maxCount(4096)\n                .create(name,context,...);\n```\n\nor to use the database:\n\n```\nmyStore = Stores.offHeap()\n                .create(name,context,...);\n```\n\nWhat do you think? This is somewhat like a builder, but all of the parameters that drive the key and value types have to be passed in at once (e.g., only the `create(...)` methods would use generics).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144801320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144803896","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/264#issuecomment-144803896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/264","id":144803896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDgwMzg5Ng==","user":{"login":"MayureshGharat","id":4326831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat","html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T18:09:40Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T18:09:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144803896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144803945","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/267#issuecomment-144803945","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/267","id":144803945,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDgwMzk0NQ==","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T18:09:56Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T18:09:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So technically, KafkaConsumer lets a user switch from topic subscriptions to partition subscriptions.

But making these changes now means that when Kafka moves to Java 8 we _can_ change our interfaces to extend the Java 8 ones _and_ change the interfaces to accept the Java 8 equivalents (what will be the supertype of our interfaces). And that should be a compatible change: any existing code that uses our interfaces will still work (after all, our interfaces will still be sub-interfaces of the type the methods will accept), and any new code could use either the Java 8 equivalents (preferred) _or_ our interfaces. If we want, we could even deprecate our interfaces and encourage users to use the Java 8 equivalents, and in the subsequent major release remove those interfaces.\n\n> This won't be a compatible change, however (we would have to use overloads to make it compatible, but that would cause issues for lambdas, so it's a no go).\n\nActually, the most important part of my proposed change is to rename the _methods_ to match those in the Java 8 equivalents so that we don't need overloads or additional methods (nor even default methods). Renaming the class/interface names is not strictly required, but IMO aligns our concepts with those in Java 8 and makes them a bit easier to grasp for new users.\n\nIf someone sees a flaw in my logic, please say so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144869301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/144873633","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/270#issuecomment-144873633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/270","id":144873633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDg3MzYzMw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T23:10:51Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T23:10:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Reading your message, I think you are referring to source compatibility, not binary compatibility right?
