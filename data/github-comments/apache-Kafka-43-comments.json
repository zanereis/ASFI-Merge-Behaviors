Do you want me to add \"MINOR\" to the commit message as well?  \n\nOne followup question, the change added to the .sh file was to keep the CLASSPATH setup similar to what was happening in windows...avoiding picking up any CLASSPATH coming in from the outside.  One problem we had out of the box was that some unexpected third party jars were being added in front of Kafka and interfering with log4j initialization.  I was thinking it would be a good idea to keep the CLASSPATH setup consistent between the .sh and .bat versions one way or the other.

It seems that you added the logic in KafkaApis to block a createTopicRequest until the metadata of the topic is propagated to the broker to which the createTopicRequest is sent. However, from a client's perspective, if it really wants to make sure that the topic is available, it has to wait for the metadata to be propagated to every broker since the metadata request can be issued to any broker.\n\nThere are a couple ways to do that: (1) forward the createTopicRequest to the controller and let the controller block until it propagates the metadata to every broker; (2) if this is just for admin purpose, we can implement the logic in the admin client to check the metadata on every broker after topic creation. (1) is a bit involved since we probably have to clean up the controller a bit to facilitate that. If we want to do (2) for now, there is no need to block in the createTopicRequest. Alternatively, we can just make createTopicRequest async for now (i.e., the topic's metadata is not guaranteed to be propagated to every broker after the request is responded.).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/184879421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/184890187","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/626#issuecomment-184890187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/626","id":184890187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDg5MDE4Nw==","user":{"login":"granthenke","id":1928566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1928566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke","html_url":"https://github.com/granthenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granthenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-16T21:53:18Z","updated_at":"2016-02-16T21:53:18Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@junrao Thanks for taking a look. \n\nGood point, we really need to be sure its propagated everywhere. I need to look at what it would take to implement, but I would really like to do it right this time. Especially given that a bunch of other admin requests may need to follow a similar pattern. For example I have some WIP code for for [KAFKA-2946](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2946): DeleteTopic - protocol and server side implementation that leverages the same code: \nhttps://github.com/granthenke/kafka/compare/create-wire...granthenke:delete-wire\n\nYou mentioned forwarding the requests to the controller. Another option is to force admin requests like this to go to the active controller and block until it propagates the metadata.

For admin requests like create/delete, forwarding is less of an issue since there are a lot fewer of those requests. Being able to talk to any broker also has the benefit that it simplifies the client side logic. Our client code uses non-blocking socket. Requiring finding the controller broker first means that we have to track an additional state in the client, which makes the client implementation more complicated. So, overall, forwarding admin requests to the controller is probably better.\n\nWe have to think through the following things: (1) we probably need a separate purgatory while waiting on the response if forwarding is needed. (2) Currently, the controller code is a bit messy and we plan to clean it up in the future (e.g., KAFKA-3210). So, ideally, whatever changes we make in the controller shouldn't be too intrusive or making the logic much more complicated than it is now. (3) If we make create/delete block, we probably should also make alter block as well. This is even tricker. First,  currently, most topic configs are stored in ZK and propagated through ZK watchers to the broker directly w/o going through the controller. So, not sure how we make sure that the topic config change is propagated to all brokers unless we talk to every broker directly. Alternatively, we can change config propagation so that it also goes through the controller. However, this requires inter broker protocol changes. Second, if one changes the replica assignment, we have to copy data across brokers. This can take arbitrarily long. So, it probably doesn't make sense to have a blocking request in this case. The client will have to keep checking periodically to see if this is done.\n\nGiven all the above, that's why initially we thought it's easier to start with just the async version of the those requests. If we want to go directly to the blocking implementation. It will be useful to think through the plan for each type of admin request.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/184930940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/184952148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/915#issuecomment-184952148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/915","id":184952148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDk1MjE0OA==","user":{"login":"sasakitoa","id":9620266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjAyNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9620266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa","html_url":"https://github.com/sasakitoa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sasakitoa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T00:56:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T00:56:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @granthenke.\nSorry, I missed it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/184952148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/184970353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/909#issuecomment-184970353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/909","id":184970353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDk3MDM1Mw==","user":{"login":"jcustenborder","id":209792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTc5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/209792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder","html_url":"https://github.com/jcustenborder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcustenborder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T01:53:10Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T01:53:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That works for me.

For large clusters that may not scale and the implementation could be complex. For that reason, having the controller be the definitive authority on the state of the cluster would be useful. \n\nSince the MetadataRequest is a sort of \"DescribeTopic\" topic request.

This opens up a security hole in current authorization support of Kafka. Default authorizer, SimpleAclAuthorizer, relies on ZK authentication to address this. However, there is no information provided to custom authorizers (via current APIs) to be able to determine if a particular request from a user should be allowed or not.\n\nTo fix this we need to add user authentication, possible options are.\n1. Add request/response for CRUD of acls. The requests will be performed on broker.\n2. kafka-acls.sh gets the user information and passed it to authorizer, which then can perform authentication, which then can check if user has sufficient privileges for a requested action.\n\nLet's talk about each of these approaches in detail. \n1. _Add request/response for CRUD of acls_. Sure this sounds to be inline with general direction of moving all admin commands over wire. I am in favor of this. However, before we get comfortable with this idea, below are the concerns/ questions that we should think about.\n   1. User info still needs to be obtained and passed to broker. Yes, using a common admin client that takes care of this will help.\n   2. For user authentication on broker, we have couple of options.\n      1. _Let broker to the authentication_. Currently there is no resource or model for which a user can be authorized to check if a user has privileges to perform CRUD on privileges. Even if we translate a user trying to modify an ACL on existing resource into some required acl on the resource, we need to authenticate the user for that resource via authorizer. Catch 22 situation? Honestly, I do not see a reason for expecting that authorizer should trust kafka for deciding if it should let a user to perform CRUD on privileges, etc. One might say, we should restrict these operations to kafka's admin user only, which will take care of the issue of authorizing users via authorizer before allowing/denying their request of CRUD ops. For that just imagine you have to go to your admin every time you have to perform chmod/chown on topics you have created, even to see perms as part of your ls command.\n      2. _Pass the user information to authorizer_. Ok, so we are again talking about modifying APIs here, the problem this JIRA points at?\n   3. The problem exists in 0.9, are we saying wait till 0.10 before we address this issue? Please correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that KIP-4 will probably make it to 0.10.\n2. _kafka-acls.sh gets and passes user info directly to authorizer_. This does not require waiting on KIP-4, however this is probably not a long term solution. May serve as a solution till we have KIP-4 is done and incorporated completely. Passing user information can be done in a couple of ways.\n   1. Modify APIs in a backwards compatible way, i.e, by default pass null as requesting user info.\n   2. Pass this info as part of authorizer properties. As this is supposed to be a stop gap solution, this is not a terrible idea.\n\nWhatever path we decide to take, we should come up with some solution for custom authorizers for 0.9. This issue makes custom authorizers _not so useful_. Please correct me if any of my aforementioned understanding is flawed.\n\n@gwenshap you are correct if the user is not authenticated, there is no point in passing his/her info.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/185342968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/185363481","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/764#issuecomment-185363481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/764","id":185363481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTM2MzQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"becketqin","id":5778611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg2MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5778611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin","html_url":"https://github.com/becketqin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/becketqin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-17T19:25:24Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T19:25:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ijuma Thanks for the review.
