deploy sql task through python-gate.\r\nSql type will be identified by the regex.\r\nI think it should be specified by a parameter.\r\n\r\nWhen I upload a sql type task through python gate\r\nThe type of sql (SELECT / NOT_SELECT) can only be determined by regular\r\nIt should be more intuitive to specify through a parameter\n\n### Use case\n\nI can't create table task through python-gate.\r\nBecause the \"create table xxx\" sql will be identified as \"SELECT\" type.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to make a sql task that creates a table, it will be recognized as \"SELECT\" type, which will cause the task to fail because the regular expression is\r\n \"^(?!(.* |)insert |(.* |)delete |(.* |)drop |(.* |)update |(.* |)alter ).*\"\n\n### Related issues\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you

and the binary package structure already changed, I think you could change it too. But you could also just delete `<create|upgarde>-dolphinscheduler.sh` in this PR too\r\n\r\n@SbloodyS @zhongjiajie  I've fixed `upgrade-schema.sh` and updated db upgrade related docs in the latest commits. I just checked the `configuration.md`, it seems that we need to update the whole `Directory Structure` section.
