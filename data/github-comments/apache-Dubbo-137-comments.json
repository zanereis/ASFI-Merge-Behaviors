(Maven groupId为com.alibaba)升级到2.7.3（Maven groupId为org.apache.dubbo）以后，在provider.xml配置文件中对应的accesslog的配置项不起作用了。\r\n（2）在升级的过程中做了metadata-report的配置，一开始怀疑是由于这部分的配置导致dubbo从config centre获取配置，但是后来发现去掉这部分的配置仍然无法记录accesslog。\r\n（3）换过两个provider端的程序（考虑到可能由于application-name重复导致的配置在ZK中存在了？），从未配置过metadata-report的程序在升级到2.7.3以后也是无法记录accesslog的。\r\n\r\n（4）远程DEBUG了一波，发现2.7.3里面的AccessLogFilter会从invoker的URL中取参数项“dubbo.accesslog”（通过变量AccessLogFilter.ACCESS_LOG_KEY），但是URL中根本不存在这个项，对应在URL中存在的是“accesslog”配置项。\r\n调试2.6.5版本的代码发现是通过“accesslog”（通过变量Constants.ACCESS_LOG_KEY）的配置项获取对应的值。\r\n\r\n（5）因此分析，可能是由于升级后的版本代码变更后，对日志这部分进行了调整。通过查阅其它issue发现有说根据官网文档配置的方式。后来参考[官方文档](http://dubbo.apache.org/en-us/docs/user/demos/accesslog.html)的Logging by logging framework小节配置了一波，发现能够创建配置的日志文件，但是不打印访问日志.....另外根据Logging by specified file path小节配置的就是原来的配置方法，不生效（不创建日志文件，也不打印日志）。\r\n\r\n\r\n顺带建议一下：能否更新一下官网的文档？那文档太迷了....也不知道对应哪个版本。\r\ngithub里面的wiki也存在文档不清晰的问题，有些配置区分admin.xxx 和dubbo.xxx，到底是啥效果也没说清楚....\r\n希望Dubbo能越来越好，尽管Service Mesh被吹的挺厉害，但个人还是比较认可Dubbo，希望它能越来越完善。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/549732894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/549777535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5283#issuecomment-549777535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5283","id":549777535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTc3NzUzNQ==","user":{"login":"makingtime","id":53243647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjQzNjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53243647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime","html_url":"https://github.com/makingtime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/makingtime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-05T11:10:12Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T11:10:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"网卡信息：\r\n\r\n```\r\nipconfig

And I found some sick codes like below after this PR:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n                sampleValue = sample.get(key);\r\n                if (sampleValue == null) {\r\n                    sampleValue = sample.get(key);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it okay?\r\n\r\nAnd it's ok for me whether to remove it or preserve it. I just want a confirmation maybe and I will clean the useless codes remained if so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/552351212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/comments/552359790","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/5303#issuecomment-552359790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5303","id":552359790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MjM1OTc5MA==","user":{"login":"jasonjoo2010","id":17573073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTczMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17573073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-11T09:21:38Z","updated_at":"2019-11-11T09:21:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"And ...... who can tell me what happened to the travis?
