saw a new project today, this code is relatively simple, which also implements the basic plugin, the code is quite clear. You can refer to it: (This is much less than the StreamSets code, it is much simpler)\r\n\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/harbby/sylph Stream computing platform for bigdata\r\n\r\nThe plugin uses the com.github.harbby.gadtry.classloader.DirClassLoader of https://github.com/harbby/gadtry to load plugins\r\n\r\n\r\nPlugin load code: https://github.com/harbby/sylph/blob/master/sylph-main/src/main/java/ideal/sylph/main/service/PipelinePluginLoader.java\r\n\r\nPlugin implementation code reference: ClickHouseSink: https://github.com/harbby/sylph/blob/master/sylph-connectors/sylph-clickhouse/src/main/java/ideal/sylph/plugins/clickhouse/ClickHouseSink.java\r\n   - Express the ClickHouseSink of type RealTimeSink by annotating Name and Description.\r\n   - Defined various parameters by extending PluginConfig's ClickHouseSinkConfig: jdbcUrl, user, password, query, bulkSize (bulkSize is int type, others are string), each parameter has Name and Description\r\n   - Support for defining multiple TaskTypes in a Plugin Jar. TaskType is divided into 3 categories: Source, Transform, Sink\r\n   - NOTE: For EasyScheudler, you should also consider I18N, so Name and Description should also let the plugin display multiple languages.\r\n   - NOTE: For EasyScheduler, there are many types of plugins, such as: Task type (sql task, shell task, etc.), JDBC Connector plugin (mysql, clickhouse, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe front end sets the plugin parameter: (This is because there is no local compilation/deployment, you can only look at the code). This code is in:\r\nhttps://github.com/harbby/sylph/blob/master/sylph-controller/src/main/webapp/app/js/etl.js#L27\r\n\r\nBut it just serializes the plugin's config into a json object, and then in the text box, the user modifies the specific parameters.\r\n  - NOTE: For EasyScheduler, we should be able to provide different UI presentations depending on the config type.\r\n  - NOTE: For EasyScheduler, we should be able to put various configs in different TabGroups, and then put each config into a different TAB, such as: basic information, \"JDBC information\", \"advanced configuration\", etc. \"\r\n\r\n---\r\n今天看到了一个一个新的项目, 这个代码比较简单, 其中也实现了基本的plugin, 代码写的还挺清楚的. 可以参考一下: (这个比StreamSets的代码少太多了, 也简单很多)\r\n\r\n\r\n参考了: https://github.com/harbby/sylph  Stream computing platform for bigdata \r\n\r\n插件使用了 https://github.com/harbby/gadtry 的 com.github.harbby.gadtry.classloader.DirClassLoader 来load plugins\r\n\r\n\r\nplugin加载代码: https://github.com/harbby/sylph/blob/master/sylph-main/src/main/java/ideal/sylph/main/service/PipelinePluginLoader.java\r\n\r\nplugin实现代码参考: ClickHouseSink: https://github.com/harbby/sylph/blob/master/sylph-connectors/sylph-clickhouse/src/main/java/ideal/sylph/plugins/clickhouse/ClickHouseSink.java\r\n   - 通过注解 Name 和 Description 来表述类型为 RealTimeSink 的 ClickHouseSink.\r\n   - 通过扩展 PluginConfig 的 ClickHouseSinkConfig 定义了各个参数: jdbcUrl, user, password, query, bulkSize (bulkSize为int类型, 其它为string),  各个参数都有 Name 和Description\r\n   - 一个Plugin Jar中支持定义多个TaskType, TaskType分为3大类: Source, Transform, Sink\r\n   - NOTE: 对于EasyScheudler, 应该还要考虑 I18N, 所以, Name 和 Description应该也要让插件显示多语言\r\n   - NOTE: 对于 EasyScheduler, 可以有多中类型的plugin, 比如: Task类型(sql任务, shell任务等), JDBC Connector plugin (mysql, clickhouse等)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n前端设置plugin参数:  (这个由于没有在本地编译/部署, 只能大概看看代码). 这个代码在:\r\nhttps://github.com/harbby/sylph/blob/master/sylph-controller/src/main/webapp/app/js/etl.js#L27\r\n\r\n但是它只是把plugin的config 序列化为一个json object, 然后在文本框中, 用户自己修改具体参数. \r\n  - NOTE: 对于EasyScheduler, 我们应该能根据不同的config类型, 提供不同的UI展示.\r\n  - NOTE: 对于EasyScheduler, 我们应该可以把各种config, 放在不同的 TabGroup中, 再界面上把各个config放到不同的TAB中, 比如: 基本信息, \"JDBC信息\", \"高级配置\" 等. 」\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/490332918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/490441692","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/263#issuecomment-490441692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/263","id":490441692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDQ0MTY5Mg==","user":{"login":"lgcareer","id":15651066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjUxMDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15651066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer","html_url":"https://github.com/lgcareer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgcareer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T10:55:29Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T10:55:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Stand-alone deployment is currently supported only on the Linux operating system.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/490441692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/490442121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/263#issuecomment-490442121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/263","id":490442121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDQ0MjEyMQ==","user":{"login":"itheima-cby","id":21357069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzU3MDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21357069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby","html_url":"https://github.com/itheima-cby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itheima-cby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T10:57:08Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T09:19:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"So, is there a relevant deployment document?

Re: [analysys/EasyScheduler] Hello author, I would like to ask, about the sub-process type can not run (#260)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSub process function is test successfully, we need more information for this issue, for example: some images and logs.\r\n \r\n-\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n我创建了一个工作流程，里面有两个任务，一个是task21，一个是子流程，子流程里面有两个任务，然后工作流实例如图，状态一直在运行状态\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n而任务实例则是只有第一个task是成功的，子流程是提交成功，\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker的日志是没有报相关信息，只有master日志报了一个错\r\n\r\n按照我的理解，一个工作流的command是一条记录，所以第一个task能成功，这里不知道我是否理解有误？\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------
