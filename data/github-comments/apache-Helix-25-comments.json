My reasoning for not adding unit tests was that there is currently no logic in Helix itself that uses these modes, and simply testing just the getMode() return values doesn't add much value. Moreover, testing the getMode() return values seems to be more of a Zookeeper test rather than a Helix test. But please let me know if these don't sound reasonable, I am open to adding tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1062576824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/1062859516","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1973#issuecomment-1062859516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1973","id":1062859516,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPIHxc4_WfL8","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-09T12:13:44Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T12:13:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
