We are now **tantalizingly close** on this one.  Recent PRs have done much to get the codebase to be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.  Note: this repo is ~90% Scala and only 1.5% Python but it does use Python is a few key areas.\r\n\r\nWe created a single Docker image that contained both Python 2 and Python 3 but that proved to be [too big](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1903#issuecomment-284717687) for daily use.  Therefore the sense is that we should transition to a world where **OpenWhisk majors in (defaults to) Python 3 and minors in Python 2**.\r\n\r\n**We would make [dockerskeleton](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/core/actionProxy/Dockerfile) into a Python 3 container.**\r\n\r\nFor those who use the wsk syntax:\r\n```\r\nwsk action create myaction mysnippet.py  # use dockerskeleton-based container\r\nwsk action create --kind python:3 myaction mysnippet.py  # use dockerskeleton-based container\r\nwsk action create --kind python:2 myaction mysnippet.py  # use python:2.7.12-alpine-based container\r\n```\r\nFor those who do _not_ use the CLI, OpenWhisk will just assume their code is Python 3 to be deployed on the Python 3-based dockerskeleton container.  It is not considered Pythonic to change file suffixes to .py2 and .py3 and reading file shebang lines is probably not worth the effort.\r\n\r\nTODOs (in rough order of execution):\r\n- [x] Finish making the code compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1987 (done)\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/2006 (done)\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1973 (closed in 2006)\r\n    - [x] https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/2007 (done)\r\n- [ ] Move dockerskeleton from Python 2.7.12 to 2.7.13 and update pip packages and docs\r\n    - [ ] https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1903 (ready for review)\r\n- [ ] Create a legacy Python docker image which matches the current dockerskeleton\r\n    - core/python2Action is now added to 1903 \r\n- [ ] Move dockerskeleton to Python 3.6 and update docs (go live)\r\n- [ ] Modify wsk to accept --kind python:2 and --kind python:3\r\n- [ ] Monitor usage and decide when to shut down legacy Python support\r\n\r\nAlso to consider: https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1940 ([venv](https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1940#issuecomment-284425619) vs. virtualenv), https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1867, and https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/pull/1510 \r\n\r\nAre there any Python 3-only PyPI modules that we should consider adding to the new dockerskeleton to provide folks an incentive to switch?  I would vote for [aiohttp](http://pythonhosted.org/aiohttp/client.html#aiohttp-client) (like requests on asyncio).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/285323326/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/285333988","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1983#issuecomment-285333988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1983","id":285333988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTMzMzk4OA==","user":{"login":"domdom82","id":1755853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTU4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1755853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82","html_url":"https://github.com/domdom82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdom82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-09T12:04:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T12:04:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"got runc to work on mac just fine.

Hopefully, having a license header in a file or two (where it does not much matter if it has one or not) should not be a showstopper for general license checking for Python.  If a file has one line of code that can be treated as \"IP\", again that would mean we are discussing only \"badcomment\", and it does not hurt having one there.  If we ever enable per-file exclusion, then we can delete it, but really no one will likely care if the test works going forward.\r\n\r\nPlanned on enabling .js license header checking after Python was done BTW (and add to every .js file) then go back to changing/checking for in existing supported languages (by file extension).
