What is new, what is old? Is it just style and build?\r\n \r\nAll of this is a complete copy of the words (no content changed) of the existing site. So I would not focus on the words. There were quite a few broken links on the site that I decided to fix and had to in order to enable the interlinking between the static docs and the versioned docs.\r\n\r\nSo, I would not be reviewing the actual words, or we'll be fixing the entire grammar and misspellings that already exist in the docs today. That will have it's own PR after this.\r\n\r\nThe best way to test this is to understand [the proposed build process and how it works](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/iceberg/tree/new-docs/docs-new#build-process), and [install it locally](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/iceberg/tree/new-docs/docs-new#install) to get a grasp of the mechanics involved in the deployment and see if you agree with it or have any concerns. You should also poke around a bit to verify I didn't break many permalinks.\r\n\r\nThis will not be deployed once merged, just give us an initial base for the new docs to work from. Later I will start working on the grammar fixes and adding [Vale, a prose linter](https://vale.sh/) that can abide by various grammar and style standards that we'd like to enforce. \r\n\r\nLet me know if this makes sense.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1741530893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1741542649","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/8623#issuecomment-1741542649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8623","id":1741542649,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85nzdT5","user":{"login":"danielcweeks","id":4925077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4925077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-29T22:17:30Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T22:17:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm a little hesitant to make this change to the spec because I feel the spec is pretty clear.

We can certainly use a faster/new hash algorithm. \r\n\r\n> * Should we make hash(str) and hash(int) the same to enable type promotion?\r\n\r\nCurrently, I don't think we can promote int to str due to the truncate/bucket(original) transform since we cannot produce same partition ing value. Unless we add more checks and restrictions about type promotion. \r\n\r\nI will also put more thinkings in this, and let's discuss after 1.4 is released .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1741674765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1741762554","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/8674#issuecomment-1741762554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/8674","id":1741762554,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85n0S_6","user":{"login":"rakesh-das08","id":16017562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDE3NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16017562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08","html_url":"https://github.com/rakesh-das08","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rakesh-das08/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-30T13:05:28Z","updated_at":"2023-09-30T13:05:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would like to see some more discussion around this.
