I think what we should do is drain the listener bus ourselves when SparkContext.stop() gets called -- so add waitUntiEmpty(some reasonable timeout) to LiveListenerBus.stop().  Does this seem right to you two, @andrewor14 and @pwendell

\n@andrewor14 helped me figure out it that its not too complicated to do it with reference queue. However, it does introduce another collection in the implementation (to store the WeakRefs), which is what is what I wanted to avoid (as we have to think about cleaning that up again, etc.). But introducing this HashMap is probably okay because it will get automatically cleaned as RDDs, shuffles, etc. go out of scope. The only scenario where this is not going to happen is in spark-shell where everything stays in scope. However, in that scenario, this collection is the least of the worries (it does not consume much memory or any other resources) as there are other bigger problems (RDD object accumulating in memory, etc.).

It just seems to me that people would only want to set this timeout to either 0 or infinity seconds. Setting it to anything in between is like trying to guess how long your listeners will finish processing an unknown number of events, which is quite hard. And if you guess it wrong, then the penalty is that you have to re-run your application and guess again.\n\nIf we decide to expose a public API anyway, I think it makes sense to expose it in a binary way (i.e. either you block on draining or you don't). In case there are undying listeners that keep the event bus thread from stopping, we can move `listenerBus.stop()` to the end of `sc.stop()` to ensure other SparkContext state gets cleaned

How much data do you cache/persist?\n\nFor code styles, please follow the Spark Code Style Guide and update your code. Major issues are\n1. use camelCase for variable names\n2. do not use infix except operators\n3. 2-space indentation\n4. use `map { case .. =>` instead of making a newline for `case .. =>`\n\nFor interfaces, we try to make the number of public interfaces minimal because we are going to maintain public APIs.

Mark, you're the Akka expert here -- should we be catching this\nexception using Akka's supervisor mechanism (\nhttp://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.1/scala/fault-tolerance.html) rather than\nour own try/catch?  It looks like that's the expected way to catch\nexceptions in an Akka actor?\n\nOn Tue, Mar 25, 2014 at 2:27 PM, Mark Hamstra notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Only if there is no rc2 :)\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/186#issuecomment-38623099\n> .\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38623473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/38623787","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/186#issuecomment-38623787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/186","id":38623787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjIzNzg3","user":{"login":"kayousterhout","id":1108612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1108612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout","html_url":"https://github.com/kayousterhout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kayousterhout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-25T21:33:45Z","updated_at":"2014-03-25T21:33:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@CodingCat, the problem with that is that the StopDAGScheduler event will\nget added to the queue, so it looks like the DAGScheduler can keep\nprocessing more events while it's in it's bad state, until the\nStopDAGScheduler event gets to the front of the queue?\n\nOn Tue, Mar 25, 2014 at 2:30 PM, Kay Ousterhout kayousterhout@gmail.comwrote:\n\n> Also, Mark, you're the Akka expert here -- should we be catching this\n> exception using Akka's supervisor mechanism (\n> http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.1/scala/fault-tolerance.html) rather\n> than our own try/catch?
