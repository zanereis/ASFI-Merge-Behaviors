MXNet was developed in an iterative matter, where operator is added when needed. You right that TF has the more operator coverage so far, but you and others can help to make mxnet better :)\n\nThe best way to improve this is open an issue for each operator needed, and we can work together to make it happen. This is not hard as imagined and it has been working for most of operators proposed c.f. #404  and other proposed ops, e.g. #215 \n\nFor example, if what you asked was dot product of matrix, it is already support by FullyConnected\n\n```\nresult = FullyConnected(A, B, no_bias=True) ;\n```\n\nIf you would like to propose something more, open an issue like Support Dot Operator, and propose what was needed, the developers and others will give suggestions on what can be done, usually involves 10 - 100 lines of c++ code, most of which can be copied from template, and once that is added, everyone benefit from your

I believe the best way forward is to consider a more general shape inference scheme that specifies dependencies explicitly.  This way an operator can state which information it needs to know in order to complete unspecified shape information.  For example, a simple method would be that the caller of `InferShape` can tell whether any change to the shapes have been made.  It calls `InferShape` for all operators repeatedly until no further change happens.  This would allow backpropagation of shape information so that we no longer need the `target_shape` parameter in the `Random` operator.\n2. **Parameters in MXNet are currently fixed size, independent of the batch size**.  When implementing something like stochastic variational Bayes we would need one (random) parameter per instance.  I am currently thinking of the best way to implement this in a generic manner.\n\n### Example\n\nAn example of how to use the code is\n\n```\nimport mxnet as mx\n\nR = mx.sym.Random(target_shape=(int(32),), random_type=\"gaussian\")\nA = mx.sym.Activation(data=R, act_type=\"relu\")\n\nA_exec = A.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args={})\nA_exec.forward()\nprint A_exec.outputs[0].asnumpy()\n```\n\nSorry for the redundant commits above, I am still getting used to github PRs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/161796587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/161813634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/575#issuecomment-161813634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/575","id":161813634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTgxMzYzNA==","user":{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T22:49:07Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T22:49:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@leocnj Three possible solutions you can try:\n\n(1) put the `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = ...` into `.bashrc`, then logout;\n\n(2) Startup RStudio from terminal by using `/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/RStudio`;\n\n(3) use `Sys.setenv` in RStudio before you load mxnet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/161813634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/161822772","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/811#issuecomment-161822772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/811","id":161822772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTgyMjc3Mg==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T23:28:38Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T23:29:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like you changed the default optimizer in LSTM.
