agree it would have been cleaner to not have to manually destruct the stats dictionary in the scheduler loop. However, I wasn't able to come up with a good way to automatically invalidate the cache after use. I noticed those individual stat methods are also used else where in the code base including the web, so I am concerned a manual refresh approach might introduce unexpected bugs in other places. I ended up with the current approach because it only adds one extra line in the scheduler loop, is more performant (dict lookup v.s. func call) and has less magic, i.e. easier to understand and maintain going forward. I figured this strikes a pretty good balance between performance and readability.

Read all the discussion and history but I have to say I'm not really a big fan of this approach. XCOM was designed for inter-task communication and should stay in that way. Reusing it for inside-task communication may just mix up these two purposes and introduce a maintainance headache. And we've already started to see a bit of that through the `include_prior_dates` case, yes we have a work around for that but to me that is a bit hacky and a start of more confusion. Similarly [the case from Sid](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1180#issuecomment-199526302). Bolke got a good point, idempotence needs to be guaranteed and I think the original way of clearing the XCOM is actually a pretty good way to ensure that.\r\n\r\nThat's not saying I'm against the idea behind it: having inside-task communication I think is important and can enable a lot more possibility. And I like the atomic change in this PR. But IMO there need to be something else that we use to approach the inside-task communication issue--tho maybe a bit more complicated but purer.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/547248960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/547254353","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4931#issuecomment-547254353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4931","id":547254353,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI1NDM1Mw==","user":{"login":"KyleJamesWalker","id":3707079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDcwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3707079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker","html_url":"https://github.com/KyleJamesWalker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KyleJamesWalker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T04:46:59Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T22:37:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm having the same issue but if I set the following:\r\n``` \r\nAIRFLOW__KUBERNETES_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES__AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY: \"xxx=\"\r\nAIRFLOW__KUBERNETES_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES__FERNET_KEY: \"xxx=\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe worker gets the variables set, but the key is lowercase, so it's not being picked up...\r\nSo airflow doesn't pick them up:\r\n```\r\nfernet_key: xxx=\r\nairflow__core__fernet_key: xxx=\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Previous env values did not have the `S` at the end of `VARIABLES`\r\n\r\nFor now, I added a hack and my DAG and it works just fine:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nif os.getenv('fernet_key'):\r\n    os.environ['FERNET_KEY'] = os.environ['fernet_key']\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to get these to be set with uppercase values?\r\n\r\nI'm assuming it's from here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/88989200a66291580088188f06a6db503ac823e2/airflow/configuration.py#L336-L339\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think this code should have a special check for the k8s env section, something like: \r\n``` python\r\n        section_prefix = 'AIRFLOW__{S}__'.format(S=section.upper())\r\n        for env_var in sorted(os.environ.keys()):\r\n            if env_var.startswith(section_prefix):\r\n                if section == \"kubernetes_environment_variables\":\r\n                    key = env_var.replace(section_prefix, '')\r\n                else:\r\n                    key = env_var.replace(section_prefix, '').lower()\r\n                _section[key] = self._get_env_var_option(section, key)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate we had to add the following for our k8s setup and it worked!!!

However, for efficiency, you might want to cache some state, and this can still be idempotent.\r\n\r\nMy case is that it just feels awkward to create a second table that does exactly the same as xcom.

I think we can narrow the scope of this change to meet this need without causing these undesired consequences.\r\n\r\nNamely: _only_ don't clear xcom when the task is resuming after a reschedule.\r\n\r\nWe might have to make changes to state during a poke reschedule because `up_for_reschedule` appears to be a short-lived status that quickly transitions to `up_for_retry`.\r\n\r\nBut an async operator, or a sensor in reschedule mode, could take on a \"hibernate\"-like state when waiting for reschedule time: something not occupying worker slot, but still considered part of the same task instance and same attempt -- so that idempotence is still respected. When merely being reanimated following a hibernate, xcom is not purged; when retrying after a failure, xcom is purged.\r\n\r\nI personally see value in this being configurable.  Suppose you have an incremental load process that utilizes batching and there's a failure.  By updating your progress through xcom, you could pick up where you left off; if it's always cleared, you'd have to start over.  We can support idempotent processes _and_ stateful processes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/547281122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/547287310","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6340#issuecomment-547287310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6340","id":547287310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzI4NzMxMA==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T07:12:06Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T07:12:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Have you run this in a Kube cluster?
