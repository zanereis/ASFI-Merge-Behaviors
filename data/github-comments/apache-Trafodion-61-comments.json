Maybe you could consider two things:\r\n\r\n- In addition to SHA, have a few more functions SHA2_256, SHA2_384, SHA2_512, with a single argument each. Those could be translated in the parser into the original SHA2 function, or you could use the ZZZBinderFunction method in the binder to do the translation. That has the advantage of showing the original function name in EXPLAIN.\r\n\r\n- If the second argument is a constant, then synthesize the output type appropriately.

PR change was attributed to DamagedWalException (DEW) seen in region server (RS) logs in Esgyn internal testing. This is primarily a client side change except that co-processors are always added as the table attribute when a trafodion table is created.  Prior to this change, the coprocessors are added when the attribute hbase.coprocessor.region.classes is not visible on the client side. This is the case with CDH distro. However, the service side configuration should continue to see the attribute hbase.coprocessor.region.classes set to regionObserver, endpoint coprocessor and AggregateCoprocesor classes both in CDH and HDP distros. It is possible that RS can be influenced in some way due to double loading of these classes. But, it was confirmed by @narendragoyal  that the DWE is seen even when the coprocessor is not added as the table attribute. \r\n\r\nI read the change again to check if something is amiss with this change.
