先说结论：local mode 当前节点的proxy只能发送到本地的broker中，cluster mode则proxy可以进行全局topic的路由。\r\n（小声蛐蛐：local proxy的proxy概念有点误导常规对proxy的理解）\r\n\r\n先用客户端尝试一下 指定proxy地址，选择当前分片上不存在的topic，看是否会转发到另外一个分片。\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8fe5e38-e87c-4ff4-b38d-3bd009dc7b50)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28baf92f-cbb1-4074-ad46-9f2fbadeafed)\r\n\r\n\r\n这里可以看到客户端发送消息失败。\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02272891-6a4f-40d4-b9af-1a696f96b989)\r\n\r\n跟踪客户端代码继续看，发现客户端报错是从proxy获取topicRoute报错，还没有走到sendMessage那一步，跟踪proxy代码，发现如下：\r\nLOCAL 模式下 获取topicRoute只从本地获取，所以客户端获取不到topic路由，然后终止发送消息。\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3734e836-6c66-4cd7-87d1-a50f7e04acf9)\r\n\r\nCLUSTER模式下 是从topicCache中获取路由信息，topicCache是从nameserver获取的路由信息。\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3ddafe1-4d02-479c-b252-36b9c0a4332d)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66d1db9-10da-4366-aa6f-2e981589c9e3)\r\n\r\n\r\n这个时候怀疑是不是proxy本身可以转发，但是由于客户端的缺陷或者是proxy提供route的api的问题导致无法发送成功。\r\n接下来，试一下直接调用grpc的sendmessage接口\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c0e34e6-8bf3-4f0a-975d-653837aa4aa5)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d425a80-c996-4160-9f76-aef100c5c684)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n#

> 队列模型里这个是预期内的，cache 中的 min offset 没有提交，导致看起来延迟很高，运行中实际上不影响后续消息消费，如果叠加负载均衡的影响，会有大量的重复。\r\n> \r\n> 是的，这里是预期内的。这里其实是想改一下检测消息消费超时的定时任务的时间间隔，目前配置的间隔和消息超时时间是一致的。会导致比如我配置的超时时间是 1h，那么有可能存在第一次定时任务检测时发现没有过期，需要再等 1h 才能判断是否过期的情况，因此实际超时时间成了 (1h, 2h]\r\n\r\n这里如果我们将消费超时时间配置为 1h, 检测间隔配置为 15min，实际过期时间最多只有 1h + 15min。消费就不会卡那么久了","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2553765865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2555991833","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/7668#issuecomment-2555991833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7668","id":2555991833,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl86YWVcZ","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-20T00:10:20Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T00:10:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
