And our current simple solution is to expand the `ResourceProfile` by adding the total number of input and output edges for `Execution`. Then the `ResourceManager` would calculate the buffer amounts based on that and overwrite the parameter value to `TaskManager` configuration.\r\n\r\nFrom @StephanEwen mentioned before, I know a little for this issue.
