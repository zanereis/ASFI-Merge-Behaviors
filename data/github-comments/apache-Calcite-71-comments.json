This problem is that every time the user sends the query sql of the point table and edge table to the Gremlinserver query server to complete the query, but the returned context needs to include GraphTraversalSource or TinkerGraph.\r\nOnly when any object is used as a data source can we perform graph traversal operations based on this, as shown below\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject result = acceptor.connect(Arrays.asList(Storage.toPath(ConfigureSupport.generateTempFileFromResource(this.getClass(), \"gremlin-server-integration.yaml\", \".tmp\")), \"session-managed\"));\r\n      TinkerGraph graph = (TinkerGraph) result;\r\n      GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal();\r\n      g.addVertex('name','stephen');g.addVertex('name','marko');g.traversal().V()\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that I need to implement a new driver, which is the GremlinRemoteDriver in the code listing, to obtain the GraphTraversalSource or TinkerGraph object.\r\nThis work will take up more time, I will continue to complete this PR after it is ready.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1905371932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1905433095","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3590#issuecomment-1905433095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3590","id":1905433095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5xkpoH","user":{"login":"snuyanzin","id":403174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzE3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/403174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/snuyanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snuyanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-23T07:19:08Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T07:19:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"closing since the PR was merged","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1905433095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1907201003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3640#issuecomment-1907201003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3640","id":1907201003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5xrZPr","user":{"login":"HanumathRao","id":5264087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5264087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao","html_url":"https://github.com/HanumathRao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HanumathRao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T01:32:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T01:32:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mihaibudiu, Please let me know if you have any further questions or clarifications on these changes.\r\n\r\n@libenchao and @rubenada, a friendly reminder to review the PR changes.

Cloud (formerly SonarCloud) is a SaaS code analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms.Your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues, on each merge/pull request.\r\n\r\nSonarQube Cloud integrates seamlessly into your GitHub workflow and provides clear guidance for resolving any code quality and security issues detected. The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available). SonarQube Cloud also integrates smoothly with Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, CirrusCI, and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA free tier is available that allows you to explore the benefits of SonarQube Cloud using your public and private repositories. We also provide a no-commitment, [14-day trial](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/signup/) of SonarQube Cloud Team for unlimited team members, up to 1.9M LoC, AI CodeFix recommendations, and more. No need to speak with a sales rep or request a license key - get automatic code analysis results on your private projects in minutes! Want to see more examples of SonarCloud in action?

If it doesn't, no problem, I'd like just to confirm if [CALCITE-6032](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-6032) and [CALCITE-5390](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5390) are / aren't due to same root cause.\r\n\r\nThanks @rubenada for the reply. I tried out the query in CALCITE-5390 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-5390) and they are not the same root cause. I can take a look at it later (post this JIRA merge), if no one is working on it. thanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1924399074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/1924584002","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/3663#issuecomment-1924584002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/3663","id":1924584002,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAUNjNM5yttJC","user":{"login":"mihaibudiu","id":19397042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzk3MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19397042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu","html_url":"https://github.com/mihaibudiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihaibudiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T19:54:12Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T19:54:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rubenada I have added a commented-out breaking change for the next release.
