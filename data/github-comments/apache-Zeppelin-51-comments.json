How about add some prefix on the property name, to distinguish from any other user defined properties? For example, like [zeppelin.interpreter.localRepo](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/remote/RemoteInterpreter.java#L150), i think `zeppelin.interpreter.resourcePoolClass` make sense. \n\nAnd how about add new configuration into [ZeppelinConfiguration](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/conf/ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L440) to set default value of resourcePoolClass globally through conf/zeppelin-env.sh and conf/zeppelin-site.xml

(either local or central (future)). \n\nUse,\n1) Zeppelin fetches all json file from Helium registry to list available Interpreters/NotebookRepo/Application \n2) Zeppelin dynamically loads jar when user selects from maven repository and run it based on information from helium registry.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/210727637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/210728757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/833#issuecomment-210728757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/833","id":210728757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDcyODc1Nw==","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-16T04:04:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-16T04:04:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ravicodder \nThanks for the patch.

Thanks for explaining what the problem is. But `interpreter-setting.json` doesn't include all of interpreters' settings. In case of Spark, `interpreter-setting.json` includes settings of `spark` group. I thought all interpreter with same group - or same jar - deploy at the same time with same jar. For more detail, if I adopt a new mechanism with JDBCInterpreter, I also write a new `interpreter-setting.json` inside a JDBCInterpreter jar or under {interpreter}/jdbc/. Does it makes sense?\n\nAnd about Helium, I've reviewed that codes, and get to know that it has a different structure and doesn't break current one, thus this PR doesn't conflict on registering interpreter. And I'm also willing to move forward to merge a new mechanism in Helium structure after Helium is merged.

[#6](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/6#issuecomment-185081090)\n\nAlso about extra UI space, its not an issue for using datatable or any of its functionality, but its general issue and to fix it we need to have a different PR...\n\nIf I look different notebook implementation, than the way they handle this issue is like below...\nThey are providing all buttons at bottom of table, and zeppelin provides same on top of table.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1140475/14640501/609d5802-065f-11e6-8bd3-1758181eb14d.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/211921573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/212004770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/841#issuecomment-212004770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/841","id":212004770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMjAwNDc3MA==","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-19T16:27:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T16:27:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not
