But then I was wondering if the failed unittest necessary, it seems acting like: \r\n- set a empty file's commitPosition to 100\r\n- append some mocked ConsumeQueue Buffer to it\r\n- `commitPosition` is larger than the size of `writeFileChannel`, commit failed\r\n\r\nIs it acceptable to remove step 1 in `consumeQueueTest`? @lizhimins 'cause the scenario seems nonexistent in production.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, `FileChannel.read()` has the same problem with `FileChannel.write()`, but to return a `ByteBuffer`, calling it looks like inevitable. I didn't find out how to use `FileChannel.transferTo()` to replace it completely. I'd like to use `MappedByteBuffer` as a alternative.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2056779446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/2058012470","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/6528#issuecomment-2058012470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6528","id":2058012470,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl856qsc2","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-16T00:07:34Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T00:07:34Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This
