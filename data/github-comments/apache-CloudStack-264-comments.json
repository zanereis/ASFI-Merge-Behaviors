We don't have the infrastructure set up for setting up multiple native physical networks, hence we took this approach.\r\n\r\nIs it ok we left this test under this nuage test module ?  Or would you like to see a new native component test.   Let me know what you think , i.e. whether what we did is fine or it is not what you had in mind. \r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/353046904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/353047032","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2208#issuecomment-353047032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2208","id":353047032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzA0NzAzMg==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-20T12:09:27Z","updated_at":"2017-12-20T12:09:27Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Packaging result: ✔centos6 ✔centos7 ✔debian.
