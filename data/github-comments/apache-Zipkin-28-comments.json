a lot for finding all these bugs!\nI fixed the \"Local Address\" bug, I think.\nThe ordering problem is probably due to implementation differences in browsers; stable vs unstable sort. Both the traces have duration 4 ms/4000 microseconds. V8 does unstable sort, Webkit does stable sort (I think), and Scala appears to do a bit of both, depending on the method used.\nI stabilised the sort by \"tie-breaking\" on trace ID, so if the durations are equal, we sort by trace ID.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/192866841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/comments/193028582","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1004#issuecomment-193028582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1004","id":193028582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MzAyODU4Mg==","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-07T01:11:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T01:11:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@eirslett I agree that the sort order thing isn't a useful signal as indeed any time I get that exception, the traces have the same duration.\n\nLGTM, so merge when ready!

My current best idea is to organize the jar in a way that there's clear separation between html files (especially `index.html` which needs special treatment in the handlers), and static assets. For example something like\n\n```\nzipkin-ui.jar\n  |\n  +-- html\n  |    |\n  |    +-- *.html\n  +-- assets\n       |\n       +-- *.css\n       +-- *.js\n```\n\nAnother option is to put just `index.html` in a special place, and let the static handler serve all other HTML files from the same source as all other static assets, adding `html => text/html` to the type map.\n\nAnother option is redesigning the way the handlers are structured, such that there's no need for special-casing `index.html`.\n\nAm I making sense? It's getting late, and this is the first time I'm messing around with Finagle.\n\nPS.

It's not even a bit HTML file, just enough boilerplate to be able to import the css/javascript code and bootstrap the application. Even if you go to a page like /dependencies, you will still get index.html from the server, but the javascript UI will look at `window.location` and figure out what to render based on
