I think you're mixing up what each of the ReportingTask methods do and not letting the framework help.\n\nThe flow of logic from the NiFi side is, the user will configure a period for the Reporting task to run. When they \"start\" the task the \"@OnScheduled\" method will be run. After that the framework will keep calling the \"ontrigger\" method, with the period the user set, in order to report. \n\nI believe what you want to do is to initialize the \"datadogReporter\" in the OnScheduled using the user defined properties and then in the onTrigger call the \"report\" method of \"datadogReporter\".\n\nI'd suggest reading through the Reporting Task section of the NiFi developer guide: \nhttps://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/developer-guide.html#reporting-tasks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233050104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233050712","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/655#issuecomment-233050712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/655","id":233050712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzA1MDcxMg==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-15T19:37:19Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T19:37:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Also doesn't DataDog use API keys in order to communicate?

Something like: \n\nif all completed by then, great, message gets acked, commited, client gets happy, but if message is partially processed (e.g. no returnCode when it hits the first wait above) test with resultCodeSetAndIsError and effectively treat it as success(commit) unless an error code is set?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233160641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233161189","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/483#issuecomment-233161189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/483","id":233161189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzE2MTE4OQ==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-17T02:11:34Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T02:11:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the complements.

They work in such way, that you register some metric and specify where to take the value of every metric from (line with `ConcurrentHashMap<String, AtomicDouble> metricsMap`). After that, DropWizard framework gets metric values from that structure with specified period of time. But i can report them manually as well. Should i do so?\n\n> Also doesn't DataDog use API keys in order to communicate? Shouldn't that be configured in the ReportingTask?\n\nIn order do deliver metrics to DataDog, the DataDog agent is used. It is the best way do to so. It collects metrics and events and reports them to DataDog. This approach doesn't require any of  API keys, but only agent installed.

This processor reaches out to the DB asking for the tables. Then for each table that isn't already stored in state it creates a flowfile. If the processor is configured to give the count, it needs to send a SQL query asking for it. If that query fails it will remove the flowfile it created and continue onto the next table. If successful, the FQN of the table will then be added to state (after queuing it to transfer).\n\nThat realization makes my comment about data loss void (was afraid it would get stored in state after un-successfully getting the count). \n\nOne new comment, would a user want to set an expiration for tables in state? That way they could get updates on the count of a table every X seconds/minutes. In it's current form it will get the table once but never again.

Firstly, it goes about aggregation. It is used to aggregate many data points from different sources (not only from NiFi) and send them. So if user is using DataDog for a lot of purposes it's obvious that it is more efficient to use such unified module as agent. Secondly, it works much faster than direct approach, because of accepting custom application metrics points over UDP.  The application won’t stop its actual work to wait for a response from the metrics server, which is very important if the metrics server is down or inaccessible. Thirdly, DataDog provides single-line install commands for every OS, so it is absolutely painless to install an Agent.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233365454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233368648","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/655#issuecomment-233368648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/655","id":233368648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzM2ODY0OA==","user":{"login":"Ramizjon","id":3027035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3027035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon","html_url":"https://github.com/Ramizjon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ramizjon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T15:44:46Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T15:44:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@JPercivall However, if you strongly recommend using direct approach, i can implement it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233368648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/233371681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/655#issuecomment-233371681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/655","id":233371681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzM3MTY4MQ==","user":{"login":"JPercivall","id":11302527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAyNTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11302527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall","html_url":"https://github.com/JPercivall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JPercivall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-18T15:54:20Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T15:54:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Ramizjon if there are signifiant improvements to do the local agent vs direct, I would suggest making it configurable.
