I expressed concerns that the pattern of opening and immediately closing transactions on `TransactionLegacy` was placing undue pressure on the underlying connection pool.  Upon re-review prompted by @abhinandanprateek, I realize that I misread the `open` method -- mistakenly concluding that it called `getConnection` causing a connection to be taken from the pool.  While it is an unclear, error-prone, and repetitive construct, this pattern is not placing undue pressure on the connection pool.  We can address the issue of transaction management (transaction boundaries should **not** be defined in a DAO and the appropriate abstractions/mechanisms) in a separate effort.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136950359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/136951585","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/765#issuecomment-136951585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/765","id":136951585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjk1MTU4NQ==","user":{"login":"wilderrodrigues","id":5129209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5129209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues","html_url":"https://github.com/wilderrodrigues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wilderrodrigues/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-02T06:37:07Z","updated_at":"2015-09-02T06:37:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I
