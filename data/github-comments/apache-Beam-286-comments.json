To have a decent CLI to expose this, we should support `--verbose` or `--debug` etc, so a user (or contributor) doesn't have to tweak a logging backend, which almost universally have terrible interfaces for one-off adjustments.

I had to deduce what it was you were actually fixing, and there seem to be a few unrelated improvements (which you could just leave in). Can you clarify which of these are the fix?\n\nI see these three seemingly independent changes:\n\n1. Using a concurrent `Set` implementation in `testWrite()`. But that test wasn't a problem AFAIK. The map isn't used concurrently, and the `join()` provides adequate memory barrier, I think... but certainly seems better style to use a concurrent structure across threads. (incidentally it is the deprecated style of thread launching)\n2. Joining the publisher thread before disconnecting. This seems like a very real fix.\n3. Using `QoS.EXACTLY_ONCE`. I didn't see errors that looked like duplication, but I agree that from the code it looks possible.\n\nTo be clear: all three seem like OK improvements but I'd love to know which are required and which are nice to have, etc.\n\n---\n\nReview status: 0 of 1 files reviewed at latest revision, all discussions resolved.\n\n---\n\n\n\n*Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/apache/beam/4406#-:-L2h0w07nlxV22MVG9FP:b-umh8ww)*\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/357397417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/357397596","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4406#issuecomment-357397596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4406","id":357397596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzM5NzU5Ng==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-13T01:15:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-13T01:15:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"<img class=\"emoji\" title=\":lgtm:\" alt=\":lgtm:\" align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"https://reviewable.io/lgtm.png\" height=\"20\" width=\"61\"/> though, because build breakage is more important than these clarifications.
