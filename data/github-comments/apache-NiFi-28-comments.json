Upon proper configuration for kerberos locally and on NiFi for each test case I did not encounter any issues related to kerberos authentication. I think it looks good for merge pending comments review/discussion.\n\nIn addition to the comment I made above, I was wondering, since now two types of keytabs could be referenced,  what's the potential that they could for different realms, e.g. Ranger existing Realm or different KDC then one used to authenticate users ? If so it may be useful to have documentation highlighting that krb5.conf may need to be adjusted for that case (multiple realms).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/240345313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/240380409","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/872#issuecomment-240380409","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/872","id":240380409,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDM4MDQwOQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T11:03:48Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T11:03:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@alopresto ok this is now fully up to date with master, full clean build w/contrib check solid.

I did it as a separate commit so that you can see the changes made. I also rebased against master.\n\nFixed issue where we were calling @OnUnscheduled methods before invoking SchedulingAgent.unschedule - that was a good catch. Also addressed the JavaDocs and ensured that we use the appropriate Nar ClassLoader.\n\nre: callback vs. passing in ScheduleState - I agree that both do have their pro's & con's. However, when I was reviewing the code I thought that it was quite difficult to follow, with the callback. The callback was only about 2-3 lines of code, and could easily just be moved into the StandardProcessorNode, and this made the code much more straight-forward to read and understand. Additionally, I do not consider it a leaky abstraction, given that this is the 'start' method of ProcessorNode, and this class's job is to handle the \"framework-y aspect of processors.\"\n\nShould we need to change it to use a callback in the future, we certainly can do so. If we do, though, I think we should create an interface that has a specific method whose name makes sense and is well documented rather than using a Callable<Boolean> to perform the operation & documenting how that Callable should operate in the JavaDocs for the method called. I think this is what really made it confusing to understand.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/240555549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/240556849","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/836#issuecomment-240556849","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/836","id":240556849,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDU1Njg0OQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-17T21:36:43Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T21:36:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Makes total sense to me.

Certainly you are right with the Jira that Binary types are currently not supported, and if the use case you describe (coming from Avro) is the most common, then this is clearly an improvement :)  Perhaps we could add this improvement and then write a Jira to handle the general case. Checking for a prefix is a decent approach but nothing will be bulletproof, such is the nature of being able to describe the type of the data vs being able to represent it when it must exist as a String (for attribute values). The workaround for byte literals in the interim could be to put them directly in the SQL statement (instead of attribute values).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/240902079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/240902982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/883#issuecomment-240902982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/883","id":240902982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDkwMjk4Mg==","user":{"login":"patricker","id":1015990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1015990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker","html_url":"https://github.com/patricker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-19T01:19:18Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T01:19:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think that supporting both would be nice, but there is a one in a million chance that someone will provide an Avro binary string that matches the hex validation checks causing data corruption...
