There's basically two approaches we can takes that (should) work.\r\n\r\n1. The current use of AutoTGT.  This requires setting up .storm/storm.yaml for the Storm nodes, and users will have to do the same.  Requires changes when nimbus.seeds change (adding/remove nimbuses)\r\n2. The AutoHDFS / AutoHBase solution mentioned by @dlyle65535.  This requires symlinking some jars and configs to make them available to Storm.  Should only be necessary for Nimbuses, but it does mean that HDFS/HBase upgrades can make the symlinks stale.\r\n\r\nEither solution requires Ambari acting on a different node (potentially) than the one running the scripts.  I don't know if Ambari has any resources for handling that sort of things.  It could potentially be a command over ssh to another node, but presumably that requires passwordless ssh setup or someone to manually create the symlinks (which may be acceptable for this pass).\r\n\r\nI'm fairly strongly inclined towards the second one, primarily because it requires less effort on the users part.

I wanted a rudimentary set of functional primitives, but there should be a follow-up to correct some issues with them around capability, such as supporting more complex data structures than lists (i.e. supporting `MAP({ 'key' : 'value', 'key2' : 'value2' }, (k,v) -> JOIN([k, v], ':'))` should be `['key:value', 'key2:value2'])`).  In that case, it wouldn't assume a single argument.\r\n\r\nOh, also, we do actually validate before a zookeeper push all stellar statements. It will fail if you botch the stellar.  I'm looking forward to a proper UI around stellar, though, for sure. :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/292718817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/292733718","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/517#issuecomment-292733718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/517","id":292733718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjczMzcxOA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-08T17:39:01Z","updated_at":"2017-04-08T17:39:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jjmeyer0 Thanks so much for the review.
