With the ConsumerBuilder, users should get a PulsarClient exception if they want to enable DLQ on a Key_Shared subscription.\r\n\r\nAdded check in ConsumerBuilder to throw InvalidConfigurationException if set DeadLetterTopic name for KeyShared subType.\r\n\r\n\r\n> The same logic exists in the void messageReceived method. Is it better for us to prohibit setting this kind of policy in the builder ?\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> if (deadLetterPolicy != null && possibleSendToDeadLetterTopicMessages != null && redeliveryCount >= deadLetterPolicy.getMaxRedeliverCount()) {\r\n>     possibleSendToDeadLetterTopicMessages.put((MessageIdImpl)message.getMessageId(), Collections.singletonList(message));\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> There is retry logic in `deadLetterPolicy`. If the number of retries is exceeded, how to deal with these messages? But the `retryLetterProducer` in `consumerImpl` doesn't seem to do any processing.\r\n\r\nFor first point, there's a check `possibleSendToDeadLetterTopicMessages != null` and I've make possibleSendToDeadLetterTopicMessages = null if it's KeyShared subType which is the behavior if DeadLetterPolicy is not provided. (It's safe as we are already doing null check every time we want to use possibleSendToDeadLetterTopicMessages)\r\nFor second point, actually we need both check. The check in ConsumerBuilder will prevent user from setting DeadLetterTopic.\r\nHowever, even if we don't set DeadLetterTopic(e in DeadLetterPolicy, in ConsumerImpl wether to put message in DLQ is currently decided by `if  reconsumetimes > this.deadLetterPolicy.getMaxRedeliverCount()` so additional check will still be needed here as we want retry but not DLQ for Key_Shared subType.\r\nEither by checking if subType == Key_Shared or if StringUtils.isBlank(deadLetterPolicy.getDeadLetterTopic()). I just pick the former cause it make our purpose more clear.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/758442219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/758461681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8781#issuecomment-758461681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8781","id":758461681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODQ2MTY4MQ==","user":{"login":"nodece","id":16235121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM1MTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16235121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece","html_url":"https://github.com/nodece","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodece/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-12T07:23:13Z","updated_at":"2021-01-12T07:23:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tuteng
