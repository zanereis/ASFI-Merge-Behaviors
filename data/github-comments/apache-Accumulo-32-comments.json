A fluent builder was added to the new code to make it easier to set all the properties on a map reduce job. So now a job can be configured in one line like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nAccumuloOutputFormat.configure().clientProperties(props).batchWriterOptions(bwConfig)\r\n      .defaultTable(name).createTables(true) // disabled by default\r\n      .simulationMode(true) // disabled by default\r\n      .store(job);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe tests from the old code were copied over to the new package in hadoop-mapreduce.  But there are tests missing for some of the options.  We want to have tests for all of the new builder methods for 2.0.  Tests can be added to existing ones in hadoop-mapreduce/src/test/java/org/apache/accumulo/hadoop or it may be better to have new unit tests that just test the fluent API directly.  \r\n\r\nHere are some more methods that are missing tests:\r\n- OutputFormatBuilder -> createTables\r\n- OutputFormatBuilder -> clientPropertiesPath","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/479533873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/479564844","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/811#issuecomment-479564844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/811","id":479564844,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTU2NDg0NA==","user":{"login":"jzgithub1","id":5930146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5930146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1","html_url":"https://github.com/jzgithub1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzgithub1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T16:33:32Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T16:33:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The Jeffs are looking at this now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/479564844/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/479591557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1072#issuecomment-479591557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/1072","id":479591557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3OTU5MTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-03T17:48:49Z","updated_at":"2019-04-03T17:48:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One thing I've found about security alerts: if you dismiss them, you cannot un-dismiss them, so let's be sure that's what we want to do before they are dismissed.
