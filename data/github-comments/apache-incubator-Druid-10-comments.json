It was pretty hard to integrate and ended up breaking some unit tests because the \"null handling\" logic can take a lot more into account when it is defining \"correct\" behavior while creating a blanket \"null column\" doesn't.\n\nOne of the big places that this showed up was in the differences between how metric and dimension columns are treated.  With just a `null` they can be treated \"correctly\" separately from each other, which is not as simple with a column that returns nulls.\n\n@drcrallen hopefully that resolves the `null` versus \"empty object\" thing.  Fwiw, you define the semantics of `null` as \"error\" or \"empty\", neither of which are the semantics I assign to it.  `null` means \"does not exist\" as in, the thing you asked for does not exist.  Given the knowledge that the thing you asked for doesn't exist, you can do something meaningful.\n\nOn the question of \"if you pass nulls, now I have to check for them\" if you are working in Java and you are operating with Objects you should **_always**_ be doing null checks.  I don't care if it's an `Optional<>` that you got returned, that can still be `null` and generate an NPE.  In fact, null checks are the cheapest conditional you can do in Java because they expected them to be done so much.  The vast majority of time the check is done when loading the actual reference.\n\nLastly, I'm do not understand what you are trying to say with\n\n> Additionally, as per the SQL example mentioned previously, it helps if we have just one representation that is not confusing to folks coming from other data stores.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/68195833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/68211581","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/978#issuecomment-68211581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/978","id":68211581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjExNTgx","user":{"login":"flowbehappy","id":2639319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzkzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2639319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy","html_url":"https://github.com/flowbehappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flowbehappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-28T16:26:22Z","updated_at":"2014-12-28T16:26:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree to the terms of the Druid Individual CLA as it exists in the current master branch. \n\nbtw, I think I already did that before :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/68211581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/68217344","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/995#issuecomment-68217344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/995","id":68217344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjE3MzQ0","user":{"login":"sharrissf","id":308039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODAzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/308039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf","html_url":"https://github.com/sharrissf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sharrissf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-28T19:49:45Z","updated_at":"2014-12-28T19:49:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@cheddar Hi, I haven't looked at the code but from your description it sounded like it might be a case where double dispatching might work well.

I.e. instead of\n\n```\nImmutableMap.of(null, 'billy');\n```\n\nYou can do\n\n```\nnew LinkedList(){{ put(null, \"billy\"); }};\n```\n\nAnd it will work.
