@tonybaloney for that feedback.

To me that require a bigger change (maybe compltely worthed, but as I am new to the project, I prefer to ask).\n\nThanks again for your help,\nLionel\nPS: I'll check also the UT failure ;)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/160057193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/160066460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/642#issuecomment-160066460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/642","id":160066460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDA2NjQ2MA==","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T08:21:14Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T08:21:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lkoenig everything in base.NodeDriver is meant to be overridden, if you don't override it, normally there is a NotImplementedError to catch you. \nIn the case of the Azure driver it looks like it doesn't match up the arguments correctly, so you want to override deploy_node with your own implementation.\n\nHere's an example creating a node with Azure https://github.com/mistio/mist.io/blob/master/src/mist/io/methods.py#L2315 \n\nIs it deploy_node you want to use or create_node?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/160066460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/160089434","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/642#issuecomment-160089434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/642","id":160089434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDA4OTQzNA==","user":{"login":"lkoenig","id":420657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDY1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/420657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig","html_url":"https://github.com/lkoenig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T09:28:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T09:28:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I would like to leverage the deploy_node method of the drive.\nAccording to the documentation of deploy_node, one should not overwrite that method\nAs stated line 829 of libcloud/compute/base.py:\n\n```\n       Deploy node is typically not overridden in subclasses.

Sadly some of the old / legacy code doesn't do that, but we should avoid adding more debt in the future when possible.\n\nThere are two things we could do:\n1. Leave `create_node` signature as it is and also add `**kwargs` to the end\n2. Update / fix `deploy_node` so it doesn't pass `deploy_node` specific arguments to `create_node`. We could probably do something simple like this:\n\n``` python\ncreate_node_kwargs = copy.deepcopy(kwargs)\n# remove all the deploy_node specific arguments from create_node_kwargs\nnode = create_node(**create_node_kwargs)\n```\n\nI think second option is the way to go. First one makes it work, but it doesn't really solve the \"kwargs abuse\" problem - method will just silently take in all the additional arguments and ignore them (that makes for a very bad, confusing and unfriendly API).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/161526460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/161536780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/642#issuecomment-161536780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/642","id":161536780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTUzNjc4MA==","user":{"login":"lkoenig","id":420657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDY1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/420657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig","html_url":"https://github.com/lkoenig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkoenig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T07:08:32Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T07:08:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the inputs.

I just asked to inquire which was the roadmap regarding this topic - for Container-as-a-Service providers.\n\nBut, if you allow me to say this, before anyone start this undertaking, why don't start small? First discuss the acceptance of this PR... as @tonybaloney and @mgogoulos states, this works perfectly for their use-case scenario (which, I assume, is deploy instances/nodes regardless of the provider).\nAfter, that the community and the Libcloud team could start the discussion of a more serious a well-developed solution regarding that alongside this there are some consortiums discussing standards for containers.\n\nAfter reading, @tonybaloney last post, I still does not have a well defined opinion, because I'm questioning (because I'm not seeing at first) what is the major differences that requires a differente object Driver for Containers?\n\nTo finalize, IMHO, I think that considering Docker as a provider of Libcloud is not that farfetch, because, I may be wrong, but you support Digital Ocean and other providers which works with Docker Daemon/Client to deploy containers. \nSource:
