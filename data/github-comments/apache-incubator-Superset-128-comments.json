have a cell-measuring utils function somewhere on our side too. \r\n\r\nI think it gets tricky. Picture a report with a wide HDFS folder locations as in `/hive/warehouse/default/fact_rides/20180101/file234872948298` and one metric (say `megabytes`). You clearly don't want a wrapped `HDFS folder` to accommodate a 50% width metric.\r\n\r\nThough I do like the idea of having consistently sized metrics where one metric doesn't look arbitrarily more important than another one just because the label is wider. It could be interesting to see how browsers do it (proportion based on max(width)? proportion based on avg(wdith)?). I'm guessing it's a bit fuzzy and might generally look better than a simpler `width/num_columns`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/376726613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/376731587","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4669#issuecomment-376731587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4669","id":376731587,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjczMTU4Nw==","user":{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T01:41:52Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T01:41:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@mistercrunch would we need to mock the Presto connection?

think this results in double-checking the permission at the moment, which is an extra database round trip. I'm not sure how efficient it is either for non-all-datasource-access roles, meaning we'd pay a relatively expensive cost twice.\r\n\r\nCurrently the view is in charge of doing data access checks. Since the auth scheme here is a FAB (web framework) construct, it could be good to keep those check shallow in the stack, meaning in the view layer.\r\n\r\nCurious to understand your use case and how the check on cache would differ from the datasource check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/377083886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/377084315","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4663#issuecomment-377084315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4663","id":377084315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzA4NDMxNQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T00:43:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T00:43:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"![napo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/487433/38063728-79637ba4-32af-11e8-8277-ad65428b69fb.gif)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/377084315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/377084979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/4669#issuecomment-377084979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4669","id":377084979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzA4NDk3OQ==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T00:47:23Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T00:47:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes you're right there would be mocking involved.
