A key part of the architecture is whether an event loop belongs on an executor and/or on workers; AFAIK, an executor could manage an event loop and all the \"tasks\" that it runs need to be compatible with asyncio/coroutine behavior (and non-blocking libraries need to be used for db access etc).  Note that the branch name for this PR might have started out with an intention to apply asyncio to an executor, but it winds up applying at the worker level, so the executor is not managing an event loop that all the workers share.  There could be something important in that.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the primary point of interest and/or confusion is in\r\n```\r\nfoo = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(\r\n                *command,\r\n                stdin=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                loop=self.loop\r\n            )\r\n```\r\nvs. using an awaitable coroutine or task as in the sequence diagram noted in\r\n- https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/asyncio-task.html#example-chain-coroutines\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n- https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/asyncio-dev.html#asyncio-multithreading\r\n- https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/asyncio-dev.html#handle-blocking-functions-correctly\r\n\r\nBy using a subprocess, does that mean the `command` itself has no ability to use asyncio coroutines - is that right?  That's not entirely a bad thing if this PR intends to do so (or that's just how it has to be because the `command` ecosystem is not compatible with asyncio), but if that's correct, then it could mean that this worker could spawn a lot of processes that are all blocking within each process.  I just wonder whether it really differs from using multiprocessing in this regard.  Should this worker use some kind of asyncio process pool (or is that implicit already)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570269996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570281992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5788#issuecomment-570281992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5788","id":570281992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDI4MTk5Mg==","user":{"login":"dazza-codes","id":240623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDYyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes","html_url":"https://github.com/dazza-codes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dazza-codes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T17:39:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T18:08:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @ash recently made some changes to the LocalExecutor to use os.fork instead of processes, this makes the multithreading in the LocalExecutor much faster and lighter weight.\r\n\r\nThat's curious.  AFAIK, `os.fork` is a child process, not a thread.

I believe adding anything to `__init__.py` makes only sense if we provide a reusable library with one package - when if you import it, you should have access to all exposed functions. \r\n\r\nI am happy to discuss it though, as we might have different understanding - and maybe we should expose all \"exposable\" classes from unit in this way as part of the \"official airflow interface\" (but I still think import should be `from airflow.utils.xxx import yyy` anyway).\r\n\r\nJust to summary - we have two options:\r\n\r\n1. Import airflow and then rely on the __init__ packages\r\n```\r\nimport airflow\r\n```\r\nand then using\r\n```\r\nairflow.utils.dates.days_ago(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Import the function directly (much better IMHO).\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 1 (with importing the whole 'airflow').\r\n\r\n<img width=\"486\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-01-02 at 23 16 23\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/71696745-13efc580-2db6-11ea-855c-25ca7901ff49.png\">\r\n\r\nOption 2: (wiht importing only the function we need)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"489\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-01-02 at 23 09 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/71696484-5d8be080-2db5-11ea-8403-49a845a25510.png\">\r\n\r\nWDYT @kaxil?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570373212/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570388793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6850#issuecomment-570388793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6850","id":570388793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDM4ODc5Mw==","user":{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T22:59:40Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T23:07:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@baolsen \r\n> I really feel that SQL Alchemy might be useful here. Using different dialects allows us to be backwards compatible and let the user decide whether to use pymssql or pyodbc (with the extra effort that it requires).\r\n\r\nit's an interesting idea but i think it actually increases complexity to go that way.  then your hook logic, and the design of your connection object parsing, has to be able to handle arbitrary mssql libraries. \r\ne.g. with pyodbc we can supply arbitrary odbc connection properties as key-value in conn.extra.  what would you do with these in pymssql?    you could do it, but i think it is cleaner and safer to keep things separate.\r\nand where in the conn object would you put the dialect selector?\r\nyou'd still have to have a extra option for odbc support at install to enable pyodbc.\r\nand it while this could potentially be used for switching between pyodbc and pymssql, it could not be used for turbodbc or bcp.\r\n\r\nand i think that might be why conventionally in airflow it's the other way around -- hooks are defined in accordance with the idiosyncrasies of their connectors, and they can optionally generate a sqlalchemy connection.  and this PR does provide support for that here: (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1b3b907ed6e8a45affa269b624dfe420d74424ed/airflow/providers/mssql/hooks/mssql_odbc.py#L156)\r\n(the `get_uri` method is used by dbapi hook to produce sqlalchemy engine; i also provide a get_sqlalchemy connection method)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570388793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/570424113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6342#issuecomment-570424113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6342","id":570424113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDQyNDExMw==","user":{"login":"houqp","id":670302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDMwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp","html_url":"https://github.com/houqp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-03T01:06:32Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T01:06:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@ashb
