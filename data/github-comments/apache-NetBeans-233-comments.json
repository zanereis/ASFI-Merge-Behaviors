This is hardly acceptable for any developer.\n* I do NOT want to start a formatting war, I have been in too many with .NET fans, and it is useless. I want just to stick to the preferred project settings (if any). \n\nIt would be sufficient if one of the regular committers like Neil or Michael would simply export their settings \ninto a file in some well-known place in the repo and call it preferred settings. Root or a subdir would be fine. Then I could pick it up and easily conform to those settings. If I would add those settings to specific sub-projects, I will add them to .gitignore.\n\nI must say that in some places the formatting of some sources is really off, making comprehensibility a lot harder, and impairing work on bug resolution.

I also have no use for a code preview in this very narrow section for usages and search results.\nBut what makes the new preview in the Usages window really frustrating is that it seems to interfere with the function of the Previous Occurence and Next Occurence buttons and their corresponding shortcuts. These currently no longer have any effect on the editor window but only on the preview window.\nThis destroys my otherwise constantly used workflow of jumping directly to the next match in the editor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2597227849/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/2597837456","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/8152#issuecomment-2597837456","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/8152","id":2597837456,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M6a19qQ","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-17T09:47:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T09:47:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"release

The spec version and the major module version are not linked. Nothing is stopping you from going from `org.netbeans.libs.fabric8/1` with spec version `1.11` to `org.netbeans.libs.fabric8/1` with spec version `2.0`, while you most probably wanted to go to  `org.netbeans.libs.fabric8/2` with spec version `2.0`.
