It appears that if you define a squared loss function (as in example above), the network outputs approximations for y^2 (where y is the target of regression).\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this consider the example below, in which I train 4 networks to perform simple polynomial regression. The first is using `nnet` just as a sanity check. The second (top-right) uses an `mxnet` `LinearRegressionOutput` layer. The third (bottom-left) uses a `MakeLoss` layer as defined above with a `mx.symbol.square` loss function, and the fourth (bottom-right) uses a `MakeLoss` layer with a `mx.symbol.sqrt(mx.symbol.sqare())` loss function.\r\n\r\nOn all plots I have included a y=x (perfect fit) line (red), and on the third plot I have included a y=x^2 line (blue). As you can see the model trained with a square loss function appears to output the square of the response. This does not make sense to me, is it expected behaviour? If so my understanding of how `MakeLoss` works is very poor.\r\n\r\nPlots:\r\n![mxnet_regression_makeloss](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1239386/21376637/e0e46090-c78a-11e6-8a54-17bee881dcbb.png)\r\n\r\nRMSE results:\r\n```\r\n$nnet\r\n[1]

possible explanation from what I can see (keep in mind I don't understand the internal workings of `mxnet` very well) is that when a `MakeLoss` layer is used, the output of a call to `predict` is not the desired network response (`pred`), but rather the loss function itself when a label of zero is assumed.\r\n\r\nThis is made a little clearer if we normalize (to zero mean and unit variance) the data of the excellent `MakeLoss` example which @thirdwing wrote ([link to that example](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/docs/tutorials/r/CustomLossFunction.md)). Details of this example included below.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case then what we really want when we call `predict` is to extract the data from the `fc2` layer (or whatever is the last layer before we start computing the loss function). Is there a way to do that so I can check?\r\n\r\nThe plots from this example are shown below:\r\n![mxnet_regression_squared_bostonhousing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1239386/21378319/ad1b979c-c799-11e6-9433-15bf8b9eba2e.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the code used to produce these plots (based on the BostonHousing example provided by @thirdwing) is pasted below\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Custom loss function tutorial from:\r\n# https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/docs/tutorials/r/CustomLossFunction.md\r\n\r\n# Network config\r\noptimizer <- \"rmsprop\"\r\nbatchSize <- 100\r\nnRounds <- 500\r\nnormalize <- TRUE\r\nnHidden <- 14\r\nverbose <- FALSE\r\narray.layout <- \"rowmajor\"\r\n\r\nlibrary(mxnet)\r\ndata(BostonHousing, package=\"mlbench\")\r\nif (normalize) {\r\n  BostonHousing[, sapply(BostonHousing, is.factor)] <- \r\n    as.numeric(as.character(BostonHousing[, sapply(BostonHousing, is.factor)]))\r\n  BostonHousing <- data.frame(scale(BostonHousing))\r\n}\r\ntest.ind = seq(1, 506, 5)    # 1 pt in 5 used for testing\r\ntrain.x = data.matrix(BostonHousing[-test.ind, -14])\r\ntrain.y = BostonHousing[-test.ind, 14]\r\ntest.x = data.matrix(BostonHousing[--test.ind, -14])\r\ntest.y = BostonHousing[--test.ind, 14]\r\ndata <- mx.symbol.Variable(\"data\")\r\nfc1 <- mx.symbol.FullyConnected(data, num_hidden=nHidden)\r\ntanh1 <- mx.symbol.Activation(fc1, act_type=\"tanh\")\r\nfc2 <- mx.symbol.FullyConnected(tanh1, num_hidden=1)\r\nlro <- mx.symbol.LinearRegressionOutput(fc2)\r\nmx.set.seed(0)\r\nmodel <- mx.model.FeedForward.create(lro,\r\n                                     X=train.x, y=train.y,\r\n                                     eval.data=list(data=test.x, label=test.y),\r\n                                     ctx=mx.cpu(), num.round=nRounds,\r\n                                     array.batch.size=batchSize,\r\n                                     eval.metric=mx.metric.rmse,\r\n                                     optimizer=optimizer, verbose=verbose,\r\n                                     array.layout=array.layout)\r\n\r\nlro2 <- mx.symbol.MakeLoss(mx.symbol.square(\r\n  mx.symbol.Reshape(fc2, shape = 0) -

I have managed to work this out by following the example for extracting the data from internal layers in R given [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1152).\r\n\r\nBelow is some example code which trains an linear regression model using `LinearRegressionOutput` layer, and then trains another using a `MakeLoss` output with `square`-error loss function.\r\n\r\nFor the `MakeLoss` model a `mx.symbol.Group` and an executor are used to perform the forward pass of the network for extracting the `pred` (network response) for plotting purposes. Results between the two models are similar as one might hope.\r\n\r\nIf someone with some more mxnet experience (@thirdwing, @piiswrong, @Lodewic) could give the code below a quick check, I would be happy to update the `MakeLoss` example given [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/docs/tutorials/r/CustomLossFunction.md) and submit a PR.\r\n\r\nA few things which feel a little hacky about my implementation below:\r\n\r\n1. I have created separate train and test executors for plotting the train and test data\r\n2. In a number of places I have to transpose my `data` presumably because of a [examples x features] VS [features x examples] conflict somewhere (elsewhere I have seen this more elegantly handled by setting the `array.layout` argument... but that didn't seem available here?\r\n3. Is there some way we could modify `MakeLoss` and/or the behaviour of `predict` to do this automatically? When people specify a loss layer they will still expect their network to output a response (not the loss of that response with a zero label).\r\n\r\nPlots:\r\n![mxnet_regression_square_loss_extract](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1239386/21380040/7a20d5e8-c7a6-11e6-9499-d1b2ec1ce27e.png)\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```\r\n# Custom
