The only concern for those situations would be if we violate a contract, like we generate a random number that is not within the range specified by the API, or we deadlock, etc.  Looking at the code here we will never violate those constraints.  The worst thing that happens is that we may repeat some \"random\" numbers in different threads because the compiler cached the seed in a local register and didn't write back to memory.  For me the extra performance can outweigh the less then ideal situation.</p>\n\n<p>    Looking at ThreadLocalRandom, they are using unsafe operations and I don't know enough about the internal implementation to feel comfortable saying if it will or will not violate any of the constraints, but I don't think it will.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612888450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/200497814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1195#issuecomment-200497814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1195","id":200497814,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMDQ5NzgxNA==","user":{"login":"knusbaum","id":1819836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTk4MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1819836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum","html_url":"https://github.com/knusbaum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-23T19:03:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T19:04:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@hustfxj \nBy using gauges we're re-implementing stuff that coda hale does, namely windowed stats.

Whereas it is quite  significant on the one i used.  <br/>\n    My current topology is implemented to run within the storm-benchmark tool.  I can rewrite that as a regular topology so you can run it easily to validate.. OR, if you are comfortable running it, i can share it as is more quickly.</p>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612885652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612888974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5489#issuecomment-2612888974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5489","id":2612888974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4ODg5NzQ=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-24T03:08:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:09:48Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=githubbot\">githubbot</a>:</i>\n<p>GitHub user HeartSaVioR opened a pull request:</p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1251\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1251</a></p>\n\n<p>    <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1654\" title=\"HBaseBolt creates tick tuples with no interval when we don&#39;t set flushIntervalSecs  \" class=\"issue-link\" data-issue-key=\"STORM-1654\"><del>STORM-1654</del></a> HBaseBolt creates tick tuples with no interval when we don't set flushIntervalSecs</p>\n\n<p>    Please also refer #893 to see why this change is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>    Set 'default' flush interval seconds to HBaseBolt, since taking half of message timeout secs doesn't work, as #893 showed.<br/>\n    Since we should hardcode default flush interval seconds for now, I think we can change default flush interval to 1s since I guess it's enough for HBase, and anyone never set up tuple timeout seconds to 1.
