And we should and this featrue to master branch.\r\n\r\nI think function in `helper` mean **help you, and make it easy**. Image some situation, we should  make couple of similar task in ONLY upstream and downstream dependent. We could use code like\r\n\r\n```py\r\nt1 = DummyOperator(task_id='t1', dag=dag)\r\nt2 = DummyOperator(task_id='t2', dag=dag)\r\n...\r\ntn = DummyOperator(task_id='tn', dag=dag)\r\nt1 >> t2 >> ... >> tn\r\n```\r\nor we just using function `chain`\r\n```py\r\nlist_for_task = [DummyOperator(task_id='t{}'.format(i), dag=dag) for i in range(1, n + 1)]\r\nchain(*list_for_task)\r\n```\r\nI prefer the second way rather than the first one.\r\n\r\nOne classic situation in my daily use is in data house, I want to transfer couple of Hive table and LOAD to different output system. I do like\r\n```py\r\nprepare_dw_table_for_ana_system = [\r\n    'prepare_step_1',\r\n    'prepare_step_2',\r\n    'prepare_step_3',\r\n    'prepare_step_4',\r\n]\r\ntasks_prepare_dw_table_for_ana_system = [\r\n    HiveOperator(\r\n        task='prepare_dw_table_for_ana_system_{}'.format(step),\r\n        sql='{}.sql'.format(step),\r\n        dag=dag\r\n    ) for step in prepare_dw_table_for_ana_system\r\n]\r\n\r\ndiff_system_adapter = [\r\n    'system_1',\r\n    'system_2',\r\n    'system_3',\r\n    'system_4',\r\n]\r\ntasks_diff_system_adapter = [\r\n    HiveOperator(\r\n        task='diff_system_adapter_{}'.format(system),\r\n        sql='{}.sql'.format(system),\r\n        dag=dag\r\n    ) for system in diff_system_adapter\r\n]\r\n\r\npost_step = [DummyOperator(task_id='post_step_{}'.format(i), dag=dag) for i in range(3)]\r\n\r\nchain(*tasks_prepare_dw_table_for_ana_system, tasks_diff_system_adapter, *post_step)\r\n```\r\nI think make task in list could make the job more significative, because sometime we use muliti step to do one thing, and I want I refactor DAG just have to know what group tasks `tasks_prepare_dw_table_for_ana_system` mean, rather than each single task like `prepare_dw_table_for_ana_system_xxx` mean\r\n\r\nSo, I don't think we should remove function `chain`. And we should let `chain(t1, t2, [t3, t4, t5], t6)` work in `chain`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/467694805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/467710914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4459#issuecomment-467710914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4459","id":467710914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NzcxMDkxNA==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-27T03:35:32Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T03:44:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#
