At the same time we still keep the installCatalog.sh to install the packages, which are still in openwhisk.\n\nIn the ansible file postdeploy.yml, we can add installExtraCatalog.sh, so that after running installCatalog.sh, we can run installExtraCatalog.sh. In this case, we can make sure that no package is missed during the transition from openwhisk/catalog to openwhisk-catalog. It is possible that some packages are installed twice(e.g. openwhisk-catalog has merged that package with tests, but openwhisk has not deleted it yet), but I think it is better than some packages missing in this transition.\n\nHow to break the circular dependency? \nThe good approach can be we create a new separate repo to host the install scripts. Go to <openwhisk_home> to install openwhisk and then go to <openwhisk_catalog_home> to install the catalogs based on openwhisk. **However**, since our install scripts still exist in openwhisk, we can use an additional parameter for openwhisk.yml, e.g. withExtraCatalog and withoutExtraCatalog, to determine whether to clone the openwhisk-catalog repo or not.\n\nBy default, openwhisk.yml will install the extraCatalog from openwhisk-catalog(we can change to withoutExtraCatalog for the default value if possible):\n\n```\nansible-playbook -i environments/local openwhisk.yml \nansible-playbook -i environments/local openwhisk.yml -e mode=withExtraCatalog or something similar\n```\n\nThe above commands behave the same.\n\nWhile we are able to choose the installation withoutExtraCatalog to skip the catalog installation from openwhisk-catalog by:\n\n```\nansible-playbook -i environments/local openwhisk.yml -e mode=withoutExtraCatalog or something similar\n```\n\n**If the user starts the installation from openwhisk:** in openwhisk.yml or even postdeploy.yml, check if it is withExtraCatalog. \nIf so, download the openwhisk-catalog repo and put it in the same dir as openwhisk is located, run the install scripts under openwhisk-catalog. \nIf not, skip the catalog installation from openwhisk-catalog.\n\n**If the user starts the installation from openwhisk-catalog:** in the installation script of openwhisk-catalog, check if <openwhisk_home> exists. \nIf so, use this variable and install the catalog packages;\nIf not, download the openwhisk repo and put it in the same dir as openwhisk-catalog, install the openwhisk with the mode of withoutExtraCatalog, so that openwhisk would not check openwhisk-catalog this time. Then install the catalog packages in openwhisk-catalog.\n\nI can come up with some PRs for POCs. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230863447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230863512","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/851#issuecomment-230863512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/851","id":230863512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDg2MzUxMg==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T18:33:53Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T18:33:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"IPG 263.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230863512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/230891358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/797#issuecomment-230891358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/797","id":230891358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDg5MTM1OA==","user":{"login":"mdeuser","id":18535381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM1Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18535381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser","html_url":"https://github.com/mdeuser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdeuser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-06T20:10:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T20:10:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Travis is now happy.

brings up an important point but I think there are actually two issues.  I agree on (2) and in-between on (1).\n1.  Should the action be failed if it exceeds the quota?  I am ambivalent with it failing so the user is alerted in some way.  Alternatives are to consider error codes that signify something unusual has happened but not a failure.  We may need this anyway to alert the user that the action required a retry.\n2. Should the log be truncated if it exceeds the quota?  I would argue no for two reasons.  First, they are allowed to use space up to the quota so why would we impose a severe penalty for going a little over  and not just allow them to have the log up to the quota?  Second, turning the entire log into the string `log limit exceeded` would leave no clues in the log about why the log became so voluminous.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/231179089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/231180203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/853#issuecomment-231180203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/853","id":231180203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTE4MDIwMw==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-07T19:20:32Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T19:20:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"we already have a \"status code\" -
