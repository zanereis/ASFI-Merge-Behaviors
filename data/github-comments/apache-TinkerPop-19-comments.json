bit late to the conversation as I've noticed this hasn't been merged yet.\n\n> I don't think there's a use case in the context of the python GLV, but we have that use case in GraphSON in legacy support for TinkerPop 2.x based GraphSON (the migration scenario mentioned). I don't know that we'd extend that to Python. \n\nConsidering that the GraphSONIO provides both a simpler API and easier integration as noted by @davebshow, plus it doesn't need to account for the legacy support, there are only benefits with this approach.\n\n> I guess the point here is to try to maintain API consistency across all the languages, even if we don't quite have all the support for all the features from Java applicable to Python just yet.\n\nThat's indeed a very good point. Assuming the main users of this API are the GLV implementors, then I'm wondering if making it idiomatic for the target platform shouldn't be the top goal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/253893031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/254515765","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/448#issuecomment-254515765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/448","id":254515765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDUxNTc2NQ==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T13:58:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T13:58:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @al3xandru .... This work has already been merged and will be released in TinkerPop 3.2.3. To answer your concerns though:\n1. In order to make life easier for TinkerPop, its important that we keep the same conventions throughout all the Gremlin language variants. If there is `GraphSONReader/Writer` in Java, `GraphSONIO` in Python, and `GraphSONifier` in JavaScript, it will become increasingly difficult for us to know what does what. Hence, we made a strong stance to say -- \"keep the naming the same.\" With that, I don't see why a `GraphSONIO` utility class couldn't be created that simply references the `GraphSONReader/Writer` methods.\n2. We want idiomatic in some spots and not so in others. Backend utility classes -- non-idomatic (lets do our best to be \"the same\" across all GLVs). Front end user classes --- idiomatic. For example, Gremlin-Ruby would be `g.V().out_e(:knows).weight` ... \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/254515765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/254940482","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/399#issuecomment-254940482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/399","id":254940482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDk0MDQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-19T21:05:00Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T21:05:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this has been merged to master -

added some fixes during the past weeks.\n\nI'll try to summarize the open issues with this patch to try to unblock it:\n\nA) Currently, the javascript GLV exposes `list()` instead of `toList()`. As it takes a callback as a parameter, having the method start with a `toX()` didn't feel natural to me.\nMaybe it makes more sense to follow the existing naming (`toList()`). Exposing something uniform across all GLVs, whenever possible, can be more important (in the same way as Python GLV used mixedCase to be more close to gremlin).\nThe same applies to `next()`. To avoid confusions, we could document that `traversal.next()` is not an iterator and returns the first result.\n\nB) Promise-based API.\nWe can include a promise-based method overloads when supported by the js engine, like [proposed above](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/450#issuecomment-252911095). We can do it now, before merging it or as a next step after merging.\n\nCan we try to reach a conclusion on these issues?\nAfter that I can send a draft documentation for `gremlin-variants.asciidoc`.\n\nI've been using the Javascript GLV for a while now and it feels good to have code completion for Traversal methods on the IDE!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/257310519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/257338997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/456#issuecomment-257338997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/456","id":257338997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzMzODk5Nw==","user":{"login":"pluradj","id":4974160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzQxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4974160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj","html_url":"https://github.com/pluradj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluradj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T16:13:04Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T16:13:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I meant that this pull request #456 can be closed @pauljackson.
