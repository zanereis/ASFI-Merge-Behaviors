What is each data point? Is it individual data point or aggregated? Could you give a more concrete example?\r\n\r\nImagine you want to look at a metric per ZIP code per hour:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(), zipcode, zipcode_geojson\r\nFROM table\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC(time, \"hour\"), zipcode, zipcode_geojson\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though `zipcode` and `zipcode_geoson` are time-independent, they are repeated in the dataset for each hour. The polygons might be complex shapes, so this is a lot of duplicate data.\r\n\r\nInstead, we just pass the ZIP code itself:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(), zipcode\r\nFROM table\r\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC(time, \"hour\"), zipcode\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's still some duplicate data, but now it's 5 bytes per row only.\r\n\r\n> What does `geohash.decode` and `geohash.bbox` do? What is the `code` argument?\r\n\r\nThese are functions from the `geohash` module. The first one decodes a geohash into a lat/lon pair, the second one into a bounding box, IIRC. `code` is the geohash code, something like `9q8yyu`. Let me know if you have suggestions for a better name, it's something that should represent a geohash, a ZIP code, an FSA code.\r\n\r\n> Regarding `viz.py` and embeddable components. Most of the visualization `js` code will be move out of this repo as individual `npm` package plugin. I haven't moved the `deck.gl` directory but could do so after the first round or altogether. Ideally, they should be moved too.
