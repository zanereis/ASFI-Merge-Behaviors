Thanks @revans2 for the great work, and everyone else for the thorough review.\n\nIn terms of back porting this to other branches, I'm okay with that. While the impetus behind this work was the Clojure to Java migration, I think the improvements made here warrant back-porting to earlier version branches. It also doesn't really affect user-facing APIs, so that's not a concern.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/247440588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/247451135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1642#issuecomment-247451135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1642","id":247451135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzQ1MTEzNQ==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T20:48:42Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T20:48:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 Thanks, looks great. +1 for merging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/247451135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/247534676","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1686#issuecomment-247534676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1686","id":247534676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzUzNDY3Ng==","user":{"login":"omkreddy","id":8134545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzQ1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8134545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy","html_url":"https://github.com/omkreddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omkreddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-16T07:19:20Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T07:19:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@satishd pinging for review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/247534676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/247543654","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1417#issuecomment-247543654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1417","id":247543654,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzU0MzY1NA==","user":{"login":"srdo","id":4324588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjQ1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4324588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo","html_url":"https://github.com/srdo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srdo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-16T08:13:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-16T08:13:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@revans2 Any chance I could get you to take a look at this?

When x is ready for retry, retryService.retriableTopicPartitions will return x's TopicPartition, the consumer seeks to x and the consumer is polled. x should then be emitted.

The only thing that bugs me is Storm double acking tuples. The only case I could think of is if tuples time out and they're later acked by the acker bolt, but it seems like the executor actually handles that. As far as I can tell hitting the changed case in findNextCommitOffset should actually indicate a bug in the code, because we've received an ack for a tuple we've already committed to Kafka, which shouldn't be possible unless a tuple is double acked. I don't think that should be happening unless the spout is doing something wrong?\n\n@jfenc91 are you still seeing that case (L498) getting hit even with these changes and the other PR?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/248843503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
