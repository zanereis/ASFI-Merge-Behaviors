thoughts here:\r\n\r\nDo we have to enumerate all the cases in DSL test? I mean `bounded vs bounded`, `unbounded vs unbounded` etc. IMO we don't have to enumerate all the cases, just a happy test is enough, the DSL test is more like an integration test, all the cases should have already been covered by underlying UnitTest. Take JOIN for an example, all the join cases have covered by `BeamJoinRelBoundedVsBoundedTest`, `BeamJoinRelUnboundedVsUnboundedTest`, `BeamJoinRelUnboundedVsBoundedTest`,  we just need to make the JOIN feature integrates well the DSL methods, how do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/313287457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/313287914","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3505#issuecomment-313287914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3505","id":313287914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzI4NzkxNA==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-06T03:49:55Z","updated_at":"2017-07-06T03:49:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"retest this please","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/313287914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/313290377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3330#issuecomment-313290377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3330","id":313290377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMzI5MDM3Nw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-06T04:13:59Z","updated_at":"2017-07-06T04:13:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There is clearly an issue with side inputs and overrides with this PR:\r\n\r\n -
