The compute then transfer over the matrix, and if you enable statistics you can see the internal time use of the rand call, while extrapolating the time of transfer as the unreported time in the statistics.\r\nSimilarly you can read in a Frame in the SDS context and call compute to transfer it to pandas.\r\n\r\nI think this would be to much for this PR, so it can be a subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n> Also, I've noticed that the PRs show as closed instead of merged, is that because of local merging, could you try merging from the github UI for better Github Achievements tracking?\r\n\r\nWe are merging ourselves via rebase ans squash so we circumvent the GitHub UI. This is done for historic reasons, to reduce errors, and to avoid merge commits in the git log. If you want it to be shown as merged then the procedure is also simple. You rebase your commits on top of main, then squash all your commits into a single one. This then is registered as a merge in GitHub when we manually merge it.\r\n\r\nBr \r\nSebastian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1628573442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1629147228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1850#issuecomment-1629147228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1850","id":1629147228,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5hGtBc","user":{"login":"Sheypex","id":6898191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTgxOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6898191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex","html_url":"https://github.com/Sheypex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sheypex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T15:00:22Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T15:00:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok, tested on Java 11.\r\nCan confirm, it was apparently just the Java version.\r\nAlso just adjusted the number of epochs in the MNIST test because it was just taking too long.\r\nMight want to consider reducing the number of epochs from 5 and 50 down to 5 and 25.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1629147228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1629208869","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1850#issuecomment-1629208869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1850","id":1629208869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5hG8El","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T15:35:31Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T15:35:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Glad that worked. \r\nAre both the NN tests working?

 only new shell script, backend uses existing .dml implementations for regression and classification datagen\r\n- for NCF, \r\n    - data is generated as demonstrated in `scripts/nn/examples/ncf-dummy-data.dml`\r\n- and for MNIST (conv2d)\r\n    - added seperate script, that downloads MNIST dataset in .csv format from Github repo and additional scripts to trim this data down into separate datasets given the MAXMEM flag in `runAll.sh`\r\n- Generally:\r\n    - `scripts/datagen` has respective .dml implementations \r\n    - `scripts/perftest/datagen` has .sh implementation parts of this datagen\r\n\r\n#### Perftests\r\n- added perftest scripts for NN regression and classification,\r\n    - NN tests run on a sparse and a dense input dataset\r\n- for NCF,\r\n    - NCF perftest is structurally complete and should work but is untested, as the .dml NCF implementation fails\r\n- and for MNIST (conv2d)\r\n- Generally:\r\n    - These perftests adhere to the common structure of other tests: `scripts/perftest/scripts` houses .dml implementations that are to be tested, `scripts/perftest/run[xyz].sh` implement staging data and collecting timing data of test runs\r\n    - tests run 2 rounds of tests with separate number of training epochs per given dataset\r\n    - tests are split into a training test and a simple prediction test: the prediction test only runs a single prediction to check the accuracy/loss of the trained model\r\n\r\n#### Miscellaneous\r\n- `runAll.sh` now has a flag to enable the use of the GPU for NN, NCF, and MNIST (conv2d) tests and a flag to enable all of these\r\n    - NN tests are currently on by default ie. flag to run them is set in `runAll.sh`, while the use of the GPU is disabled\r\n- NCF test and datagen have been disabled in `runAll.sh`, since .dml NCF implementation fails\r\n- example algorithms in `scirpts/nn/examples/README.md` have been altered to correctly pick and batch training data\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1629268411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/1629782408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1850#issuecomment-1629782408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1850","id":1629782408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc5hJIGI","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T21:53:45Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T21:53:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great.

The approaches of vectorization and sampling were generally good. Just the sampling multiplied the permutation matrix from the right - this selects columns, instead we need to select rows so multiply from the left. I fixed it but it's generally a indicator that this method is not tested yet. But don't worry, I'll take it from here. Furthermore, I simplified the sampling and randomization.
