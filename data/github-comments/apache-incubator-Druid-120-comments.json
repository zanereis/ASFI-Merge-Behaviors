For that, I had to work around the fact that Granularity enum inherently didn't support timezone. Early on, @cheddar suggested to solve this by taking note of how QueryGranularity supports `period`. But we didn't have the time to do this before the first PR. Now, I ended up refactoring by creating a `PeriodSegmentGranularity` and `PeriodQueryGranularity`. Both of them have shared logic about truncation, increments and decrements for a `period` that is encapsulated in `PeriodGranularity`. \r\n\r\nThe last sentence above should also answer your comment on `PeriodGranualrity`\r\n\r\nHope this offers some more context for this PR. If its alright, I can take a stab at unifying into a single concept in the next PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/268398453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/268407917","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3778#issuecomment-268407917","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3778","id":268407917,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODQwNzkxNw==","user":{"login":"KurtYoung","id":955396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTM5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/955396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung","html_url":"https://github.com/KurtYoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KurtYoung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-21T01:21:50Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T01:21:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Don't think so if we need a new \"segmentGranularity\" policy.

The code for mapping a period to granularityType only worked if the period was in one of the pre-defined granularities (the ones from GranularityType). As a result, if we specified a custom period like say PT2S or P2M etc, the constructor would throw an exception b/c it wouldn’t be able to find an appropriate granularityType. The reason the mapping exists is so that we can get the appropriate formatters - hive, default and lowerDefault.\r\n2.

But both batch and real time ingestion are fine with this change. However it breaks SQL support.\r\n\r\n@gianm here's my understanding of this issue.\r\n\r\n1. druid brings calcite-core brings **avatica** 1.8.0, **avatica-server** 1.8.0 brings jackson 2.6.3. \r\n2. druid brings avatica-server brings **avatica-core** 1.9.0 brings jackson 2.6.3.\r\n3. druid brings **avatica-core** 1.9.0 brings jackson 2.6.3.\r\n\r\n**Attempt 1**\r\nI simply tried adding exclusions for jackson to all the above. Still had the ingestion jackson issue.\r\n\r\n**Attempt 2**\r\nI was reading up on avatica and found this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1224\r\nand https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/282\r\n\r\nBasically avatica is a shaded jar and avatica-core is an unshaded jar.\r\n\r\nI thought great, lets have calcite-core use unshaded jar instead. So I excluded the avatica shaded jar from calcite-core itself and had that use avatica-core that came from druid. The exclusions for jackson on avatica-server and avatica-core remained in place from attempt 1.\r\n\r\nThis solved the ingestion jackson issue but breaks calcite b/c calcite-core wants avatica version 1.8.0 but druid brings in avatica-core version 1.9.0. I believe this is a version discrepancy and not an issue with shaded vs unshaded. I am unable to have druid roll back avatica-core to 1.8.0 b/c unshaded avatica-core was only introduced in 1.9.0. \r\n\r\nWhy does druid bring in avatica-server 1.9.0 and avatica-core 1.9.0? I'm asking b/c calcite-core brings in avatica-server 1.8.0 and avatica 1.8.0. If there is no reason,  we can try bringing druid deps on avatica in parity with calcite-core to look like below. \r\n\r\n1. druid brings calcite-core brings **avatica** 1.8.0, **avatica-server** 1.8.0 brings jackson 2.6.3. \r\n2. druid brings avatica-server brings **avatica** 1.8.0 brings jackson 2.6.3.\r\n3. druid brings **avatica** 1.8.0 brings jackson 2.6.3.\r\n\r\nSee 2 and 3. They are different from the ones listed earlier. Then we can try excluding jackson.\r\n\r\nThis PR has the change described in attempt 2. @gianm i'm not very familiar with how these deps are getting used in druid. So pls let me know if you have any thoughts on how to fix this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/269043781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/269045047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3798#issuecomment-269045047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3798","id":269045047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTA0NTA0Nw==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-23T20:59:46Z","updated_at":"2016-12-23T21:03:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Outline of the \"Faster topN query processing\" part:\r\n 1. Add `QueryProcessingHotLoopCallee` marker interface with `inspectRuntimeShape()` method. `inspectRuntimeShape()` is similar to `toString()`, but it focuses on exact classes of the fields for monomorphism and selected aspects for branch predictability, e. g. the fraction of set bits in bitmaps we iterate over. `DimensionSelector`, `ValueMatcher`, `BufferAggregator`, `Float/Long/ObjectColumnSelector`, `IndexedInts`, `Offset` and probably some other interfaces extend `QueryProcessingHotLoopCallee`.\r\n 2. Before making a query, getting the *runtime shape* of the relevant parts e. g. for topN it's offset and aggregators. Make copies of query processing class (e. g. stateless `TopNProcessor`) and cache instances of those copied classes in `ConcurrentMap<RuntimeShape, TopNProcessor> shapeProcessors`. Then query like `shapeProcessors.get(aggregator.inspectRuntimeShape()).process(aggregator, offset, resultsBuffer, ...)`.\r\n 3. Specialize single-value `DimensionSelector`s with method `int getRowValue()`.\r\n 4.
