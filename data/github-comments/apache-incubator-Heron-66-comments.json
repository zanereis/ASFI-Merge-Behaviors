However these operators still has type safety and can be used the same way as other pre-defined operators. Therefore, from API point of view, I don't think it \"bring the streamlet API back to the bolt and spout API.\" Instead, it brings more powers from the bolt and spout API to streamlet.\r\n\r\nBasically Streamlet is a functional API, and function API is overall nice and elegant. However I believe, a functional API is HARDLY a general purpose API and it is only good for \"nice\" problems. It might enforce uses to change the way of thinking and solving problems, which can be good sometimes (use general/standard operations) and bad in other times (more like hacks). Therefore I think supporting custom operator is important for Heron.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the original feature I needed was to reuse existing Bolts and Spouts which has been completed.

The travis folder has a few ci scripts. There differences are:\r\n- the travis job try to build everything and then run integration tests. It is for continuous integration, not for builds. Also in the scripts there are some travis specific code.\r\n- The scripts in this folder are general and can be easily used by different CI engines (like the description in README). It is for release only currently but will have some for testing.\r\n\r\nWe will need to migration the integration tests travis job to jenkins. I am thinking of creating a few new scripts for integration tests.
