The first is to use the built-in C++ operator and the second is to manually broadcast the input using `broadcast_axis` and then use the original add OP. Will the second solution be much slower?

add an extra data point, that I think is very relevant:\n\nI have a smaller version of the same model that works. Here's a line from the model:\n\n```\nflow = mx.sym.Concat(in1, in2, in3, in4, num_args=4)\n```\n\nIf I change this code to:\n\n```\noutputs.append(mx.sym.BlockGrad(in3))\nflow = mx.sym.Concat(in1, in2, in3, in4, num_args=4)\n```\n\nIt starts hitting the same issue as above on the `Concat` op. Note that even though I block the grad, the input to the Concat is NOT the output of BlockGrad. So seems like blocking grads on that particular argument starts breaking stuff. Note that if I change it to (reorder in2 and in3):\n\n```\noutputs.append(mx.sym.BlockGrad(in3))\nflow = mx.sym.Concat(in1, in3, in2, in4, num_args=4)\n```\n\nit still fails, and still with `ord=2`, even though the `in3` is now the second argument (with ordinal=1), so it makes me suspect that ordinal has nothing to do with the order of inputs to the `Concat`.\n\nFinally, if I change it to:\n\n```\noutputs.append(mx.sym.BlockGrad(in2))\nflow = mx.sym.Concat(in1, in3, in2, in4, num_args=4)\n```\n\nThen it does not fail. So it is specific to `in3`. If I block any of `in1`, `in2` and `in4`, it works, but if I block `in3` it breaks. The difference in them that `in1`, `in2` and `in4` come from Embedding and FullyConnected layers, while `in3` comes from a pointwise multiplication of some activations over `SliceChannel` output.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/223383438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/223387715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2317#issuecomment-223387715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2317","id":223387715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzM4NzcxNQ==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T18:55:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T18:55:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@tqchen Any ideas?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/223387715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/223392865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2317#issuecomment-223392865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2317","id":223392865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzM5Mjg2NQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T19:14:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T19:14:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The last time this happens.
