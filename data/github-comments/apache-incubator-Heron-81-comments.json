I was not familiar with the `zip` method, but it seems to be a [standard pattern](https://realpython.com/python-zip-function/#passing-n-arguments). When I print the value returned from that call I can see the value. It's only when that same result is returned from the `compute_max` that I get an empty `{}` in the `data` variable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094096215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094100307","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3786#issuecomment-1094100307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3786","id":1094100307,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps5BNqVT","user":{"login":"surahman","id":3979925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman","html_url":"https://github.com/surahman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-09T18:18:03Z","updated_at":"2022-04-10T02:29:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I think `zip()` returns an `Iterator` and the `list()` call converts to an actual List.\r\n\r\nI believe `dict` might have a constructor to handle `zip` return values as seen [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#func-dict).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094100307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094375901","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3786#issuecomment-1094375901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3786","id":1094375901,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps5BOtnd","user":{"login":"Code0x58","id":9309570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDk1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9309570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58","html_url":"https://github.com/Code0x58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-10T21:41:43Z","updated_at":"2022-04-10T21:41:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> I can't figure out why the timeline is not working. I've tracked my issue to this [line of code](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/06e9f75988fd254053b640689879c3393703b0dd/heron/tools/common/src/python/clients/tracker.py#L575). Within the `compute_max` function, I can print the final `dict` that is returned. It has values. But when I print `data`, it only has an empty `dict`.\r\n\r\nDid you do that print within the `len(filtered_ts) > 0 and len(filtered_ts[0][\"timeline\"]) > 0:` branch of `compute_max(...)`? I'm wondering if the `{}` you are seeing is from the fall-though branch.\r\n\r\nBeware that `timelines` and `values` in `compute_max(...)` are generators, so will be exhausted if you do something with them before they are used in the `return dict(list(zip(keys, values)))`, so if you did `print(dict(list(zip(keys, values))))` it would consume `values` and lead to zip of the keys list and an empty generator which results in an empty zip (python 3.10 adds [`strict=True`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) to help detect these) and would so make the `return dict(...)` line return an empty dict.\r\n\r\n_p.s._\r\n> I am not sure but I do not think there is a need to convert the zipped together values into a `list` and then a `dict`. But then I also do not believe this would affect the return value.\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/06e9f75988fd254053b640689879c3393703b0dd/heron/tools/common/src/python/clients/tracker.py#L626\r\n> \r\n> Maybe try this:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> return dict(zip(keys, values))\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nboth are equivalent and will be handled the same way due to python's duck typing, as both a generator (returned by zip, in type annotations it is compatible with [`typing.Iterator`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Iterator) but is more strictly a [`typing.Generator`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generator)) and list will be treated as iterables. The use of `list(generator)` can be faster for some cases, but constructs an object which will be discarded so can be a waste of memory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094375901/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094412215","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3786#issuecomment-1094412215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3786","id":1094412215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps5BO2e3","user":{"login":"surahman","id":3979925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman","html_url":"https://github.com/surahman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-10T23:47:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-10T23:47:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for the detailed explanation!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094412215/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/1094432040","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3786#issuecomment-1094432040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3786","id":1094432040,"node_id":"IC_kwDOApKMps5BO7Uo","user":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T00:50:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T01:03:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this PR is finally done.

I ask because there were various issues with the intermingling of the types.

I'll have to dig into it further. I'll have to make it fail the way it did in TravicCI, and then fix the logic. Hopefully just a simple environment issue on my end.\r\n\r\nLooking in each Uploader, they seem to have logic for uploading a package with the same name. But this logic would never be needed if the intention was to always generate a unique filename. I really think this is a relic from the old Twitter code base. It doesn't seem to provide any value. \r\n\r\nBut it does cause a storage leak in the Bookkeeper and Zookeeper. It is not as big a deal in Zookeeper, but we have definitely seen Bookkeeper fill up with all of the old artifacts. Especially when on a developer cluster where the same analytic job might be resubmitted multiple times through the development process.\r\n\r\nEdit: I figured out my issue.
