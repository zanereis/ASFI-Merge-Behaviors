I will remove the scripts and configuration (flux and properties) files and remove the error indexing topology from the MPack.  If a user wants to use a separate error indexing topology it will be their responsibility to change error topic setting and start a separate indexing topology.  Does this sound ok to everyone?\r\n\r\nA couple questions are still unanswered.  How granular should the error topic setting be?  I will assume global config is acceptable unless I hear otherwise.  Also, as @cestella alluded to earlier, what should the structure of the source.type field be?  I see these as possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. source.type is 'error' with sensor name and error type in separate fields (1 index config)\r\n2. source.type is error type with sensor name in separate field (index config per error type)\r\n3. source.type is sensor name + '_error' (additional error index config per sensor)\r\n\r\nIf no one has any strong opinions I will stick with option 1.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281515101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281522068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/450#issuecomment-281522068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/450","id":281522068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTUyMjA2OA==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-21T23:56:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T23:56:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, good catch, I've made the functionality and some of the doc changes requested @nickwallen and I'll finish the rest in the morning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281522068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281544793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/450#issuecomment-281544793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/450","id":281544793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTU0NDc5Mw==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T02:02:34Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T02:02:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Ok @nickwallen I think I have adjusted the docs and functionality sufficiently well that I have addressed your issues.

If the current issue is with the Solr Indexer, then we should fix that to flatten any data that it needs to.

My issues with it are:\r\n* You seem to be sending every profile into kafka, not just the configured ones.\r\n* You seem to be assuming that one value only is being sent into the telemetry and it's the value that you store in HBase\r\n\r\nI'd recommend, rather, that you make the `result` field more complex by making it a map where the key is the source (e.g. \"hbase\" or \"kafka\").  This allows you to separate the storage structure by storage medium.  You may, for instance, want to *STORE* a stats object in Hbase, but only send along the mean and standard deviation.  Also, I'd recommend allowing `result`to be either a string (which would presume only hbase is supported) or a Map, which would explicitly specify the structure for just the sources you want to write to.\r\n\r\nHere's a worked example config for maximum clarity (!):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"test\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'squid'\",\r\n      \"init\":    { \"stats\": \"STATS_INIT()\" },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"stats\": \"STATS_ADD(stats, LENGTH(url))\" },\r\n      \"result\":  {\r\n         \"hbase\" : \"stats\",\r\n         \"kafka\" : [ \"{ 'mean' : STATS_MEAN(stats), 'stddev' : STATS_SD(stats) }\", \"STATS_KURTOSIS(stats)\" ]\r\n       }\r\n      \r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNINJA EDIT: Also, you might consider making the values for result be a list, so more than one value can be written per message.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281736728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281738379","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/449#issuecomment-281738379","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/449","id":281738379,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTczODM3OQ==","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T17:21:46Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T17:21:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also,

You seem to be sending every profile into kafka, not just the configured ones\r\n\r\nJust for clarity, you can define the destination for each profile.  It defaults to a `\"destination\" : [\"hbase\", \"kafka\"]`.

He thought it was a replacement for HBase, rather than an addition to that.  His mistake was totally understandable.  Using terms like 'kafka' and 'hbase', forces the user to under why they would want to send profile data to HBase and why they would want to send profile data to Kafka.  It forces the user to know the implementation.\r\n\r\nBut I am saying that users should not need to know the implementation details of the Profiler.  They should just tell us if they want the profile data stored for later and whether they want to triage the data from the Profiler.\r\n\r\nSo I am suggesting that to be \"user focused\" we use terms that focus on the functionality from the user's perspective, not terms based on how we've implemented the Profiler.  A user would tell us to 'triage' or not; they would not tell us 'kafka' or not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281781781/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281786728","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/462#issuecomment-281786728","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/462","id":281786728,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTc4NjcyOA==","user":{"login":"kylerichardson","id":10392029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkyMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10392029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson","html_url":"https://github.com/kylerichardson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T20:05:25Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T20:05:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 builds and all tests passing.

I think we had different interpretations of \"user focused.\"\r\n\r\nI think where I landed here on what I'd like can be broken down into a near-term, medium-term and a long-term vision for the profiler.\r\n\r\n**Near Term**\r\nIn the near term, for this PR, we need the ability to:\r\n* Write from the profiler to kafka so we can triage the output of the profiler\r\n* Adjust the representations of the data the profiler writes based on the places it writes to\r\n  * For HBase, any kryo serialized object\r\n  * For Kafka, any fundamental structure (e.g. number, string) or Map of fundamental structures.\r\n* Be backwards compatible with the current syntax.\r\n* Ninja Edit: I think the kafka topic written to should be pulled from zookeeper and I think the default should be the enrichments topic, not spin up a separate parser.  I don't think it's giving us anything, it ends up in enrichment anyway and I think it's yet another topology.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, I'll adopt your approach here of separating representation by its destination, where that destination is restricted to the possible destinations inside of Metron's current architecture.  So called *destination-focused*, rather than separating representation by its storage mechanism, where those storage mechanisms are restricted to the possible mechanisms that we support in Metron.  So called *writer-focused*\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, every tick, the following happens:\r\n* 1 message is written to HBase with the stats function\r\n* 1 message is written to Kafka with a message that looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'profile' : 'test',\r\n  'entity' : 'global'\r\n  'mean' : ####,\r\n  'stddev' : ####\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks like: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"test\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'squid'\",\r\n      \"update\":  { \"stats\": \"STATS_ADD(stats, LENGTH(url))\" },\r\n      \"result\":  {\r\n         \"profile\" : \"stats\",\r\n         \"triage\" : \"{ 'mean' : STATS_MEAN(stats), 'stddev' : STATS_SD(stats) }\"\r\n       }     \r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Medium Term**\r\n\r\nThis gets expanded to allow for multiple elements written per profile.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, every tick, the following happens:\r\n* 2 message is written to HBase for profile `test`\r\n  * entity: `global:stats`\r\n  * entity: `global:count`\r\n* 2 message is written to Kafka with a message that looks like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'profile' : 'test',\r\n  'entity' : 'global'\r\n  'result_type' : 'baseline_stats'\r\n  'mean' : ####,\r\n  'stddev' : ####\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'profile' : 'test',\r\n  'entity' : 'global'\r\n  'result_type' : 'kurtosis'\r\n  'kurtosis' : ####\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"test\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'squid'\",\r\n      \"update\":  { \"stats\": \"STATS_ADD(stats, LENGTH(url))\" },\r\n      \"result\":  {\r\n         \"profile\" : {\r\n                      \"stats\" :  \"stats\",\r\n                      \"count\" : \"STATS_COUNT(stats)\"\r\n         \"triage\" : {\r\n                      \"baseline_stats\" : \"{ 'mean' : STATS_MEAN(stats), 'stddev' : STATS_SD(stats) }\",\r\n                      \"kurtosis\" : \"STATS_KURTOSIS(stats)\"\r\n                       }\r\n                   }   \r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Longer Term**\r\n\r\nThis is where, in my mind, the writer-focused morphs into 'writer configuration' focused, which is to say, not just the transport, but also the destination.  In this world, we can directly associate the representation of the things we're writing from the profiler with the destination.  Our point of configuration for new writers in Metron is the `MessageWriter` and `BulkMessageWriter` interfaces.  We recently pulled out the configs into their own indexing configs, keyed by writer (kafka, elasticsearch, etc).  Imagine that the writers are configured entirely there and that it's not writer-oriented, but use-case oriented.  Instead of what we have now in the indexing config, we can make it:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"writers\" : {\r\n     \"kafka\" : {\r\n      \"batchSize\" : 1,\r\n      \"enabled\" : true\r\n     },\r\n   \"hbase_profile\" : {\r\n      \"batchSize\" : 5,\r\n      \"enabled\" : true\r\n   }\r\n   },\r\n  \"endpoints\" : {\r\n     \"triage\" : {\r\n         \"writer\" : \"kafka\",\r\n         \"queue\" : \"enrichments\"\r\n                     },\r\n      \"profile\" : {\r\n         \"writer\" : \"hbase_profile\",\r\n         \"table\" : \"profile:P\"\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhere, the two forms merge into one because we can represent using our core abstractions the capability-driven design that you are focused on, @nickwallen .  In this world, the profiler is simple, it just writes messages out to the indexing topology.  The structure looks of the tuple looks like:\r\n* message\r\n* endpoint\r\n\r\nThe indexing topology will use the source type to pull the config and, since the endpoint is specified in the tuple, it will use the endpoint to write the message to the appropriately configured destination.\r\n\r\nIn this world, the example in the medium term does not change:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"test\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'squid'\",\r\n      \"update\":  { \"stats\": \"STATS_ADD(stats, LENGTH(url))\" },\r\n      \"result\":  {\r\n         \"profile\" : {\r\n                      \"stats\" :  \"stats\",\r\n                      \"count\" : \"STATS_COUNT(stats)\"\r\n         \"triage\" : {\r\n                      \"baseline_stats\" : \"{ 'mean' : STATS_MEAN(stats), 'stddev' : STATS_SD(stats) }\",\r\n                      \"kurtosis\" : \"STATS_KURTOSIS(stats)\"\r\n                       }\r\n                   }   \r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`profile` and `triage` are interpreted to mean endpoint names, who can be looked up in the indexing configuration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281806274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281808270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/449#issuecomment-281808270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/449","id":281808270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTgwODI3MA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T21:22:58Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T21:22:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think routing from stellar within routing in storm is confusing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281808270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/281833038","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/449#issuecomment-281833038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/449","id":281833038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTgzMzAzOA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T22:57:57Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T22:57:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@nickwallen I agree with you about exposing implementation details via our API.
