It's commonly used, but the problem is it isn't available in `PATH` or anything - it's installed in the user's dir normally. There's no good way to detect its presence while building Thrift.\r\n\r\nWhat if we included the Quicklisp installer (literally a single `.lisp` file), installed it locally during the build, and then used it to pull in other dependencies?

Most of them outside the code I touched on this feature.\r\n\r\nIf now, suddenly, there's a requirement to write code with C90 style we have a problem because generators are not ready. In fact I had to disable parts of the compilation stuff to check where the problem were because the generated code is invalid in C90 style. \r\n\r\nI think the build system has to be updated or the rules to write code to be updated. So please if this fails again, I will let you correct because you know a lot more about the build system than I do. \r\n\r\nThank you for your support. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/343796961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/comments/343810061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1361#issuecomment-343810061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/1361","id":343810061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzgxMDA2MQ==","user":{"login":"jeking3","id":11771245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcxMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11771245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3","html_url":"https://github.com/jeking3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeking3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-13T04:35:59Z","updated_at":"2017-11-13T04:35:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Try \"dockerbuild ubuntu-xenial\" then \"dockerrun ubuntu-xenial\", then \"build/docker/scripts/autotools.sh\" inside the docker environment as that is how travis runs, you will have the exact same build.

Please review and merge. It seems it has a lot of different compilation flags, depending what's compiling. We should fix the build and agree what flags should go in the compilation. Because it's very difficult to work that way. I build, everything seems ok. And then on 1 of the tests of travis one flag is added and all compilation is broken. We must add the same exact flags to all compilations. \r\n\r\nI discovered investigating that at least this flags should be added (or removed) from all compilations. \r\n\r\nCFLAGS=\"-std=c90 -Wformat -Werror=format-security -O2 -fstack-protector-strong -Wall -Wextra -pedantic\" \r\n\r\nIn fact I don't understand why they are added.
