It might be better to use that so they know the tests have been explicitly skipped whereas other issues might cause 0 tests to be run (e.g. some code might cause an early return). It also allows us to give a reason for skipping a test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/451774666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/451776424","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2237#issuecomment-451776424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2237","id":451776424,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTc3NjQyNA==","user":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-06T21:27:23Z","updated_at":"2019-01-06T21:27:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@reminisce for now we only support closed term, but we are moving to there.\r\nwdym by imperative programming?

It shouldn't be hard if you only want to offload most of ops to VTA and only keep a few to CPU. Otherwise, I think it might be a little tedious to traverse the program and add `on_device` ops. Another way might make annotation easier is probably to allow users to just provide relay op names instead of adding `on_device` primitives directly, and we can add these primitives in the backend.

I'm making minimum assumptions like even removing the debugging for `TVMValue` and including it raw same as in Rust runtime. The only idea that might lead to a solution is to include the entire `c_runtime_api.rs` in common and get rid of my `tvm-sys` which I don't like and it would impose very uncommon layout for a Rust binding. If I include some partial C runtime api such as `TVMValue` and `TVMTypeCode`, then Rust's orphan rule prevents me from conversion from `common::TVMValue` to `tvm_sys::TVMValue` and need to change all occurences of `tvm_sys::TVMValue` in the raw api to `common::TVMValue` which is not possible!\r\n\r\nI'm now thinking maybe common crate is not a good idea here and we can have exactly the same functionalities with two different implementations because runtime and frontend needs are different when we include debugging for example. Note that this includes very basic value conversions API only and it's not significant.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'll work on making a common crate this week and next maybe and if I wouldn't have found a solution by then, I'd just change the frontend `TVMRetValue` to exactly match the runtime and impl the same conversions and send the PR. \r\n\r\nAny
