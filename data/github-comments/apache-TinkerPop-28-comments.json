I recently [added partial JavaScript-GLV support to gremlin-javascript](https://github.com/jbmusso/gremlin-javascript/tree/3bdb154f41c08d5adfc65e83250eee6d57a5cab5#experimental-javascript-gremlin-language-variant). The library generates Groovy strings using [zer](https://github.com/jbmusso/zer) which is now stable/tested enough that I decided to add it as a dependency to the client. I'll soon tinker with gremlin bytecode support in zer and I think support for lambdas is easy with `Function.prototype.toString()` (ref: [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString)).\r\n\r\nWe could maybe add Babel dependency with nashorn/ES5 presets, then parse/transpile lambdas at runtime so people can use ES2015/2016+ lambdas in their Node.js/browsers environments (though transpilation performance could be an issue, but client-side caching/memoization could certainly help).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/305914911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/306134566","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/450#issuecomment-306134566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/450","id":306134566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjEzNDU2Ng==","user":{"login":"jorgebay","id":2931196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzExOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2931196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay","html_url":"https://github.com/jorgebay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorgebay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T08:38:45Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T08:38:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great!

Generally speaking the `Channelizer` isn't responsible for many of the features under test in `GremlinServerIntegrateTest` and there are other tests that are probably testing `Channelizer` capabilities that aren't represented there (maybe more true on master than tp32 - you might need a second PR when we sort this one out).\r\n\r\nI think it would be worth identifying the tests that validate that a `Channelizer` is doing its job right and make a common set of tests that are executed over different server configurations. This would probably mean cherry picking tests from existing ones and moving them to this new test class.  \r\n\r\nFor example, `shouldBatchResultsByTwos` has nothing to do with the `Channelizer` selection really. That's an integration test for the `OpProcessor` really. On a similar note, `shouldReceiveFailureTimeOutOnScriptEval` is a integration test of the `GremlinExecutor` - such a test would not need to be executed across multiple configurations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `shouldStartWithDefaultSettings` is quite generic and would be a good general smoke test. That one could be cherry picked to the new common test class and renamed to \"shouldReturnListOfNumbers\".  We'd probably also want to know if SSL/authentication can be enabled across all `Channelizer` implementations - that's a common feature and one controlled by the `Channelizer`.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense to you at all?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/310496196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/310526580","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/632#issuecomment-310526580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/632","id":310526580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDUyNjU4MA==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-22T23:07:56Z","updated_at":"2017-06-22T23:07:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sheldonkhall  I just wanted to quickly poke in here and thank you for submitting this - @okram is probably the best person to review this and he hasn't been feeling well.
