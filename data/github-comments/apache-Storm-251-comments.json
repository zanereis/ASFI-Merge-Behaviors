If it is all in then we probably need some better documentation on how to set it up and use it properly.\n\n@danny0405 not having HA is not acceptable. I agree.  The code is written so that if you have more than one pacemaker server the workers will load balance the heartbeats between them, but if one of them goes down the worker will fail over to one of the existing servers.  Nimbus then will read from all of the pacemaker servers and if there are more than one heartbeat for a given worker the one with the newest timestamp wins.  You should be able to get HA just by having more than one of them, but I want to be sure that everything for that including bug fixes have been merged into open source.  They should be, but if you are having issues I want to be sure.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/242389993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612696899","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5281#issuecomment-2612696899","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5281","id":2612696899,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI2OTY4OTk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T14:27:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T14:42:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a

Each commit is a logical groping. One is docs, one is the default values, and one is the logging changes. They all have the same JIRA ticket, but the commit log messages suit the changes. The reason behind this choice is that it is easier to cherry pick only part of the changes to a given branch - if needed. I also believe that it makes it easier for an external person to follow what each patch addresses.\n\nI am OK with either approach. This squash is pretty simple.

@srdo,\n\nGreat catch and thanks for the contribution.\nBtw, as we're continuously suffering race conditions in supervisor, @revans2 proposed new supervisor design and submitted pull request -

to V2 in near future. For now #1642 is for master, but since we found race even 1.0.2 again, I think we should port back to 1.x and 1.0.x and release.\n\nCould you help to review #1642 if you don't mind?
