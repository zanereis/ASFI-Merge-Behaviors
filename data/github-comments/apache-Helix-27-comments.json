@junkaixue, thanks for the question. \r\n\r\nTwo acute problems motivate upgrading the web app `helix-front` to the latest version of the Angular UI framework (Angular 13 at this writing).\r\n\r\n1) node-sass dependency doesn't support M1 MacBooks.\r\n\r\n2) Several other dependencies have security vulnerabilities that we are unable to fix without a holistic upgrade, since often the new major version of the insecure dependency that fixes the security vulnerability requires us to upgrade to a corresponding new major version of another old-but-apparently-secure dependency.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> Notes: Vulnerability found: ansi-regex is vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity remediation: Upgrade ansi-regex from 4.1.1 to 5.0.1 to fix the vulnerability.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther developer ergonomics issues also motivate the upgrade: \r\n\r\n- helix-front will not build with current nodejs or npm. \r\n- helix-front may not build with the yarn package manager.\r\n- helix-front builds very slowly since, it requires the developer to compile the old node-sass. This compilation often fails, for difficult to debug reasons.\r\n- helix-front --> node-sass --> node-gyp as-is requires Python 2, which is unsupported in many places.
