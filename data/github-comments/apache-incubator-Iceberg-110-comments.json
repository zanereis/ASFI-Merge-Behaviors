@stevenzwu , I have also considered using flink's watermark to design iceberg's data advancement information, but why I rejected it later, mainly the following points: \r\n\r\n1. what is flink watermark: Flink watermark is mainly used to solve the out-of-order problem of delayed data arrival, out-of-order data is very common in real-time streams, and reordering is necessary.\r\n2. what is iceberg watermark: In iceberg, watermark is used when writing data, save the time progress of writing data, it has nothing to do with the reordering of out-of-order data. It is different from the design intention of flink watermark.\r\n\r\nSo, Although we can use the ability of flink watermark to implement iceberg watermark, but if we need to support the reordering of out-of-order data in iceberg in the future, flink iceberg and iceberg watermark will cause confusion.\r\n\r\nSo, For the expression of [watermark] in iceberg watermark, I am also suspicious, It might be called data advancement better？","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/916904105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/916992895","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2847#issuecomment-916992895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2847","id":916992895,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842qDN_","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-10T15:30:04Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T15:30:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mechgouki, that sounds like reasonable motivation to go with the EMC client to me.

I started working on a POC for Peter's option: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3099  \r\n\r\nI also see many advantages of using Hive's native [RetryingMetaStoreClient](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/standalone-metastore/metastore-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/RetryingMetaStoreClient.java).  To repeat some of his and also add some of my own:\r\n\r\n* RetryingMetaStoreClient is used today in Hive and Spark, and is more mature with all known Hive failure types. HiveClientPool will have to catch up to all the Hive exception types to retry: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2844 for some missing exceptions, for example.\r\n* RetryingMetaStoreClient handles UGI impersonation logic for reconnect (needed in Kerberized environments)\r\n* ClientPoolImpl does not support any configuration of retry and retry-backoff. It hard-codes to 1 retry and no backoff, which may not be ideal in all cases (the default in RetryingMetaStoreClient is 3 retries and 1s backoff for instance).\r\n* For user experience, using RetryingMetaStoreClient would unify all Hive configs.  For instance in Spark, setting 'spark.hadoop.hive.metastore.client.connect.retry.delay' will set it for all Hive connections (for Iceberg and non-Iceberg tables).  Whereas if we add configs to ClientPool, it will be per catalog level, which may not make sense to user, and the config flags will be different than what they are used to.\r\n\r\n@rdblue  can you see if these justifications make sense, or if you guys still feel strongly about adding more logic in ClientPool instead?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/917078226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/917117088","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/3097#issuecomment-917117088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/3097","id":917117088,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX842qhig","user":{"login":"itachi-sharingan","id":16745229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16745229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan","html_url":"https://github.com/itachi-sharingan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itachi-sharingan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-10T18:24:07Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T18:24:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Have

Based on the conversation, I try to first introduce the builder for update only. To indicate the builder is for update only, I used name `TableMetadataUpdateBuilder` instead of `TableMetadataBuilder`.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about using the same builder for both update and new metadata, but there might be some unnecessary complications to mix those 2 together, because we need to set defaults for any null values when building new metadata, whereas we want to inherit whatever was in the base metadata without any defaults in an update. So my current stance is that we can introduce another builder later for new table metadata (when that is necessary), and evaluate if it is worth letting them sharing some common class or not.\r\n\r\nFor the feature of accumulating states, I am leaving it out of this PR for now. I tried to implement it, but in update builder we need to recreate a list anyway for whatever we need to overwrite from the old metadata, so the benefit for building the list inside of builder is not obvious compared to building it outside and then overwrite the whole list.
