Can we have multiple affinity keys defined for a table/Cache\r\n\r\nSimple answer: no, don't do that.\r\n\r\nDetails: affinity key is defined per type. Multiple types can be stored in one cache. Multiple SQL tables can be defined in one cache. I would not recommend any of that, keep it 1 cache = 1 table = 1 type.\r\n\r\n> 2. Is there any way to set the affinity key when we have any hierarchy such as Parent -> Child -> Child2\r\n\r\nAll children (direct and indirect) should use the same affinity key as the parent, so that the entire family is colocated. Example: https://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/data-modeling/affinity-collocation#configuring-affinity-key\r\n\r\n> 3. when an Affinity key is defined using DDL statement, Is it possible to update it later using Alter statements or any other approach?\r\n\r\nAFAIK, no\r\n\r\n> 4. How to enable non-colocated joins or distributed joins?\r\n\r\nhttps://ignite.apache.org/docs/latest/SQL/distributed-joins\r\n\r\n> 5. Is it required to have affinity key defined on data Insert as we might have different schemas and affinity keys can vary?\r\n\r\nYes. Ignite uses the affinity key to calculate the target partition. You can't change this for the given row after insert.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2432637544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2433349926","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/11613#issuecomment-2433349926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/11613","id":2433349926,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs6RCfkm","user":{"login":"nizhikov","id":880793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/880793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov","html_url":"https://github.com/nizhikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nizhikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-23T20:14:51Z","updated_at":"2024-10-23T20:14:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ivandasch Thanks for the review!

Arnout Engelen,\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNow it does the build.\r\n\r\nI think we still need to return back the fetch of the PR's base branch (which is master in fact) from the upstream (main ignite) repo. Otherwise the Sonar would fail to detect the \"new lines of code\" if  fork's master is not synchronized with main repo.\r\n\r\nSee details at  https://community.sonarsource.com/t/how-to-use-sonarcloud-with-a-forked-repository-on-github/7363/32\r\n\r\nDo you see any security risks in fetching of the master branch from the main ignite repo?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI mean the following section\r\n```\r\n      - name: Checkout PR base branch\r\n        run: |\r\n          git remote add upstream ${{ github.event.repository.clone_url }}\r\n          git fetch upstream\r\n          git checkout -B $pr_base_ref upstream/$pr_base_ref\r\n          git checkout ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}\r\n          git clean -ffdx && git reset --hard HEAD\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2530220260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/comments/2530468188","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/ignite/pull/11721#issuecomment-2530468188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ignite/issues/11721","id":2530468188,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdkdzs6W0-Fc","user":{"login":"raboof","id":131856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof","html_url":"https://github.com/raboof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-10T05:41:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T05:41:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that should be OK, as we trust `$pr_base_ref` (because it should have been reviewed).
