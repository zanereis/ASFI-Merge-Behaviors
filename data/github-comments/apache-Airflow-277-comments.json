This feels like a bug in mypy rather than a bug in our code.\r\n\r\nThat used to be much slower in python2, but in python3 it's just a bit slower as keys() does not return list of keys (as it used to be) but DictKeyView() (which is backed by the original dict and is updated as the dict updates). See for example here (I repeated those benchmarks with similar results): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10205969/why-in-operator-with-tuple-as-a-key-in-python-so-slow. And the overhead is not proportional to the size of the dict - it's more to construct the dynamic ListView. And \"in\" operator is equally fast - doint hash lookup() rather than linear search as it used to be in Python2.\r\n\r\nThis change was more of my process of adding types - I wanted to understand all the types and make sure they are correct, so I can revert it.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/560017256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/560017527","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6596#issuecomment-560017527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6596","id":560017527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDAxNzUyNw==","user":{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-30T20:15:53Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T20:16:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Thank you very much - I ask because I've used git bisect a couple of times over the last few weeks on Airflow to track down bugs already :)\r\n\r\nBeen there, done that.
