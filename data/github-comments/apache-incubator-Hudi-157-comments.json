@ZeMirella so basically it's about bulk insert a chunk of data. Was `bulk_insert_shuffle_parallelism` set to 2000 in this case? given the data size, you may want to try partitioning the output dataset. Say you choose a field `foo` from the schema as the partition field, and roughly it gives 200 partitions. A few configs you may try changing accordingly\r\n- hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism = 200\r\n- hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable = true // why disabled it explicitly?\r\n- Use a proper class for hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class and hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.partition_extractor_class. It should fit the partitioning strategy you chose. Check out [this blog](https://hudi.incubator.apache.org/blog/2021/02/13/hudi-key-generators/).\r\n- the code for spark write should be sth like\r\n  ```python\r\n  spark_df.repartition(200, spark_df.col(\"foo\")).write.format(\"hudi\").options(**hudi_options).mode(\"overwrite\").partitionBy(\"foo\").save(self.table_path)\r\n  ```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927230026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927234056","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3617#issuecomment-927234056","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3617","id":927234056,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43RHgI","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T05:18:42Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T05:18:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@novakov-alexey the problem is caused by 20210907094837.commit having `\"schema\" : null`. Schema reader is reading from commit file. when it's null it's gonna look for basefile (parquet) to get the schema. But in this case your data is empty. \r\n\r\nI think this is current behavior when data is empty, commit metadata are all null or empty. You could try manually set a json serialized schema string to the commit file. Something like this\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"extraMetadata\" : {\r\n    \"schema\" : \"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"record\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"FullName\\\",\\\"fields\\\": []}\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I do think it makes sense to make the schema available in commit file even when it's empty data. We may make a fix for this. Meanwhile, let us know if manually setting the schema string works for you.\r\n\r\nBTW you don't need to set       \"hoodie.consistency.check.enabled\" -> \"true\", as S3 has become strongly consistent some time back.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927234056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927240469","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3717#issuecomment-927240469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3717","id":927240469,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43RJEV","user":{"login":"hudi-bot","id":79415918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDE1OTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79415918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/hudi-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudi-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T06:06:19Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T06:50:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\nMeta data\n{\n  \"version\" : 1,\n  \"metaDataEntries\" : [ {\n    \"hash\" : \"d74846a834baee91fe8051011e28bb16c1ca299b\",\n    \"status\" : \"SUCCESS\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2398\",\n    \"triggerID\" : \"d74846a834baee91fe8051011e28bb16c1ca299b\",\n    \"triggerType\" : \"PUSH\"\n  } ]\n}-->\n## CI report:\n\n* d74846a834baee91fe8051011e28bb16c1ca299b Azure: [SUCCESS](https://dev.azure.com/apache-hudi-ci-org/785b6ef4-2f42-4a89-8f0e-5f0d7039a0cc/_build/results?buildId=2398) \n\n<details>\n<summary>Bot commands</summary>\n  @hudi-bot supports the following commands:\n\n - `@hudi-bot run travis` re-run the last Travis build\n - `@hudi-bot run azure` re-run the last Azure build\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927240469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927248813","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3697#issuecomment-927248813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3697","id":927248813,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43RLGt","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-26T07:19:17Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T07:19:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Rap70r From the parameters you show, i see the problem is mostly caused by not utilizing the machines' resources efficiently.

Let's discuss some points.\r\n\r\n> i see the point here is to allow PR reviewer easily identify dep changes.\r\n\r\nYes, that's one of the purposes. Another one is to let the contributors or developers/users have a way to know and view the dependencies of those bundles if that way(meet conflict problems). So I output them into the codebase. Just like the Kyuubi has [done.](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kyuubi/pull/1162/files) \r\n\r\n> it turns out to have quite some logic and not friendly to maintainers who are not familiar with bash\r\n\r\nIMO, It's a tool just like other tools in the codebase. We do not need to spend much time to change or maintain it. And we can add more comments and a better usage guide. It's the first version in order to receive other inputs from you guys.\r\n\r\n> why dependency:build-classpath not dependency:tree?\r\n\r\nBecause it's easier and more readable. \r\n\r\n`build-classpath` looks like `ls` behavior and flatted to a dependencies list. However, `tree` contains nested `| \\ + -` right? It's harder to deal with.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927459881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927503142","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3605#issuecomment-927503142","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3605","id":927503142,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43SJMm","user":{"login":"Ambarish-Giri","id":85560823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTYwODIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85560823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri","html_url":"https://github.com/Ambarish-Giri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ambarish-Giri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T03:43:49Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T03:43:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @nsivabalan let me know in case you need any further details?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927503142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/927513816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3676#issuecomment-927513816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3676","id":927513816,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43SLzY","user":{"login":"zhihuihong","id":58018688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDE4Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58018688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhihuihong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhihuihong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T04:12:26Z","updated_at":"2021-09-27T04:13:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"have you tried using clustering after inserting data?\r\nmy job created many  7mb files as well, and i used clustering to reorganize data layout.

base file(file1) which contains two record:  key1, p1\r\n                                                                                                               key2, p2\r\nthen we update key2,  the log file(logfile1) produced and contains record: key2, p3\r\nwhen hive/presto query the table:   file1 has been split into two file parts, one is file1_part1, which contains all the record; the other is file2_part2 wich contains no record.       notice those two file parts  will be bound to logfile1 and produce two realtimesplit。  then the log file will be read twice， repeat result produced。\r\nThe above is a very simple example， in fact query engine split one parquet file into small parts is very common。\r\n\r\n

I just tried but failed again :( Sincerely ask :\r\n> \r\n> 1. What's the version of pesto you used?\r\n> 2. `in docker setup with metadata enabled` => how did you enable metadata table on presto side? I have to modify presto source code to enable presto query using metadata table.\r\n> 3. Did you just put hudi-presto-bundle into hive-hadoop plugin or did some changing in presto-source pom?\r\n> \r\n> Looking forward to your replay. Thanks a lot!\r\n\r\n1. Docker uses Presto 0.217. But I also built the latest Presto snapshot and tested. However, from Hudi perspective, there should be no change since the Presto version 0.240.\r\n2. I enabled metadata in Hudi, not Presto. Hudi metadata tabled was not synced to Hive.\r\n3. No I did not have to place the bundle or change presto pom. Since Presto 0.240, Hudi is a compile-time dependency already.\r\n\r\nAre you able to query normal Hudi data tables using Presto? Are you getting the NoClassDefFoundError only when you query Hudi metadata table? Asking because I did not enable metadata on Presto side. That will require code changes in Presto. Also, youwill need to add hudi-common dependency in Presto pom for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/929111244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/929234706","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3726#issuecomment-929234706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3726","id":929234706,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43Yv8S","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T13:50:58Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T13:50:58Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Readme is common for all PRS right.

Thank you for your response! I had no idea Hudi provides event-driven features, so your suggestions are helping me learn quite a bit more about the framework. While I do not believe we have a use case currently for `SourceCommitCallback` and `S3EventsSource` (see below), we may in the future if we start processing streaming data or require a long-running Spark cluster.\r\n\r\n> Please check out org.apache.hudi.utilities.callback.SourceCommitCallback and its implementing classes. This would allow you to trigger downstream jobs or logic to run.\r\n\r\nReading over my original post above, I believe I did a somewhat poor job defining our exact use case. I can provide some more details for context:\r\n\r\n- We process data in batches on a schedule.\r\n- We do not have a long-running Spark cluster.\r\n- ETL jobs run on transient Spark clusters (e.g., Amazon EMR/AWS Glue).\r\n- By the time a downstream job runs, the cluster that ran the prerequisite job does not necessarily exist anymore.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I do not believe `SourceCommitCallback` meets our use case, as the downstream job that reads the Hudi table in S3 runs on a separate schedule and (most likely) a completely different transient Spark cluster. However, please feel free to provide additional insight if I am missing something.\r\n\r\n> what Hudi APIs you referring to? you can do all the actions through PySpark\r\n\r\nRegarding my other question about exposing Hudi APIs via Python, I am referring to `HoodieTableMetaClient` itself and associated timeline classes (for example, as requested in [HUDI-1998](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1998)). However, I suppose the question could also extend to the configuration classes like `HoodieWriteConfig` and `DataSourceWriteOptions` that the 0.9.0 release notes indicate are now preferable over string variables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/929262475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/929271177","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3726#issuecomment-929271177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3726","id":929271177,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43Y42J","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T14:13:29Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T14:13:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Addressed all feedback on other PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/929271177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/929282472","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3676#issuecomment-929282472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3676","id":929282472,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBI7nWM43Y7mo","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-28T14:25:33Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T14:25:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@FelixKJose : what I meant is, you are good w/ your configs in general. just that for every commit only one small file will be packed w/ more inserts. rest of incoming records will go into new files.

you @danny0405 for the link.\r\n\r\nI am trying to set up an AWS Kinesis Application project, and as a start, I used the code provided by you in the link.\r\nAlthough I used the code below,  Kinesis complains about the hudi connector, error is supplied below. Is it because the Flink version conflict?
