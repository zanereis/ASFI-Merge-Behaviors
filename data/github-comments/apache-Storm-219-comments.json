The current implementation does not checkpoint the state of the spout, but I think it can be extended to do so either by having the checkpoint spout co-ordinating with user spouts via zookeeper or by having  the checkpoint spout act like a co-ordinator with user spouts running as bolts (similar to trident). I will put more thought around this and try to come up with a prototype. </p>\n\n<p>I am not sure I understand correctly the requirement for having a commit id in rollback.

The issue is not at least once vs exactly once, but is around failure cases and consistency.  From what I have seen with the state API + windowing offers some coordination and restore, reprocess, re-checkpoint should be idempotent, but it can only role back to the last successful checkpoint.  So if I ask all bolts to checkpoint and most succeed but one does not, I can not longer restore everyone to a consistent place, so I can start replaying again.  This is what I am concerned about.  I would like to be able to fully support the BEAM model, and then if we can offer better performance by reducing guarantees I am OK with that.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612904155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/219788238","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1419#issuecomment-219788238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1419","id":219788238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxOTc4ODIzOA==","user":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-17T17:15:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-17T17:15:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@flisky so what does your last comment mean?
