Example: `jackson.version`\r\n\r\nAnother example is `log4j2.version`, defined in `tika-parent/pom.xml`. It's used in a couple of other pom.xml files, but unnecessary there because the corresponding dependencies are already referenced/defined via the import BOM.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/1723437367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/comments/1724783427","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika/pull/1345#issuecomment-1724783427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/1345","id":1724783427,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmW85mzhtD","user":{"login":"solomax","id":3870591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3870591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax","html_url":"https://github.com/solomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-19T03:33:29Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T03:33:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm
