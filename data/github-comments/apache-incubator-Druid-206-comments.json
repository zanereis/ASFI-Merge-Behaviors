I think since the `BalancerStrategy` is the central point of decision making of where to place segments in the cluster it _must_ be aware of such a fundamental aspect of it's operation, else everything that calls into it must be aware and independently handle whether or not servers are in maintenance mode. TL;DR I don't think the `BalancerStrategy` _can_ operate correctly without knowledge of maintenance mode.\r\n\r\nI think I've already spotted a flaw in this PR in it's current state that I believe can result in undefined/unpredictable coordinator behavior that would have been remedied by the cost balancer being aware of maintenance... [dropping segments in the `LoadRule` phase](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/1cec73b22f52413c9cbfb2396463529f64b04fd9/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordinator/rules/LoadRule.java#L341). Because `drop` doesn't use the same method to get the list of server holders to consider dropping segments from as the assignment of segments, it is possible that the \"best\" server to drop from according to the balancer strategy might _not_ be a server that is marked as in maintenance when one was a candidate, producing an action that is potentially conflicting with a decision that assignment or movement might make. I think that a server in maintenance should always be the 'best' to be dropped from, and the 'worst' to be assigned to, and I don't think there is really a clean way from within `LoadRule` to handle this in the dropping case because a filter on the list of servers alone won't really produce correct behavior.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if cost balancer logic _was_ aware of maintenance, we could get by without `LoadRule` or anything else that uses the cost balancer to add/move/drop segments even being aware that maintenance mode for historical servers exist at all. And _everything_ should be using the balancer strategy to make these sorts of decisions, in order to produce as consistent and predictable behavior as possible. If the balancer strategy was aware of maintenance, [this check becomes a totally optional, slight optimization to operate on a subset of servers instead of the whole](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/1cec73b22f52413c9cbfb2396463529f64b04fd9/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordinator/rules/LoadRule.java#L156), instead of a requirement to ensure that assignment doesn't assign to a server that is in maintenance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/429981063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/429982784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6431#issuecomment-429982784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6431","id":429982784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTk4Mjc4NA==","user":{"login":"jsun98","id":11185501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTg1NTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11185501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98","html_url":"https://github.com/jsun98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsun98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T19:28:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T19:28:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gianm included the points you mentioned in the PR description\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/429982784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/429991158","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6442#issuecomment-429991158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6442","id":429991158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTk5MTE1OA==","user":{"login":"pdeva","id":3190176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTAxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3190176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva","html_url":"https://github.com/pdeva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pdeva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-15T19:56:16Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T19:56:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">Support for 64-bit floating point columns was release in Druid 0.11.0, so if this is enabled, versions older than 0.11.0 will not be able to read the data segments.\r\n\r\nthis was a little confusing when i read this first.\r\n\r\nplease consider rephrasing to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n64-bit doubles aggregators are now used by default (see #5478).

But most of all, by calling `BalancerStrategy` for each segment, it is inefficient to iterate all the servers each time to check for the flag, if you can partition them beforehand and filter them out. \r\nYes, `LoadRule` can drop a segment from an available node first indeed, that's a good catch. Still, it only matters when a node with a somewhat old cache is started and contains a segment already fully replicated somewhere, which is a rare case. The case when `LoadRule` drops a segment when it's out of the specified period rule doesn't matter, as then all the replicas got dropped that way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/430177953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/430226931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6469#issuecomment-430226931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6469","id":430226931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDIyNjkzMQ==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-16T12:57:35Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:57:35Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is a use case for having it be different than the sums of the location sizes: let's say you have 3 locations, and each could hold up to 1TB, but you don't want to store more than 2TB on the entire server.

I think I still don't fully understand what the fundamental problem is. My questions are:\r\n\r\n1) task2 looks suspicious to me.

Then, what happens if stream data is continuously ingested and there are always some running and publish pending tasks? Is it possible that this solution can work without pausing stream ingestion?\r\n\r\nProbably https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6001 can fix this as well. https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/6001 is to preserve the order of publishing segments, so that early task always publishes its segments earlier than later

All tests in KafkaSupervisorTest basically executes the below code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    supervisor.start();\r\n    supervisor.runInternal();\r\n    verifyAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `supervisor.start()` also internally calls `supervisor.runInternal()`. If this method is called twice or more, it can cause the unexpected method call errors reported above. This is not related to this PR anyway.\r\n\r\nI left one question.
