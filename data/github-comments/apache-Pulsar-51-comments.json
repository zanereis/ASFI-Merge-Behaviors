Things like configurations/policies are separated in different places, which can result in inconsistent behaviors, which make debugging much harder when issue occurs. \r\nb) doing DLQ in client means the same logic has to be implemented in different language client. The implementation can quickly become inconsistent between different language client.\r\nc) regarding the resource concerns, I don't think the resource usage is different if it is still broker tracking the redelivery count. unless there is something I am missing. \r\nd) doing DLQ in broker allows us doing optimization in future, like persisting delivery count to cursors or a retry queue, without changing client behaviors. especially if we want to support consistent behavior across different language clients.\r\n\r\n> regarding \"negative acks\"\r\n\r\n\"negative acks\" is a good thing to have. However I don't think DLQ has to depend on \"negative acks\". because the current \"negative acks\" pulsar has is ack timeout. for DLQ, it doesn't really matter it is a ack timeout or explicit ack timeout. We don't really need to tie things together. If DLQ goes first, we still can introduce \"negative acks\" later, and it will not affect DLQ logic.\r\n\r\nFrom this spective, it is making more sense to do DLQ in broker side. because when DLQ happens at broker side, when we introduce explicitly \"negative acks\" later, there will be very minimal code changes at both client and broker sides.\r\n\r\n> regarding message retention in DLQ topic\r\n\r\nI think the simplest thing is just let user configure message retention in DLQ topic. That is what typically cloud providers offer.  Not sure we need to get into the business of managing subscriptions for DLQ. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415670942/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415677594","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/2401#issuecomment-415677594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2401","id":415677594,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTY3NzU5NA==","user":{"login":"ivankelly","id":54955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly","html_url":"https://github.com/ivankelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivankelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-24T07:33:49Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T07:33:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yes, it's only a 2 line change to make it work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415677594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415720400","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/2375#issuecomment-415720400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2375","id":415720400,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTcyMDQwMA==","user":{"login":"skyrocknroll","id":426290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjI5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/426290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll","html_url":"https://github.com/skyrocknroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyrocknroll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-24T10:30:28Z","updated_at":"2018-08-24T10:30:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is an excellent feature we heavily depend on the current messaging system.

Consumer has its own credentials, but\r\n   broker will have to create a producer using the broker credentials,\r\n   after having verified that consumer also has permission to publish\r\n   on the DLQ. Worse, if we revoke the permission on the DLQ topic, we\r\n   would also have to figure that out in broker. Moving the publishing\r\n   to consumer, will make that problem go away: consumer will use the\r\n   same credentials when re-publishing and it will work same as a\r\n   regular producer.\r\n\r\n * If the consumer has a schema, it might be desirable to keep the\r\n   schema when republishing. Right now, the producer app needs to have\r\n   the Java pojo to create a schema enabled producer, but broker won't\r\n   have the Pojo definition.\r\n\r\n * In the current implementation, it's not handling the fact that\r\n   different consumers on the same subscriptions could have different\r\n   DLQ settings. Eg: `consumer-a`: 10 retries and publish on `dlq-a`\r\n   and `consumer-a` 5 retries with republish on `dlq-b`. If done on\r\n   broker side, broker would have to somehow deal with these\r\n   inconsistencies.  If the implementation is done on client library,\r\n   these inconsistencies will be fine: the broker just needs to keep\r\n   (and communicate) the current count of re-deliveries. Each consumer\r\n   will then take action based on its local configuration.\r\n\r\n> a) doing DLQ in client actually make things a bit more\r\n> complicated. because the redelivery count is tracked at\r\n> broker, but the publishing happens at the client. Things like\r\n> configurations/policies are separated in different places,\r\n> which can result in inconsistent behaviors, which make\r\n> debugging much harder when issue occurs.\r\n\r\nThe current PR is anyway configuring the DLQ in client API. If we\r\nwere to configure the DLQ as a server side policy we would probably\r\nneed to have fine-grained policies per-topic (while currently these\r\nare only at the namespace level, except for authorization which is\r\nboth at namespace and topic level). For DLQ it would even be at\r\nthe subscription level.\r\n\r\n> b) doing DLQ in client means the same logic has to be implemented in\r\n>  different language client. The implementation can quickly become\r\n>  inconsistent between different language client.\r\n\r\nThis I agree. It would require to do implementation in both Java and C++\r\nclient (plus the wrappers). My hope is that the client implementation\r\nwould be not be very complicated.\r\n\r\n> c) regarding the resource concerns, I don't think the resource usage\r\n>  is different if it is still broker tracking the redelivery\r\n>  count. unless there is something I am missing.\r\n\r\nWell, the difference here would be that broker just need to keep only\r\na counter, inside a map there already exist.\r\n\r\nIf the broker is doing the publishes, then it needs to create and cache\r\nproducers for all the DLQ topics. If each consumer has its own producers, \r\nthis could greatly increase the memory consumption in broker and we would\r\nhave to carefully tune the producer queues to make sure we don't get out \r\nof direct memory in the worst case scenarios.\r\n\r\n> d) doing DLQ in broker allows us doing optimization in future, like\r\n>  persisting delivery count to cursors or a retry queue, without\r\n>  changing client behaviors. especially if we want to support\r\n>  consistent behavior across different language clients.\r\n\r\nOptmizations like storing the counter would possible in either case.\r\n\r\n> \"negative acks\" is a good thing to have. However I don't think DLQ\r\n>  has to depend on \"negative acks\". because the current \"negative\r\n>  acks\" pulsar has is ack timeout. for DLQ, it doesn't really matter\r\n>  it is a ack timeout or explicit ack timeout. We don't really need to\r\n>  tie things together. If DLQ goes first, we still can introduce\r\n>  \"negative acks\" later, and it will not affect DLQ logic.\r\n\r\nSure, we can defer \"negative acks\" changes and just focus on current\r\nre-delivery functionality.\r\n\r\n> I think the simplest thing is just let user configure message\r\n>  retention in DLQ topic. That is what typically cloud providers\r\n>  offer. Not sure we need to get into the business of managing\r\n>  subscriptions for DLQ.\r\n\r\nAgain, the problem lies with policies which are currently namespace\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nI believe the best compromise solution we can adopt initially is to\r\nleave the freedom to the user. The documenation will clearly specify\r\nthat you need to make sure the data is retained in the DLQ and present\r\nfew alternatives, eg:\r\n\r\n```\r\npulsar-admin topics create-subscribtion my-topic-dlq --subscription dlq\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this command, one can make sure that every message pushed to the\r\n`my-topic-dql` will be retained (indefinitely) and it will be\r\naccessible through the subscription named `dlq`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415917621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415926740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2444#issuecomment-415926740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2444","id":415926740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTkyNjc0MA==","user":{"login":"srkukarni","id":2530234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzAyMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2530234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni","html_url":"https://github.com/srkukarni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkukarni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-25T02:40:25Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T02:40:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"run cpp tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415926740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415927753","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2400#issuecomment-415927753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2400","id":415927753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTkyNzc1Mw==","user":{"login":"rdhabalia","id":2898254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2898254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia","html_url":"https://github.com/rdhabalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdhabalia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-25T02:52:47Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T02:52:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with @merlimat , I can see two major drawbacks with server-side implementation, which may prevent us to enable this feature with high traffic pulsar system: \r\na. memory footprint required by producer queues\r\nb. authroization handling because publish will happen on-behalf of consumer by broker.\r\n\r\nDLQ mainly requires count of message redelivery and then publish max-redelivered message  to the DLQ.

We can enforce DLQ topic rentention when we allow overriding policies at topic/subscription level.\r\n\r\n@merlimat @rdhabalia can you confirm the summary is correct?\r\n\r\n@codelipenghui does this approach work for your application?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415930019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/415938320","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2400#issuecomment-415938320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/2400","id":415938320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTkzODMyMA==","user":{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-25T05:15:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T05:15:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie Yes, it's approach work for me.
