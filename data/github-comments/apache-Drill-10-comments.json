Looks like that the change you made would cause incorrect result when the input string is a udf-8 with each character consisting of multiple bytes. In particular, the original implementation would encode the byte array with udf-8 (which is the default encoding in drill). However, in your CharSequenceWrapper, you will treat each byte as a character. This will cause incorrect result for case when a character is represented by >1 bytes.\n\nFor instance, look at the following example, the first query of regexp_matches will produce wrong result. \n\n{code:sql}\nselect regexp_matches('München', 'München') res3 from (values(1));\n+--------+\n|  res3  |\n+--------+\n| false  |\n+--------+\n1 row selected (0.148 seconds)\n0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> select regexp_matches('abc', 'abc') from (values(1));\n+---------+\n| EXPR$0  |\n+---------+\n| true    |\n+---------+\n1 row selected (0.189 seconds)\n0: jdbc:drill:zk=local> select 'München' = 'München' res1 from (values(1));\n+-------+\n| res1  |\n+-------+\n| true  |\n+-------+\n1 row selected (0.186 seconds)\n{code:sql}\n\nHere is the result for 1st query, without your patch\n\n{code:sql}\nselect regexp_matches('München', 'München') res3 from (values(1));\n+-------+\n| res3  |\n+-------+\n| true  |\n+-------+\n{code:sql}\n\nI think you should modify CharSequenceWrapper, so that the encoding method is honored.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/219858967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/220095583","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/480#issuecomment-220095583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/480","id":220095583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDA5NTU4Mw==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T17:13:20Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T17:13:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Rebased on latest master.\n\n@parthchandra and @adeneche please review?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/220095583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/220096053","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/426#issuecomment-220096053","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/426","id":220096053,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDA5NjA1Mw==","user":{"login":"sudheeshkatkam","id":3272600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3272600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam","html_url":"https://github.com/sudheeshkatkam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sudheeshkatkam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-18T17:15:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T17:15:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@adeneche please review.

Maybe you can seek help from others in the community (I believe @adityakishore runs on windows + cygwin). —\n   You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n   Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/226895545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/226922392","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/527#issuecomment-226922392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/527","id":226922392,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjkyMjM5Mg==","user":{"login":"amansinha100","id":6034475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzQ0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6034475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100","html_url":"https://github.com/amansinha100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amansinha100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-18T05:04:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T05:04:49Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@vkorukanti can this go in after the 1.7 release ?
