Now I see the need for PR #2343.\r\n@khos2ow I think we need to revisit and move that PR forward. \r\n\r\nTravis is already using Maven 3.5, so the problem is not due to maven version there. I believe the problem is due to \"dependency-check-maven\" first run, when it downloads and processes CVEs to populate its local database.\r\n\r\n@DaanHoogland we need to add `travis_wait <someValueBiggerThan10>` in front of `install: ./tools/travis/install.sh` directive. Something like `install: travis_wait 30 ./tools/travis/install.sh`\r\n\r\n[1] http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/Re-Build-failed-in-Jenkins-maven-plugins-ITs-m3-972-td5755380.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/366997501/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367004703","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2463#issuecomment-367004703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2463","id":367004703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzAwNDcwMw==","user":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T15:00:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T15:00:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@blueorangutan package","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367004703/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367004892","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2463#issuecomment-367004892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2463","id":367004892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzAwNDg5Mg==","user":{"login":"blueorangutan","id":16489489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg5NDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16489489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan","html_url":"https://github.com/blueorangutan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueorangutan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T15:01:31Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T15:01:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@rhtyd a Jenkins job has been kicked to build packages.

Once the migrarion thread is marked as finished, the migration monitoring process (while loop) ends and the migration command wrapper would continue its execution.\r\nRegarding your last question, we won't need to suspend the VM in this case as the migration has already been performed. VM suspension will take place whenever the migration is in progress and those conditions are met","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367991052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367993109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2392#issuecomment-367993109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2392","id":367993109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Nzk5MzEwOQ==","user":{"login":"greut","id":1388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut","html_url":"https://github.com/greut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-23T12:11:34Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T12:11:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rafaelweingartner I don't mind rebasing it against 4.11 if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367993109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/comments/367993667","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2392#issuecomment-367993667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/2392","id":367993667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Nzk5MzY2Nw==","user":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-23T12:14:42Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T12:14:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"ok, now you pointed the PR to master.
