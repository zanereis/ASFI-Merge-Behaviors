I've also added weighted true positive and false positive and confusion matrix. \n\nRegarding raw scores, as you asked in one of the previous messages, now I think it is possible to incorporate them, if they will be between 0 and 1. There will be default parameter in constructor: raw: Boolean = false. The question is how the interface of this class will change. Probably, adding receiver-operating characteristic ROC: Array[Double, Double] will be enough. I don't think adding all kinds of precision: Array[Double, Double] etc will be beneficial. What do you think?\n\nBtw., I suggest to change MulticlassMetrics to MulticlassMeasures, because it doesn't provide metrics strictly speaking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48590095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/48592365","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1155#issuecomment-48592365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1155","id":48592365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTkyMzY1","user":{"login":"SparkQA","id":8108735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8108735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA","html_url":"https://github.com/SparkQA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SparkQA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-10T11:20:17Z","updated_at":"2014-07-10T11:20:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"QA
