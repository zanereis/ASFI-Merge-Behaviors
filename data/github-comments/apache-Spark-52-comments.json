If data to be joined are already sorted by join keys, merge join would be done more efficiently than hash join. In my test case, both algorithms were almost same speed, but merge join was scalable.\n2. Merge join for sorted data by the same keys would be pipelined (each output can be produced immediately for arrived input tuples) even if N-way join (N>2). Hash join blocks due to building a hash-table before output are produced.\n\nI think it is useful for users to choose ways to optimize their processing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39417683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39418052","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/195#issuecomment-39418052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/195","id":39418052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDE4MDUy","user":{"login":"AndreSchumacher","id":3220544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjA1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3220544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/AndreSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndreSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T06:50:07Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T06:50:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@marmbrus Great, thanks a lot.

I should have looked more at this. The dependency is just to bring in some annotations that were later standardized. We do not use them, and so do not need any copy, including from Guava. This could be omitted, as it does not enable running Findbugs anyway.\n\nI have the formula for adding a Findbugs plugin to the build. It's not hard. As I say in the JIRA, it would not do much good in a Scala-based project.\n\n(IntelliJ does have good Scala static analysis. I'd like to take a crack at fixing all the stuff it's found. These are big PR-busting changes unfortunately so I've not suggested many. It only gets harder later, so seems like worth doing soon if at all, but it's so so busy!)\n\nUpdating Guava is good per se; it's a bit perilous when you get near Hadoop since even current versions use Hadoop 11.0.2, and when executing code within a Hadoop classloader, you'll end up linking against it's old version in the parent classpath. I think we've had this discussion before -- it is somewhat less of an issue for Spark but I confess I haven't though through whether it is actually a non-issue. The project is already on 14, hmm.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39429880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39431227","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/312#issuecomment-39431227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/312","id":39431227,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDMxMjI3","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T09:27:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T09:27:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39431227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39431524","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/312#issuecomment-39431524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/312","id":39431524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDMxNTI0","user":{"login":"scwf","id":7018048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTgwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7018048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf","html_url":"https://github.com/scwf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scwf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T09:30:43Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T09:30:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"TaskSchedulerImpl should override rootPool method\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39431524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39432280","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/268#issuecomment-39432280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/268","id":39432280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDMyMjgw","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T09:40:09Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T09:40:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Build finished.

We can add the management stuff later, although would be nice for 1.0. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39453542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39454420","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/204#issuecomment-39454420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/204","id":39454420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDU0NDIw","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T14:03:35Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T14:59:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"First of all I would like to say great work, having this history server is awesome!!\n\nI'm trying it out on a non-secure yarn cluster but when I run something that accesses hdfs (SparkHdfsLR) the application ends up failing because HDFS has already been closed when it goes to logEvent.

For example, even though https://github.com/markhamstra/spark is technically a public repo and people could have forked it and be depending on the history in my repo, as a practical matter nobody is going to be using it that way, but instead will be relying upon the canonical upstream repo, https://github.com/apache/spark.  That means that if I am working on a PR in a feature branch Foo, then the easiest and cleanest way to keep my Foo work mergeable with the master branch of Spark is to only 'pull --rebase' the upstream master, not merge pull, thereby avoiding merge commit clutter and the interleaving of my work with other commits to master.  Instead, my PR commits will appear last and be applied only after the current state of master.\n\nThat means that the SHAs of my commits will be changing in my repo (but not those of any commits already in master), but nobody should be relying upon those until after they are in master anyway.  Each rebase on an open PR will also cause Jenkins/Travis to re-run the tests, but that's no big deal unless you are rebasing really frequently and unnecessarily.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39485564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39486891","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/307#issuecomment-39486891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/307","id":39486891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDg2ODkx","user":{"login":"markhamstra","id":424186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDE4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra","html_url":"https://github.com/markhamstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markhamstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-03T18:25:53Z","updated_at":"2014-04-03T18:25:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like just removing the findbugs jsr305 dependency entirely works fine, but bumping the Guava version not so much.
