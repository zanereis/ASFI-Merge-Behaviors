If you will look on what is currently implemented, each remote observer is a two ways communication channel, it allows to both write and read, and reads are delegated to the registered observers (that are disposables). So the non caching implementation is still a remote manager, not a factory. Probably the best option is to introduce additional methods to the IRemoteManager interface that will create NonCachableRemoteObservers that will implement both IObserver and IDisposable.
