Haven't investigated this particular problem, but thought I'd mention it here in case that is it.\r\n\r\n@vorburger Thanks! Found the issue: there is a bug in OpenJDK 11.0.2. They've implemented SSL connection reuse, but the reuse discards all the certificates shared during the earlier use of the connection, which results in this error. relaxedHTTPSValidation doesn't help as it still expects some certificate, and in this case there is none. \r\n\r\nThe issue is fixed in later OpenJDK 11 builds (e.g. 11.0.7) which is what I have on my own machine, and hence I did not see this. However Travis pulls in 11.0.2 and I was not able to find an easy way to get it to use a later minor version. \r\n\r\nSo I fixed the Travis build by getting it to use OpenJDK 12 which has this fix. I'm assuming that will still be OK, because in the Gradle file we specify JDK 11. Alternatively need to find some way to get Travis to download and install 11.0.7 instead...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/625004656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/625009848","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/820#issuecomment-625009848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/820","id":625009848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTAwOTg0OA==","user":{"login":"ptuomola","id":2398858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola","html_url":"https://github.com/ptuomola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptuomola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T03:34:43Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T03:34:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@xurror @awasum I found the SSL issue (bug in OpenJDK) and all the tests now seem to pass, so this should be ready for your review.

Shouldn't be a problem to fix that.\r\n\r\nYes - I fixed a few hundred depreciated / unchecked warnings, but looks like I missed this one. \r\n\r\nIt's actually a bit of a funny case: in some tests, getStaffListWithState returns ArrayList<<HashMap<String, Object>> whereas in some other tests it returns LinkedHashMap. The former is in cases where it is called with expected parameters - the latter when called with invalid parameters. Given this, the obvious solution of just changing the return type from Object to something more specific doesn't really work. \r\n\r\nI suppose I could just get the compiler to shut up with either SuppressWarnings or with an explicit Class.cast().

JDK!!! I'm just curious, did you notice this by comparison of Travis's VS local JDK version numbers, or do you have a link to a OpenJDK bug about this?\n\nUsing JDK 12 instead of 11 can't stay long, because even though Gradle specifies 11, that will only cause javac to allow only 11 SYNTAX, but it will still allow to build with use of 12 LIBRARIES - I've dealt with related problems in other projects, over the years.

JDK!!! I'm just curious, did you notice this by comparison of Travis's VS local JDK version numbers, or do you have a link to a OpenJDK bug about this?\r\n\r\nI found it by turning on the SSL debug logging and stepping through the SSL handshakes / negotiation. But once I worked out what's going on, it was easy to find a JDK bug that someone else had raised on the same issue and that has been fixed in a later JDK minor version (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212885 - TLS 1.3 resumed session does not retain peer certificate chain)\r\n \r\n> Using JDK 12 instead of 11 can't stay long, because even though Gradle specifies 11, that will only cause javac to allow only 11 SYNTAX, but it will still allow to build with use of 12 LIBRARIES - I've dealt with related problems in other projects, over the years. But what I think we should do due to OpenJDK bug is still do this, for now, merge, but then change it \"soon\". I volunteer to look into it for Travis later. Perhaps create a new JIRA dedicated to \"Switch Travis from Java 12 to Java 11\" (and assign it to me)?\r\n\r\nThat makes sense. There are some possible ways suggested on how to get a specific version of OpenJDK on different sites - e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29636754/can-you-specify-minor-jdk-version-for-travis-ci. However none of them seemed particularly \"clean\". \r\n\r\nI also considered upgrading the whole Linux distro being used by Travis to a newer version (probably a good idea anyway). But unfortunately the newer distro version still uses the same script to pull OpenJDK, and hence seemed to end up with the same JDK version. \r\n\r\n> As for javac compiler warnings, let's fix in follow up PRs. Personally I may even have left the warning instead of suppressing, as a reminder, but it really doesn't matter, ignore.\r\n\r\nI've left this for now. \r\n\r\n> I was also going to suggest that this could have been broken up into separate PRs first for all the code changes, while still on Java 8, and then figure out make the Java 11 build changes, but seeing your breakthrough, I'll get this in ASAP; so more of a suggestion for future smaller PRs.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion - will in the future submit smaller PRs. There are still a couple of cleanups I think would make sense - e.g. there's still a depreciation warning from Gradle, and some of the Gradle plugins are not at their latest versions - but I can submit those as separate PRs. \r\n\r\nThanks again","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/625167037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/625485682","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/820#issuecomment-625485682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/820","id":625485682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTQ4NTY4Mg==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-07T20:40:36Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T20:40:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FINERACT-937 created re Java 12 -> 11 on Travis.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/625485682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/comments/625747497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/828#issuecomment-625747497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/fineract/issues/828","id":625747497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTc0NzQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"vorburger","id":298598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODU5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger","html_url":"https://github.com/vorburger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vorburger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T10:19:57Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T10:19:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nemux Thank You for this!!
