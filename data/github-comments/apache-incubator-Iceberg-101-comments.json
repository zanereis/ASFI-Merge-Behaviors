Probably worth brainstorming in the dev list.\r\n\r\nWell, in fact, there are already some implicit conversions on the computing engine side, and both spark and flink have some conventional support. If we need to cover all conversion support, we also need to add some test verification.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/881836475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/881873529","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2832#issuecomment-881873529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2832","id":881873529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX840kFJ5","user":{"login":"electrum","id":9230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum","html_url":"https://github.com/electrum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-17T10:29:59Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T10:29:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I object to this change.

We discussed this at our sync this morning and the rough consensus was to notify users that this is an issue, but not implement the change to filter projection. There were two main reasons: (1) there are other operations that use bucketing (joins) and bad partition values can't be fixed in those cases and (2) supporting the work-around once Guava is fixed will be difficult and require us to keep the buggy Guava code in Iceberg.\r\n\r\nLike you said bucketing by arbitrary string inputs with these characters should be fairly rare. Someone might bucket by a UUID string, but those are predictable and don't use non-BMP characters.\r\n\r\nOur current plan is to fix the hash implementation and include the issue in release notes. We're also working on a way to repartition data in an action, so that should help people that are caught by this. In the meantime, we can tell people how to use MERGE INTO to fix the bad data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/884562950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/884613231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2372#issuecomment-884613231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2372","id":884613231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX840uiBv","user":{"login":"chenjunjiedada","id":3960228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjAyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3960228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada","html_url":"https://github.com/chenjunjiedada","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenjunjiedada/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-22T02:14:58Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T02:14:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@rdblue @openinx @jackye1995 Any other comments on this?
