The cli is instructed to create a sequence and the component action does not have a namespace. The cli infers it as being default (i.e., `_`) and then fills it in with info from `.wskprops`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReq Body\r\n{{\"exec\":{\"kind\":\"sequence\",\"code\":\"\",\"components\":[\"/ioana@us.ibm.com_dev/package2/print\"]}}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(note the namespace; it should be guest for my local run or `_`)\r\n\r\nI can confirm that if the default namespace is explicit, the cli works properly.\r\n\r\nIf I don't have a `.wskprops` file, I can confirm that the default package is inferred as `_` by the cli. \r\n\r\nI'll push my changes to a branch such that this issue can be reproduced easily.
