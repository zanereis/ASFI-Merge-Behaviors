As @lukemetz mentioned, refactoring with functions makes it a bit messier because a lot of local variables needs to be passed around. That is also the primary reason that I did not attempt to refactor this big method while implementing the Julia side.\n\nThat being said, I think I will not adapt the refactoring to the Julia side soon (but I'm not objecting if someone else want to do it), because I agree with @tqchen that refactoring is typically triggered by code sharing. At least before we added other models (RNNs, for example), I did not see how those code pieces are going to be used elsewhere. I think after this PR gets merged, @lukemetz maybe could show some examples of how he needs to write his own training loop and how the refactored code architecture makes it easier to do it.

I quickly browsed your code base and found you've already finished the NDArray and IO part, and you really did a nice work. From my side, I just finished the NDArray class (with a few test cases).

work! Think this is a really good example. It illustrates how to write an DataIter for custom data and how to write custom solver for custom model.\n\nWe have got a lot of questions for how to do this. It would be great if you can summarize your work into a tutorial on how to feed data and how to do custom bind and solve.\nAlso, given that you had to write a new solver from scratch, what do you think about the _train_multi_device refactoring here https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/909? Maybe you can refactor your solver to use ExecutorManager and improve the interface in the process?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164899760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/164901246","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/946#issuecomment-164901246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/946","id":164901246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDkwMTI0Ng==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T21:24:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T21:24:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Could
