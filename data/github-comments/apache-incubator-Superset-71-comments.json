I thus agree with @mistercrunch that an \"open field instead of guided flow\" is more appropriate for \"analytics at the speed of thought\". But I've also been thinking of how to narrow the gap and allow for slightly more \"guided flows\" without compromising on flexibility. These are my current thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Extend the \"table as filter\" option to bar charts and pie charts for dashboards. This will cover the case where customers just want to click a slice on the piechart to filter the rest of the dashboard. \r\n\r\n2. When clicking on \"Explore this graph\" in a dashboard that has filters applied, open the explore view with the same filters applied to the slice. This is perhaps the biggest point of confusion for our users at the moment: having to reapply the filters in the Explore view, especially since the filter there does not auto-complete like in the dashboard.\r\n\r\n3. Allow slices (in one dashboard) to act as a portal to another dashboard. Currently we just add a link in the slice description to related dashboards, but it would be really cool if you could select a \"related dashboard\" from a dropdown in the \"edit slice\" view from the dashboard, and then (for example) when clicking on a a country in the World map slice the \"Sales\" dashboard open up with the country applied as filter.\r\n\r\nI've not looked into the technical feasibility of these yet (or even if it's already addressed in versions since Superset v0.17.0!), but do you think it's worth exploring these ideas?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/305984506/reactions","total_count":24,"+1":24,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/306016108","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/2890#issuecomment-306016108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2890","id":306016108,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjAxNjEwOA==","user":{"login":"sougatabh","id":895604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTYwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/895604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh","html_url":"https://github.com/sougatabh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sougatabh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-04T03:46:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-04T03:46:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks @mistercrunch @jr-minnaar  for your answer.\r\nMy use case : Assume I have a page showing multiple KPI chart geo wise, assume page has 5 charts a pie, a Bar a table blah, blah, blah..

bad I forgot to run superset init : ) Then changes at #1799 still work for current version! Now I'm able to grant dashboard-based permission to each role, but I still need to manually grant database or datasource permission to the role. I would like to have all datasources in the dashboard be automatically granted permission to role once the dashboard permission has been granted, just like when granting permission to the entire database. How should I go about to change that? Specifically, I am still confused on where is the code that handles any changes made on role's permission. If some one could explain to me where does that module like in I would greatly appreciate it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/306423477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/306427827","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/1799#issuecomment-306427827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1799","id":306427827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjQyNzgyNw==","user":{"login":"fufjvnvnf","id":20451799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUxNzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20451799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf","html_url":"https://github.com/fufjvnvnf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fufjvnvnf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T09:10:52Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T09:11:18Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't think this change does anything.

Hit query, I get 1.497016382e+12, or GMT: Friday, 9 of June 2017 13:53:02, wich is wrong, since my timezone is 3 hours behind. The expected result should be GMT: Friday, 9 of June 2017 16:53:02.\r\n\r\nMy sugestion is to use the function gmtime() as a sourceTime for cal.parse, so that the timestamp returned is in UTC, not in localtime. I know that GMT and UTC are not the same, but I didn't find on parsedatetime a seemingly function.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is the best solution, but it worked, at least to the human readeble strings, but we later realized that the problem still persists when using expressions that are parsed by the dateutil.parser.\r\n\r\nHope it helps and thank you again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/307445679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/307452017","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/2938#issuecomment-307452017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/2938","id":307452017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzQ1MjAxNw==","user":{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-09T17:35:17Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T17:35:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"please
