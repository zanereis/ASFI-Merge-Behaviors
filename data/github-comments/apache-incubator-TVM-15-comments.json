In order to perform those checks I need to run the initial passes of lowering, i.e., `Schedule::normalize()` and `Schedule::InferBound()`. Obviously, I don't modify the original schedule.\r\nHowever, there are still some more checks that are done in `StorageFlattener` that are not in `Stage::autotensorize()`. Specifically, those checks are in `StorageFlattener::HandleBufferBindScope()`, including the ones enforced by `ArgBinder::BindBuffer()` called by `HandleBufferBindScope()`. \r\nI still don't fully understand `AttrStmt` and how `HandleBufferBindScope()` works.

You know what, after looking at some documentation and source code, I realized that glfw already includes `gl.h` / `gl3.h` for you internally.\r\n\r\nCould you try removing both `#include <GL/gl.h>`

GLFW_INCLUDE_GLCOREARB\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother thing is, if `GL_STACK_OVERFLOW` and `GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW` are not present in `gl3.h`, could you just remove the case in
