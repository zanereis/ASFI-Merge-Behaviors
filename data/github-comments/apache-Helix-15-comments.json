I think adding default value logic needs to be delivered to the user as well. They need to understand how Helix locates an instance. It is a Helix API eventually. If the rest API tells the user that this node has no definition, but internally, it is rebalanced as in the default fault zone, then it would be very confusing.\r\n2. Topology.java supports all possible Domain definition, not only 2 levels. Although the other layers are not used by the rebalancer, you can get the full tree structure from Topology.java if simply adding a method that traverses the tree like you what you are doing in this new class. I'm not aware of the necessity of rewriting.\r\n3. faultZoneType is purely optional.\r\n4. I agree that the trie data structure is more preferred. But it seems not a must for this requirement.

Users can specify target task pool sizes on either the cluster-level or on the instance-level by setting either GLOBAL_TARGET_TASK_THREAD_POOL_SIZE in ClusterConfig or TARGET_TASK_THREAD_POOL_SIZE in InstanceConfig. After JVM restart, an instance will have a pool with the specified size for task threads.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/683130238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/683212819","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1331#issuecomment-683212819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1331","id":683212819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzIxMjgxOQ==","user":{"login":"huizhilu","id":5187721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODc3MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5187721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu","html_url":"https://github.com/huizhilu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huizhilu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-29T01:24:43Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T01:33:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lei-xia \r\nThis is a test log to prove prefetch is done in zkclient:\r\n```\r\nSTART test at Fri Aug 28 18:14:19 PDT 2020\r\n==== update instance config\r\nPrefetch data for path /TestCallbackPrefetch/CONFIGS/PARTICIPANT/localhost_12918\r\n=== after \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, no prefetch:\r\n```\r\nSTART test at Fri Aug 28 18:17:51 PDT 2020\r\n==== update instance config\r\n=== after\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/683212819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/comments/683301756","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1329#issuecomment-683301756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1329","id":683301756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzMwMTc1Ng==","user":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-29T14:59:03Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T14:59:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This PR is ready to be merged.\r\n\r\nFinal commit message:\r\nContinue pipeline if currentState is null\r\n\r\nIn this commit, if controller encounters null currentStates, it will\r\ncontinue the pipeline and TaskSchedulingStage.

There are some failing tests though, so what we want to do is\r\n\r\n1. Build the project at the top-level project path (where the parent pom.xml is): mvn clean install package -DskipTests\r\n2. Run tests for separate modules (e.g. /helix-core, /zookeeper-api, /helix-rest, /helix-common, etc)\r\nUsually these 4 modules cover everything. Other modules have some failing tests, so I wouldn't be too concerned about those.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of /helix-core, you should see all tests pass. For helix-core, we see as many as 3-4 failing tests depending on the machine (we are currently trying to stabilize tests). At that point, we run these tests individually using the following mvn command:\r\nmvn test -Dtest=<your test name>\r\n\r\nUsually when the failed tests are run individually, they pass. If they don't that means something went wrong.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful for us to know which tests are failing exactly as well. You could document that in your pull request draft as well.\r\n\r\nIf this is helpful, you're more than welcome to add this piece of information on the wiki page sidebar for future contributors.
