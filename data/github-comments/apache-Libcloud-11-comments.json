Catching the exception in `_ssh_client_connect` could be a solution.\n2. The key isn't invalid. I've been debugging this issue for a while and I'm sure this isn't it. The problem is that the failed SSH connection is caused by the key not being installed on the target node yet. It tries to SSH before the key has been installed, and by extension, Paramiko fails to connect, which results in it trying to use the key as DSA since RSA has failed, and that also fails of course. I've come to this conclusion through debugging with @ralphbean. The key parsing isn't the issue -- I'm 100% sure of this. As you guessed, this error is covering up another issue: the SSH key not being installed yet.\n3. This is an exception that is thrown, not debug log output. An exception is thrown that libcloud covers up, which is related to an exception that paramiko covers up (ugh). So we used `import traceback; traceback.print_exc()` and another `traceback` function that escapes me at the moment to get the full exceptions to _actually_ print out. This is how we figured out that the issue was not with the key parsing but with the key not being installed yet.\n\nI'm gonna pop in to the code again and see if I can use the `timeout` arguments to fix the problem, but my issue is this: the argument is written as `timeout=300`, so the timeout is _already_ set to a large value, but the code fails way faster than 300 seconds, so I had to assume that the timeout argument wasn't helping the right things. I'll try it now, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/47458193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/47458513","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/331#issuecomment-47458513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/331","id":47458513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDU4NTEz","user":{"login":"dtgay","id":1376599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzY1OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1376599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay","html_url":"https://github.com/dtgay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-29T15:52:13Z","updated_at":"2014-06-29T15:52:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yeah, that `timeout=60` and `wait_period=10` _definitely_ does not solve the problem.

thanks for the comments, will try to fix them as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the sshkey stuff, I still don't know if getting the local generation for ssh keys before uploading its an ok thing and could be implemented across libcloud.\n\nThing is, some(all?) of the cloud providers allow you to import an ssh key, but for that we need a method to generate one, upload the public part and return to the user the keypair object (public and private) so I believe it would be good if it could be used across all drivers as a new generic method. For automation purpouses it makes too much sense (we are doing it that way internally, on node creation we generate a new key from scratch for each machine, but as libcloud does not support it we are doing it outside of it)\n\nIt requires a new dependecy thougth, pycrypto.\n\nCheers!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/53967038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/53982579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/321#issuecomment-53982579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/321","id":53982579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTgyNTc5","user":{"login":"Itxaka","id":1447686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDc2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1447686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka","html_url":"https://github.com/Itxaka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Itxaka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-31T09:28:51Z","updated_at":"2014-08-31T09:28:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@Kami Everything modified to confirm to the proper guidelines and all tests passing :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/53982579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/53989579","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/321#issuecomment-53989579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/321","id":53989579,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTg5NTc5","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-31T14:29:10Z","updated_at":"2014-08-31T14:29:10Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Itxaka Thanks.\n\nI'm having troubles applying this patch on top of trunk (I would squash the commits myself).

`PROVISIONING_STATE` dictionary contains strings as keys.
