It will also work for columns defined as VARCHAR2 (or CHAR) and that hold dates in string format. The catch for this later case is that the string should correspond to the NLS_DATE_FORMAT of the session (i.e. superset connection). I'm new to superset, and have no idea how this can be done (easy from any oracle client: alter session set nls_date_format='.....').\r\nAs for the PR, Can you do it please? I'm newer to github than to superset, so it would help a lot if you can. As for the UPPERCASE, that's a good idea, not because it is more Oracleish (it is not), but because it makes for more readable code.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/450226701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/450227734","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6571#issuecomment-450227734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6571","id":450227734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDIyNzczNA==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-27T20:43:57Z","updated_at":"2018-12-27T20:43:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/450227734/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/450264664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/6575#issuecomment-450264664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/6575","id":450264664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDI2NDY2NA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-28T00:54:53Z","updated_at":"2018-12-28T00:54:53Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The

The color difference between the light and dark grey should serve as a natural divide between code and the button area (i.e. code in the light grey area only). When the scorbar comes up, it would only scroll the code area.\r\n \r\nI'm not sure where we want to left-align the 'Run Query' button. It looks a bit odd somehow to me to have it aligned \"into the gutter\" (now that the button area is the same grey, the left end of it looks like an extension of the gutter to me). \r\n\r\nI was thinking perhaps we could align it to the right side of the gutter. As @thinmatt pointed out, the gutter of the ace editor (code area) resizes based on the digits of the line number so in order to align the buttons to the right side of the gutter, we would need to reposition the buttons as the code area grows, which is silly. One possible way around it is to push all the buttons to the right. Perhaps?
