Note that it's been this way for a while. I did not introduce this mapping in #442.\n\n```\n    NODE_STATE_MAP = {\n        \"PROVISIONING\": NodeState.PENDING,\n        \"STAGING\": NodeState.PENDING,\n        \"RUNNING\": NodeState.RUNNING,\n        \"STOPPED\": NodeState.TERMINATED,\n        \"STOPPING\": NodeState.TERMINATED,\n        \"TERMINATED\": NodeState.TERMINATED\n    }\n```\n\nI think what you're proposing is to change it to:\n\n```\n    NODE_STATE_MAP = {\n        \"PROVISIONING\": NodeState.PENDING,\n        \"STAGING\": NodeState.PENDING,\n        \"RUNNING\": NodeState.RUNNING,\n        \"STOPPING\": NodeState.STOPPED,\n        \"TERMINATED\": NodeState.STOPPED\n    }\n```\n\nNote, that I removed STOPPED since we don't (no longer?) have that state[2].

— the `update_pricing_file()` function in that file is a complex way of saying `json.dumps(indent=4, sort_keys=True)` — it produces the same output. I used the Python script in this PR to regenerate the entire JSON file and did not affect anything around it other than adding the new `\"google\"` section.\n\nMy goal after committing this PR is to refactor the `main()` method in my script to become a general driver which reads the current JSON file, calls out to the different providers to update the structure, and then writes it out to disk. As you can see in my script, the phases are clearly delineated and the provider-specific update functions can be called from the middle of the script.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/74891415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/74923992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/451#issuecomment-74923992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/451","id":74923992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTIzOTky","user":{"login":"allardhoeve","id":1262726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1262726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve","html_url":"https://github.com/allardhoeve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allardhoeve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-18T18:55:47Z","updated_at":"2015-02-18T18:55:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Docstring

Is that why it was setup as an extension and not the standard method?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/75431273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/75432065","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/460#issuecomment-75432065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/460","id":75432065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDMyMDY1","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-22T11:54:19Z","updated_at":"2015-02-22T13:00:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed minor lint and version compatibility issue (968425c62da91b271b04975c5fa5b062f88594f6) and merged changes into trunk.
