repurposed this issue and make it more general to reflect the problems with the current cli. \nHere it is another example and how to reproduce it. The example has to do with invoking an action in blocking fashion with an action that takes longer than the response timeout for blocking actions (NOTE: do not confuse the response timeout for blocking actions (i.e., how long the http connection is open) with the timeout for running the action (i.e., how long the action will be allowed to run)). Internally, the request will behave as if the action invocation was \"morphed\" into a non-blocking invocation. The response from the cli should indicate that this request was morphed into a non-blocking invocation. \n\nThe response code from the REST API is a 202 and this should somehow be communicated to the cli user. \n\nWhat happens now (and steps to reproduce)\n\nCreate an action `sleep` using our `timeout.js` file and set the timeout to 120 seconds:\n`action create sleep tests/dat/actions/timeout.js -t 120000`\nInvoke the action blocking fashion:\n`action invoke -b sleep -p payload 100000`\n\nWhat I get is this:\n\n```\nok: invoked /_/sleep with id 81df7ec28bf2480d98942fc85ed134d5\n{\n    \"namespace\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"version\": \"\",\n    \"publish\": false,\n    \"subject\": \"\",\n    \"activationId\": \"81df7ec28bf2480d98942fc85ed134d5\",\n    \"start\": 0,\n

\"annotations\": null\n}\n```\n\nThe activation record is something that the cli made up. \n\nWhat happens under the cover is this:\n(same invocation as above with -v)\n\n``` REQUEST:\n[POST]  https://192.168.99.100/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/sleep?blocking=true\nReq Headers\n{\n  \"Authorization\": [...\n  ],\n  \"Content-Type\": [\n    \"application/json\"\n  ]\n}Req Body\n{{\"payload\":100000}\n}\nRESPONSE:Got response with code 202\nResponse body size is 56 bytes\nResponse body received:\n{\n  \"activationId\": \"bacdd8898db745c3b8c3cb5c04d969f3\"\n}\nok:

translation.
