(https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-ace/issues/73)\nWe would need to Bump to newer version (0.2.x), but those versions have breaking changes.\nI pretty much figured out what we need to change, but can't guarantee that everything would be working (it would take lot of time to manually test + write tests). which would delay more this PR.\nSo the best would be to do the test later.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/138243255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/138292992","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/206#issuecomment-138292992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/206","id":138292992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODI5Mjk5Mg==","user":{"login":"tzolov","id":1351573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1351573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov","html_url":"https://github.com/tzolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-07T13:06:42Z","updated_at":"2015-09-07T13:06:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the update @corneadoug. I've faced the ace upgrade issue while preparing the (ZEPPELIN-216).  When i tried to upgrade ace to 1.2.0 the existing ui-ace version complained. I've managed to increase ui-ace but had to force some dependency resolutions and was not confident it will not cause side effects. So i upgraded ace to safest ace 1.1.9 version instead. But if you manage to upgrade ui-ace (very outdated it seems) it will allow us upgrade ace-build as well. \nAlso i would still love to learn how to write angular controller unit tests. \n\n@Leemoonsoo , @felixcheung it seems that this PR (e.g. ZEPPELIN-219) is ready to merge.\nThe tests will come after the ui-ace upgrade.
