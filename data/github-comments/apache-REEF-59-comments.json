Thanks, I have done another pass and left some comments in the code.\n\nMore broadly speaking, my main concern is that the API _seems_ to be restricted to combinations of the local runtime with YARN or HDI. Maybe I am wrong on that. If not: I don't see a hard reason for that restriction. If we can support any combo of runtimes, we should :)\n\nOn a similar note: This identifies a runtime with a `String` and that `String` is defined as a constant. This in turn means that each runtime can only be part of the multi runtime setup exactly once, right? Again, I don't think the design mandates that restriction. Can we lift it?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/191453826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/191458877","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/851#issuecomment-191458877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/851","id":191458877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTQ1ODg3Nw==","user":{"login":"shulmanb","id":519484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb","html_url":"https://github.com/shulmanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-02T22:20:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T22:20:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer Your first concern will be lifted once we will implement proper support for Mesos and other runtimes. I don't want to implement it right now (as I can't really test it) but we should create a Jira for it. IN general we will need to support all runtimes but I prefer to release it with partial support and add support in the future. WDYT?\n\nI can see why we would want to support several yarn environmens but for now it won't really work right? As we depend on the local configuration. I don't see any reason to support several local environments for example. IN order to support it we will need to introduce user provided identifier for each runtime which is possible and pass this identifier to the actual runtime so it could be attached to the allocated evaluators. This is all doable but as before I would prefer to release it with current limitations (I don't really see any usecases for these two) and have a JIRA for them.\n\nWDYT?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/191458877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/191482229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/851#issuecomment-191482229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/851","id":191482229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTQ4MjIyOQ==","user":{"login":"shulmanb","id":519484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb","html_url":"https://github.com/shulmanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shulmanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-02T23:00:27Z","updated_at":"2016-03-02T23:00:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markusweimer

I removed the `.VS2013.` files in the last commit. I believe the VS2015 files can be compiled from the command line via:\n\n```\nmsbuild .\\lang\\cs\\Org.Apache.REEF.sln /p:Configuration=\"Debug\" /p:Platform=\"x64\" /p:PlatformToolse\nt=v120 /m /tv:12.0\n```\n\nCan you give that a shot? Next step would be to somehow make VS 2013 call `msbuild` this way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/195599182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/195606441","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/873#issuecomment-195606441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/873","id":195606441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTYwNjQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"tcNickolas","id":10113024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTEzMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10113024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas","html_url":"https://github.com/tcNickolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcNickolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-11T23:52:38Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T23:52:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"These parameters seem to work for command-line set up for VS 2013, and this change works with normal build command for VS 2015 (both from command-line and VS itself).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/195606441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/comments/195606624","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/reef/pull/873#issuecomment-195606624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/reef/issues/873","id":195606624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTYwNjYyNA==","user":{"login":"markusweimer","id":502371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer","html_url":"https://github.com/markusweimer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusweimer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-11T23:53:17Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T23:53:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Yay!
