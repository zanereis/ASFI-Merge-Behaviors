This is an interesting PR/good idea.  I wonder though if this should just be a partitioning strategy in PartitionRecord.

Maybe then the name should be 'WeightedRecordDistribution'\r\n\r\nIn any case how about squashing the commits and rebasing to master and pushing the forced PR.  This will let the new CI processes run against the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/590111770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/590112749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4001#issuecomment-590112749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4001","id":590112749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDExMjc0OQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T20:32:43Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T20:32:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@gardellajuanpablo given #4002 and its having been merged can we close this one out?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/590112749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/590123514","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4072#issuecomment-590123514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4072","id":590123514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5MDEyMzUxNA==","user":{"login":"MikeThomsen","id":108184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeThomsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeThomsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-23T22:24:13Z","updated_at":"2020-02-23T22:24:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's been a few years since I last really used Solr, but the `commit()` there is a blocking call that forces a flush to the Lucene indexes and rewarms the \"searchers\" which are the Java objects that actually execute the queries.
