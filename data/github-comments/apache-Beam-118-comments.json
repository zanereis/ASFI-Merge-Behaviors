Tests backing this rely on `CreateStreamTest` which is Spark runner's equivalent of `TestStreamTest` in direct runner.\r\n2. `SparkTimerInternals` currently uses Spark's batchTime as the \"synchronized processing time\". \r\n3. This is implemented for `GroupByKey` without `Combine` optimizations - those should be easy enough to follow.\r\n4. This is not a full streaming support yet, and so `ROS` in streaming is not yet enabled - follow soon.
