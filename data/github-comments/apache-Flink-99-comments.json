This is a big addition! Are all the changes related to the clustering coefficient JIRA? Could it maybe be split into smaller PRs in order to make reviewing easier?\nFor big changes like this, it usually a good idea to create a design document to show the high-level approach and functionality to be added and discuss it with the community. Do you think it would make sense to do this?\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/210663735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/210709650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1896#issuecomment-210709650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1896","id":210709650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDcwOTY1MA==","user":{"login":"greghogan","id":569655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/569655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan","html_url":"https://github.com/greghogan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greghogan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-16T01:45:11Z","updated_at":"2016-04-16T01:45:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's certainly nicer to review small PRs, but I also like to present the big picture and context in which the features will be used.
