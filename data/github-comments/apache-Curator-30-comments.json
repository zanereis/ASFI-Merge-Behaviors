However, the bug fix necessitates that the shortcut described in <a href=\"http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#sc_doubleBarriers\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#sc_doubleBarriers</a> is removed (see also comment from 26/Aug/15 15:04). So more messages are exchanged now for the second barrier.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the question of Shiliang Cao:<br/>\nCurrently, some clients leave the second barrier early due to timeouts, they return false. And all remaining clients leave the second barrier only after all remaining clients have reached the second barrier, they return true.<br/>\nI guess the question of Shiliang Cao is whether all clients should return the same: All clients return false if at least one client has timed out, otherwise all clients return true.<br/>\nI think both options can make sense.</p>\n\n<p>Best regards, J D</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604728467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604728477","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/753#issuecomment-2604728477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/753","id":2604728477,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3Mjg0Nzc=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-16T16:43:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:24:24Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=Lianro\" class=\"user-hover\" rel=\"Lianro\">J D</a> - is the ZooKeeper recipe wrong?

follows. </p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>Client 0 watches any other node (and leaves the barrier if only he is left)</li>\n\t<li>All other clients watch client 0 (and leave the barrier if client 0 has left)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>So if you use the ZooKeeper recipe AND introduce a maximum wait time then:</p>\n<ul class=\"alternate\" type=\"square\">\n\t<li>If any other client than client 0 leaves after maxWaitMs, nothing bad happens and all remaining clients keep waiting</li>\n\t<li>But if client 0 leaves after maxWaitMs all other nodes leave together with client 0 (even if they do not have a maxWaitMs time limit and should keep waiting)</li>\n</ul>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604728484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/287250247","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/pull/206#issuecomment-287250247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/206","id":287250247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzI1MDI0Nw==","user":{"login":"oza","id":104111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDExMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza","html_url":"https://github.com/oza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-17T02:32:14Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T02:32:14Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Done

Curator could avoid telling users to do that dance above by continuing to support announcing ServiceInstances in their existing form, in their existing location, basically forever, but deprecating that form and location. Then create a new ServiceInstance2 that, from the start, has FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES <del>enabled</del> disabled. Add all new fields to that class and don't update ServiceInstance. With this approach, users don't have to upgrade clients through some specific version X first, but services do have to announce themselves using two different formats.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if there's a simpler way to get new fields added in a manner that avoids having to always upgrade clients first.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604755759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604755763","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/914#issuecomment-2604755763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/914","id":2604755763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NTU3NjM=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T18:42:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:35:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=gian\">gian</a>:</i>\n<p>(2) of those above two options is definitely the most user-friendly, although I am not familiar enough with how service discovery is implemented to know if it's going to work well on the service announcement side.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604755763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/comments/2604755770","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/curator/issues/914#issuecomment-2604755770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/curator/issues/914","id":2604755770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MDQ3NTU3NzA=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T19:59:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T13:35:08Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=randgalt\">randgalt</a>:</i>\n<p>I'd vote for <tt>ServiceInstance2</tt> as well.
