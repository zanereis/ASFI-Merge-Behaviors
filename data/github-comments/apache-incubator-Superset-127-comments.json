The question here is that when the query is eventually run on a slice, it still runs the full query. Or do we want to limit that too?\r\n\r\nAnother potentially separate idea is to respond early and display results on the frontend when the db has the first 1000 rows ready. (This can be known from the stats object returned from polling). THen rendering the rest when the user clicks to see all.\r\n\r\nWe will have to have an opinion on how superset should run queries and communiate that clearly in the interface so users, for example don't think the first 1K rows is all the results there is.
