sorry for the confusion -- if you look in `configuration.py` you'll see both a dictionary of defaults, the one you modified, and also a string template for `airflow.cfg`. You'll need to add your defaults in both places, preferably with comments in `airflow.cfg`. Also note that when you read the options, you'll want to use `getint()` instead of `get()` as appropriate, since they are stored as strings in airflow.cfg.
