Like I said before, the way I've implemented this, it seemed pretty trivial. Foremost, I needed this for something else and decided to take a shot at it. Missed the finer details, going by your comments.\nYou're right though. Back-tracking the execution graph will most certainly be a better solution. \n@StephanEwen , am I correct in assuming this functionality will be added after (or along with) Job Session management?\n\n[As for the memory issue though, if data is to be persisted across jobs, we'll always have to keep the memory segments allocated even after the job finishes. This is why I defined a separate owner, which can be later _garbage collected_ through a cache freeing mechanism.]\n\nAs far as merging it is considered, I wasn't sure myself from the beginning. I had actually written an email with a link to my branch for opinions, but ended up opening a PR instead of sending that. So no worries.

We can post another issue to JIRA and send PR for that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138890354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138890373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/671#issuecomment-138890373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/671","id":138890373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODg5MDM3Mw==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T12:14:44Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T12:14:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@aljoscha, is this PR still valid after the recent refactoring and extension of the streaming state interfaces?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138890373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/138894613","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/885#issuecomment-138894613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/885","id":138894613,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODg5NDYxMw==","user":{"login":"chiwanpark","id":1941681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDE2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1941681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark","html_url":"https://github.com/chiwanpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chiwanpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-09T12:28:53Z","updated_at":"2015-09-09T12:28:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think that using property in artifact id causes many problems.

Meanwhile, you can refer to the code in the existing pr https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1079. The code has passed the test in Travis CI and the hive test environment is quite simple to setup. One catch is that the hive junit tests is not thread safe, so you may need to tweak the surefire configuration to control the test concurrency.  The other catch is that the hcatalog jar from maven central only works in hadoop1 profile, please my discussion with @chiwanpark in that page

We observed that the object reuse mode does not work with all types, especially certain user-defined types that are serialized with Kryo. This is due to problems with empty instantiations and object-to-object copies. For that reason, we made the non-reusing mode the default, and the reusing mode optional.\n\nAll parts were one could not configure reuse/non-reuse were realized with non-reuse, to be on the safe side.\n\nTo keep this safe, I would like to use by default the non-reusing mode and the reusing mode when object reuse has been activated. For that, the reuse flag would have to be passed to the `UnilateralSortMerger`, and interpreted in the intermediate merge (line 1588ff).\n\nIf you could add this, it would be perfect and on the safe side.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/139276623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/139279212","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1066#issuecomment-139279212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1066","id":139279212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTI3OTIxMg==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T15:24:39Z","updated_at":"2015-09-10T15:24:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM, @tillrohrmann do you want to have another look as well?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/139279212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/139280931","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1116#issuecomment-139280931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1116","id":139280931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTI4MDkzMQ==","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T15:27:43Z","updated_at":"2015-09-10T15:27:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks a lot for adding the Javadocs to the class.
