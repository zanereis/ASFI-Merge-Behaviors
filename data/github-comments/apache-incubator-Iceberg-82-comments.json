Now it makes me wonder if this functionality will be compatible with later rewriting partitions table to use view of files table.  I guess it would be, as we should have an equivalent partition filter on files_table as well (partition.part_field = x, which is not there today).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/798797152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/798879208","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1413#issuecomment-798879208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1413","id":798879208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODg3OTIwOA==","user":{"login":"ggershinsky","id":12033212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDMzMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12033212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/ggershinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-14T09:56:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T09:56:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @shangxinli , I guess you are using a custom Parquet integration code. The way Iceberg calls the Parquet APIs today (in the master branch), doesn't allow for transparent activation of Parquet encryption via crypto factories. I had to make some code modifications in both writer and reader parts in order to have Iceberg create/query data tables with encrypted Parquet files.  Details TBD, but I believe they are not very important; this might be split into two phases - a near-term, that integrates the current Iceberg with Parquet encryption (one way or another), and a longer-term, that will depend on the progress of a bigger subject of the future approach to a general Iceberg/Parquet integration.\r\n\r\nAs a side note - all this is about the basic mechanics of the Iceberg/PME calls.

I think this is great to have the stats in the Hive table metadata. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think it'd still be good to implement `InputEstimator` in the `HiveIcebergStorageHandler` to provide the right estimation on the scan using the filter during a join plan. It's a bit tricky in Iceberg since we'd need to compute the split tasks again or cache them. I guess initially computing them again (if we can reuse the code) would be okay to avoid caching  - although it could be slow is it's a very selective scan, in that case maybe we could do a quick stop if too large and use table stats.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/799740810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/799796432","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2319#issuecomment-799796432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2319","id":799796432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5OTc5NjQzMg==","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-15T22:26:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T23:19:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdblue, I am afraid the changes done in Spark and whatever we have in our actions invalidate only cached data. I don't think we invalidate plans. For example, if someone creates a view that references a V2 table, Spark won't invalidate it.\r\n\r\nIn our `SparkTable`, we have `refreshEagerly` flag, which is set as true whenever the caching catalog is not used. Using the caching catalog without expiry, ensures the view will always be invalidated whenever there is an operation in the current session. Operations happening in other query engines won't invalidate the Spark view, though.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we should be able to handle this case by moving the caching/invalidation logic to `SparkTable`.

The failure  could be acceptable for batch jobs, I mean we could just fail the rewrite operation if someone write few new update/deletes into the base iceberg table, the batch update/deletes job is a rare operation, the probability of conflict between rewrite operation and update operation is small.   \r\n\r\nBut in streaming case, that is a different story.  Because the streaming job is always running and continues to commit the delta changes to iceberg table periodlly ( such as 1 minutes), the probability of conflict between rewrite operation and update operation is very large.  So failing the rewrite operation and re-do the whole expensive job is unacceptable for this case.  I'm trying to propose the solution that we don't have to re-do the rewrite operation,  the simplest way is following the current opportunistic concurrency control,  I mean the rewrite operation could just grab the table lock again and re-commit the generated files to iceberg table with the original sequence number from base snapshot, then the delete files will always effect the rewritten data files.  But it does not work for the position delete files because once we rewrite the data files then all of the row offset are changed, finally the delete files could not  be applied to the rewrite files.  Luckily,  we streaming update/upsert job won't produce any position delete files that delete the old data files,  so that should be OK.\r\n\r\n( btw,  I provided an unit test to demonstrate why the data semantics will be an issue if just try to reuse the files from rewrite operation here https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2303/commits/27e47a95d2761fa36d7724f8eac21b75b91f280c#diff-e573276c8dbbcd32f174f0e778334aeea106c67a19efabfefedf0afa4779a499R155-R218,  the [line](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2303/commits/27e47a95d2761fa36d7724f8eac21b75b91f280c#diff-e573276c8dbbcd32f174f0e778334aeea106c67a19efabfefedf0afa4779a499R217) will be broken because the rewrite action makes the `<2, B>` visible again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/800021752/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/800033927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/1413#issuecomment-800033927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/1413","id":800033927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDAzMzkyNw==","user":{"login":"ggershinsky","id":12033212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDMzMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12033212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/ggershinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggershinsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T07:46:09Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T07:46:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool, I'll send them in a pr (after the parquet-mr-1.12 artifact is released;

If we have an online server in front of those data files, then it's will be easy to guarantee the uniqueness because all of the write requests will be send to the same online server and the server could decide how to reject those duplicated write request, while for an iceberg table format it's hard to synchronize between different computation job. \r\n\r\nSo I'm fine to introduce the primary key without enforced uniqueness.  @jackye1995   Did you start this work in your repo ?

A similar hypothetical case is that if the rewrite only works for a given partition, and there is a positional delete that affects multiple partitions with a larger sequence number, or if the rewrite only works against files with sequence number up to N and there's an equality write with sequence number N + 1 then rewrite on the files that are pointed by this positional delete will break. \r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile I think this change does break the current assumption that the file is always written with the same sequence number as the commit/snapshot itself, and it might be possible that people are using file and manifest's sequence number to find out when they are introduced to the table, but now we are breaking this behavior. But I guess it might be fine since there are other more reliable sources like metadata tables that could help with the same information. I wonder if other people have thoughts on assumptions like this that could be break by this change. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/800782826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/800783133","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2010#issuecomment-800783133","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2010","id":800783133,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDc4MzEzMw==","user":{"login":"jackye1995","id":29823233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODIzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29823233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995","html_url":"https://github.com/jackye1995","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackye1995/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T04:24:01Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T04:24:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks for the reply! yup I have a version locally that I am working on, which includes changes similar to this PR without the uniqueness constraint.

You are trying to increase the seqNum of delete files that were written in the previous RowDelta when doing the rewrite action commit, I'm trying to commit the rewrite action with the stale seqNum that the table wrote before start the rewrite action. The key point is: Let the RowDelta's equality deletions could be applied to the following Rewriten data files. \r\n\r\nThe second appoach seems to be more simplier because we don't have to find all the delete files that was introduced by the previous RowDelta txn. we could just use the current sequence number as the newly introduced rewrite manifest's sequence number.\r\n\r\nAs I comment before, the equality write path don't introduce any position delete files that will be applied to the old files. So we don't have to fallback to re-do the whole rewrite action if conflicts happen. But for the batch row-level delete job, we will have to fallback to re-do the rewrite action because we have to re-evaluate the row set that are not deleted by the previous position deletion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/800847413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/800851402","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2308#issuecomment-800851402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2308","id":800851402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDg1MTQwMg==","user":{"login":"openinx","id":5028729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjg3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5028729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx","html_url":"https://github.com/openinx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openinx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T07:08:50Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T07:08:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"If we plan to maintain sequence number like that, then the semantic of sequence number will be:  if there are some real update/insert/delete in the table data set then we should increase the sequence number, otherwise we should keep the same sequence number for the rewrite action.

I think it's a reasonable approach to mark the rewritten files with the old seqNum, but I'm not sure if we necessarily need to use an old sequence number for the commit since they are stored as part of the snapshot, and suddenly have an old seqNum within the snapshot could be confusing even if there's no other implication.\r\n\r\n> the equality write path don't introduce any position delete files that will be applied to the old files.

I think we always want to do the check but just to not fail the commit unless there's positional deletes even for streaming systems, since it's possible that there could be separate concurrent jobs that do rewrites from equality to positional deletes? \r\n\r\nAnother thing that's worth noting is that there's a meeting about designing secondary index earlier today with the community, and when we discussed about rolling up secondary indexes to partition/global level (anything higher than file level index file), Anton @aokolnychyi brought up a point about using sequence number of the files to determine if a certain index file is current, or outdated. If we implement the change mentioned in this issue's proposal, we couldn't achieve that, since the data file path will be different after rewritten but the sequence number stays the same, and the system that builds index won't know that it has to update the index file which eventually will cause a discrepancy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/801330831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/801461121","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2328#issuecomment-801461121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2328","id":801461121,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMTQ2MTEyMQ==","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-17T21:40:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T21:40:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pvary Added in a variable for controlling the number of status check attempts as well as small 1 second timeout before the attempt.
