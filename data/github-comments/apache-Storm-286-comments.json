PRs to your fork or patches here? <br/>\nYour patch works well.  The duplicates and the activate/deactivate problems are not related to your patch as they are problems in KafkaSpout and the original Manual* subscription capabilities.  It looks like during KafkaSpout.shutdown() only the ack'd tuples are then committed back to Kafka but I believe that isn't accounting for other tuples in flight.  That fact might be by design for 'at least once' but I wonder if there is a way to wait for n seconds (based on topology kill time) to see if the remaining inflight tuples.  I don't recall the same duplicate behavior for in flight tuples when using storm-kafka but never looked for it specifically.  </p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2613015077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/315256976","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/2204#issuecomment-315256976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/2204","id":315256976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTI1Njk3Ng==","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-14T02:59:48Z","updated_at":"2017-07-14T03:02:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Applied recent change of logviewer and rebased.

What you are seeing looks to be because there are multiple SLF4J bindings on the classpath. Here is a brief description of the jars involved:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>slf4j-api - Pretty self-explanatory, this is the SLF4J API classes. There's no implementation included in this.</li>\n\t<li>log4j-sfl4j-impl-2.1 - This is the Log4j 2 binding to SLF4J. This causes logs via the SLF4J API to go to a Log4j 2 logger. These loggers are configured via the log4j2/worker.xml configuration file.</li>\n\t<li>log4j-over-slf4j-1.6.6 - This is the Log4j 1 bridge to SLF4j. This causes logs on the Log4j 1 API to go to SLF4J. The result of this file along with log4j-slf4j-impl-2.1 is that both SLF4j API and Log4j 1 API logs will go to the Log4j 2 API.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Then there are the other two files, log4j-api-2.1 and log4j-core-2.1, which contain the Log4j 2 API and implementation. </p>\n\n<p>Given this line</p>\n<div class=\"code panel\" style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent\">\n<pre class=\"code-java\">SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/tmp/356865dafc1a11e69341ecb1d7ac1510.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\n</pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>it looks like your topology jar contains a different SLF4J binding from log4j-sfl4j-impl-2.1. You should ensure that your topology jar doesn't depend on the following (not a complete list):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>slf4j-log4j12 - This is the Log4j 1 SLF4J binding.</li>\n\t<li>slf4j-simple - This is a simple stdout binding for SLF4J</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You may also want to check that your jar doesn't depend on log4j.jar, the Log4j1 implementation. log4j-over-slf4j-1.6.6 will provide classes that conflict with this.</p>\n\n<p>Finally you should set the jars provided by Storm to \"provided\" scope in Maven. You don't want your jar to contain classes that are also on the Storm classpath.

Theres nothing extra added to the underlying checkpointing mechanism itself and its pretty straightforward. \r\n\r\nThe tuples in window (think a FIFO queue) are split into multiple partitions so that they are more manageable and can be distributed/sharded via the underlying key-value state (redis/hbase etc). The modified partitions are saved during a checkpoint. During iteration the partition are loaded on demand from the underlying state backend as they are accessed. A subset of the partitions that are most likely to be used again are cached in memory.\r\n\r\nDuring checkpoint, the following are saved :\r\n1. Any modified or newly created window partitions.\r\n2.

State thats exposed to the user where the user may have saved some values.\r\n\r\nSince the KV state does not guarantee any specific ordering of the keys during iteration, a separate structure is maintained to store the ordered partition Ids which is used during iteration to retrieve the partitions in order.

Really appreciated.\r\n\r\n> 1. \"Prev\" \"First\" etc buttons seems to mix together. (On non-secure and secure cluster)\r\n\r\nLooks like failing to load css and also js file. We don't include static resource files to the class path, so you need to build binary distribution and use it to test correctly.\r\n(Please let me know if you tested it with binary distribution.)\r\n\r\nBtw, it seems to be by intention to avoid adding static resources to the client side. Maybe we can move static files to storm-webapp after porting UI and Logviewer is completed, since storm-webapp module is not intended to be used (as a dependency) for Storm client. It also helps to run and test Logviewer and UI with IDE.\r\n\r\n> 2. Got \"page not found\" while querying worker.log on secure cluster. The file actually exists.\r\n\r\nIf you could spend some time to help me debugging, could you check the file's permission? \r\n\r\n> 3. Got \"Request failed\" which querying dumps on secure cluster\r\n\r\nIs it occurred only from secure cluster? Looks like actual error is not relevant to secure, so just curious.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't have a chance to deploy the patch to secured cluster, since I feel there should be  no difference between non-secure and secure cluster. I might be wrong. I'll also spin secured cluster and test it again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/316212227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
