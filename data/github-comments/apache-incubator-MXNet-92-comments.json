However, this error did not prohibit me from doing work. I was trying to do some work about image at that time. This error told us that it could not create a file `bin/im2rec`, which was used to transform image to MXNet's own data format `record`. However, we do not need this. In the path `mxnet/tools/`, there exist two programs, namely `im2rec.cc` and `im2rec.py`. We could directly use `im2rec.py` to complete the work which should be done by `bin/im2rec`. Something like this:\n\n```\npython im2rec.py <source image's path> <the path to put record file>  <--resize=n>\n```\n\nHope this could make you feel better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233162731/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/233162912","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/2722#issuecomment-233162912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/2722","id":233162912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzE2MjkxMg==","user":{"login":"were","id":2356965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY5NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2356965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/were","html_url":"https://github.com/were","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/were/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-17T03:19:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T03:19:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@piiswrong
