If the second condition is not met, because a prior z.put(...) has not been executed for the same variable name, the original command including the {...} is left unchanged. Since the variable name used is expected to be meaningful, and is entirely under the end-user's control, it is always possible to avoid the need for escaping. Leaving the original command unchanged has other utilities as shown in the examples below. \r\n\r\n**Setup**\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq((1, \"one\"), (3, \"three\"), \r\n    (Int.MaxValue / 2, \"##\"), (Int.MaxValue, \"####\"))).toDF(\"id\", \"name\")\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"name\")\r\n\r\nz.put(\"n\", 3)\r\nz.put(\"table\", \"name\")\r\n```\r\n**Trivial Case**\r\nThe following SQL command works _normally_ -- performing variable substitution as expected.\r\n`%sql select * from {table} where id = {n}`\r\nThe output has one row: (3, three)\r\n\r\n**Unchanged Pattern-Like Construction**\r\nBut the following command also works -- with the pattern-like structure (which is actually a regex passed to _rlike_) left unchanged. \r\n`%sql select * from {table} where name rlike '#{2}'`\r\nThe output has 2 rows: (1073741823, ##) and (2147483647, ####)\r\n\r\nNote that allowing substitution patterns inside quotes is an advantage, giving us a string-interpolation facility like in Scala (and other languages). Again, escaping is not required here also as long as the content of {...} is judiciously chosen.\r\n\r\n**One Last Example**\r\nThe following example has two {...} structures, the first is part of a regex, the second is a real pattern.\r\n```\r\nz.put(\"what\", \"e\")\r\n%sql select * from {table} where name rlike '^.{3}{what}.$'\r\n```\r\nThe output has one row: (3, three)\r\n\r\nIncomplete patterns are also left unchanged, this could be an advantage for future embedded mini-languages in the same scope.\r\n\r\nWould like to hear your views on the this proposal to not implement escapes for embedded variable patterns. I only started looking at Zeppelin internals about 10 days back, so your insight will be very helpful.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/318258093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/318259011","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2326#issuecomment-318259011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2326","id":318259011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODI1OTAxMQ==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-27T05:01:05Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T05:01:05Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi

Zeppelin ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm does not explicity authentication the user using sAMAccountName but it does permit it.  It will also accept UPN.  In most cases, these match.

a little deeper to clarify the conflict ... The class `BaseZeppelinContext` uses two different key-value repositories for two different needs:\r\n\r\n1. **Storage of user-provided inputs entered into dynamic form fields**. These are held in an `AngularObjectRegistry` associated with the particular interpreter in effect, and are managed either (a) programmatically by the functions `z.angularBind(...)` and `z.angularUnbind(...)`, or (b) by using the `${ ... }` notation described at the link you provided (text-input-form) -- this second option is the one that seems to be (but in fact is not) in conflict with the substitution proposal described here.\r\n2. **Programmatically assigned data intended to be shared across interpreters** (currently Spark, R, and Python). These are held in a `ResourcePool`, and are managed by the functions `z.put(...)`, and `z.get(...)`. This pull request seeks to substitute values from a `ResourcePool` into `{ ... }` patterns in interpreter commands.\r\n\r\nSo, as described above, these are two different facilities, and use similar but different substitution patterns: the dynamic-forms facility uses `${ ... }` while this pull request (inter-interpreter data sharing facility) proposes to use `{ ... }` and `{{ ... }}` (for escaping the basic substitution pattern).\r\n\r\nThe Jupyter Python examples quoted ([this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3013418/28725977-878d2628-737c-11e7-85cf-8efd7336e724.png) and [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/28727529-c6ef6b1c-73e2-11e7-8ab3-7140f22f506a.png)) are drawn from the context of shell commands spawned by prefixing a command with `!` operator. In this case the { ... } pattern can be used to embed Python snippets (not just a variable name) into the command, and `{{ ... }}` is used for escaping the `{ ... }` substitution pattern. \r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies the two patterns and uses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/318911748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/318974026","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2510#issuecomment-318974026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2510","id":318974026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODk3NDAyNg==","user":{"login":"cloverhearts","id":10525473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts","html_url":"https://github.com/cloverhearts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T05:48:01Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T05:48:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"AWESOME!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/318974026/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/318975553","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2510#issuecomment-318975553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2510","id":318975553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODk3NTU1Mw==","user":{"login":"1ambda","id":4968473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda","html_url":"https://github.com/1ambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1ambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T05:59:27Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T05:59:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"CI failed, but irrelevant.
