I can't tell you with certainty that everything will work.

You'll then be able to check on your charts and dashboards in the new version to determine the best approach for your organization.

If the database setup did not finish successfully, that would explain the issue you're seeing. As a next step, here are some things to try:\r\n\r\nIf you're running Docker Desktop (e.g. if you're on a mac and not Linux), make sure that you have at least 6GB of RAM assigned to Docker.\r\n\r\nTry running `docker-compose down -rmi all -v` followed by `docker-compose up`. This will remove any linger containers and volumes and re-start the build from scratch. Please check the logs, especially from the `superset-init_1` container for any errors. I'm guessing that something about your setup is causing an error creating the proper database schema, and I'm hoping the issue will appear in those logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/596723191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/596723302","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9266#issuecomment-596723302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/9266","id":596723302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjcyMzMwMg==","user":{"login":"etr2460","id":7409244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7409244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460","html_url":"https://github.com/etr2460","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etr2460/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T19:00:15Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T19:00:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":":/ Could we clarify what's acceptable with one of our mentors?

My recommendation would be to restart your docker-compose setup to re-start the initialization process. If that doesn't work, try `docker-compose down -rmi -v` to remove all of the existing setup followed by another `docker-compose up`. Additionally, please ensure that Docker has 6 to 8 GB of RAM available if you're using Docker for Mac or a virtual machine. If you are able to post logs from the Docker process, or the error messages you run into during that process, that will help us debug the issue. Unfortunately web server logs are not useful in this case, as the issue is in the startup process.
