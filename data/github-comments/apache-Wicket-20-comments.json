While it is true that at the language level almost everything is nullable, in a typical project, the majority of values are never null.

I have created a branch using JSpecify: https://github.com/jstuyts/wicket/tree/add-non-null-to-parameters-jspecify\r\n\r\nThe advantages are:\r\n* It seems like the Java ecosystem is moving to JSpecify as the semantics are more precise and there is more tooling support.\r\n* The Kotlin compiler understands the annotations of JSpecify.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you decide you would like to use JSpecify instead of the Jakarta annotations.

I think the annotations should be added incrementally, and both annotations (nullable and not nullable) must be added. Once everything is annotated (which can take quite some time), the decision to switch to package-level (or some other level) annotations can be made. It is then also easy to determine which of the 2 annotations results in the least amount of code.

This may take a very long time to achieve. And may even be unsatisfactory: for some situations a client is guaranteed that the value will never be `null`, but as there are other situations where it can be `null` the variable or method has to be marked as nullable.\r\n\r\nSo the perfect state where you know exactly what is nullable will likely never be achieved. Even so, even adding nullable information to the most-used types of Wicket will greatly improve the developer experience. Yes, it is too bad that nobody took the time to add the annotations to less-used parts. And yes, it is unfortunate that a value is marked as nullable that will never be `null` because of the way you set things up.\r\n\r\nBoth issues can be solved: more effort by people who want to contribute, and new, more strict APIs and backward-incompatible changes to contracts of existing APIs (if acceptable for Wicket users).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion adding nullability information to even a small number of places, makes Wicket easier to use. This will hopefully help convince developers that Wicket still is a good choice for front end development.\r\n\r\nNote that knowing what is nullable is one of the reason I love working with Kotlin: no more going through incomplete documentation, and then through multiple layers of code to figure out whether or not I should handle `null`s. It saves me so much time. This time saving can also be (partially) realized for Wicket developers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/2640771837/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/2640826031","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/wicket/pull/1093#issuecomment-2640826031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/1093","id":2640826031,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAMmTM6dZ86v","user":{"login":"keesvandieren","id":863966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mzk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/863966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren","html_url":"https://github.com/keesvandieren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keesvandieren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-06T19:38:50Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T19:38:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"For seamless Kotlin integration, having proper @Nullable and @NotNull annotations is extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nWe're using Kotlin with Wicket, and one challenge we've encountered is the need to manually remove nullability when overriding methods.

thought about this some more over the weekend: It took me about 30 hours to fully annotate our ~350KLOC codebase by using the approach described above. Wicket is much smaller than that and we probably only need to annotate the most important packages in `wicket-core` and `wicket-request` to get immediate benefits for Kotlin users.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the following approach:\r\n\r\n1. Create a PR that adds JSpecify but does not annotate anything and merge it\r\n2. Create PRs that annotate a single package or a small group of packages with `@NullMarked` and `@Nullable`\r\n\r\nThat way individual PRs should be relatively small and easy to review and by using only `@Nullable` the noise should be kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIdeally, these changes would be driven by someone who actually uses Wicket with Kotlin and can verify the improvements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/comments/2647445512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
