  I have tried to do this, but  @SbloodyS  don't think it is a good way to deal with it. We can discuss together what is better,   There are some problems with this approach, which can only solve problems that are known to need to be thrown, but cannot be handled if an unknown exception occurs during startup\r\n\r\n我曾经尝试这样做，但是 SbloodyS 认为这样不是一个好的处理方式，我们可以一起再讨论一下怎么处理才更好；这种处理方式也确实存在一些问题，只能解决一些已知需要抛出异常的问题，但是假如启动过程发生了未知异常还是没办法处理\r\n\r\n#10433 \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20675095/174445906-1b3583ae-1de8-4a30-ae4c-9d3b063b32b6.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1159486788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1159492990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10413#issuecomment-1159492990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10413","id":1159492990,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5FHHV-","user":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-18T16:16:48Z","updated_at":"2022-06-18T16:16:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@guodongym \r\nYes, it just an example.\r\n\r\nYou need to find out if there is an undeamon thread is alive, the server hang when startup failure is due to the undeamon thread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1159492990/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/1159587687","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10120#issuecomment-1159587687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/10120","id":1159587687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOClTkms5FHedn","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-19T00:20:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-19T00:20:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity for 30 days.
