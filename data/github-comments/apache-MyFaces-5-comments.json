Given we use querySelectorall, the speed impact for doing this is neglectable.\r\n\r\nI will add a fix and improved unit tests for this issue tomorrow, and I will also test the final code against your testcase, to make it watertight.\r\n\r\nNot sure if a filter map really is the best way there because it ignores that a resource already might be on the dom once the first ajax call delivers a resource request, so you end up having a dom lookup to fix this. Then in a replace head or viewroot situation you have to clear the map anyway. So in the end you add additional bookkeeping and only gain a minor speed improvement in an area where speed is not critical anyway (how long des a querySelectorAll on the head take, probably not even measurable in nanoseconds).\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1301040923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1302330608","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1302330608","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1302330608,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5Nn_zw","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-03T16:01:34Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T16:03:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Short update... Still working on the issue. While fixing this one I noticed that script src elements in Ajax calls were loaded asynchronously thus causing race conditions for mixed script src and embedded script tags. Apparently a bug which we also have in the old implementation, but never reported. So I had to fix this area as well. The solution was to change the way we eval script src=\"xxx\" tags, i moved those also to the head appendix method which we already use for embedded scripts instead of running an xhr fetch request.\r\n\r\nI have the fix now running and all my eval tests pass, but I broke one of my nonce tests along the way with the new code (the final integration test fails which tests for one of the nonce corner conditions)\r\n\r\nSo I will fix this one as well, and after that run the code against the linked war.

Most tests are passing, but I see a few issues \r\n\r\n1)  f:param doesn't to be properly sent.  For example: \r\n\r\n```\r\n            <h:commandButton id=\"submitButton\" value=\"Click here\" action=\"#{elImplicitObjectBean.execute}\">\r\n                <f:param name=\"message\" value=\"Hello World\"/>\r\n            </h:commandButton>\r\n```\r\nThe code above sends the following in the form data: `0\t\"message,Hello+World\"`.  \r\n```\r\n0\t\"message,Hello+World\"\r\nform1_SUBMIT\t\"1\"\r\njakarta.faces.ViewState\t\"N2RjNThlYTRlZjExNjJiODAwMDAwMDAz\"\r\njakarta.faces.ClientWindow\t\"10tijvumt\"\r\nform1:_idcl\t\"form1:submitButton\"\r\n```\r\nHowever, previously (working case), `message\t\"Hello+World\"` was sent. \r\n```\r\nform1_SUBMIT\t\"1\"\r\njakarta.faces.ViewState\t\"ZjAyNTllMDgwODcxZTFlOTAwMDAwMDA0\"\r\njakarta.faces.ClientWindow\t\"-uveyxftzi\"\r\nmessage\t\"Hello+World\"\r\nform1:_idcl\t\"form1:submitButton\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes our app to fail since ExternalContext's getRequestParameterMap() cannot find \"message\". \r\n\r\n2)  Clicking \"Click Here\" on `ELImplicitObjectsViaCDI/index.xhtml` open up a new tab, but this shouldn't happen. See apps and source. \r\n\r\n\r\n3)  Our Websocket Listener's onOpen call is called during the page loading, but it should only occur on the button click.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"490\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5934310/200405665-cb383264-3a5c-44c8-9eae-47bee0c85f15.png\">\r\n\r\nURL is: `WebSocket/faces40/OpenCloseWebSocketTest.jsf` \r\n\r\n4)  Related to the websocket issue above, pressing the onClose button (to close websocket channel) encounter this exception: \r\n```\r\nUncaught TypeError: e.components[s].onclose is not a function\r\n    onclose http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    onclose http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    bindCallbacks http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    open http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    open http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    open http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    init http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    init http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces:2\r\n    <anonymous> http://localhost:9080/WebSocket/faces40/OpenCloseWebSocketTest.jsf:20\r\n```\r\n\r\n5)  Our html unit library is encoutnering a script exception? I don't don't see this in the browser, so I think it's just our library.  We'll try to see if it goes away with a version update.  I validated the JavaScript syntax myself (compressed and uncompressed files) and I didn't find anything. However, could you also double check?   Exception isn't clear where this \"error\" is. \r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.ScriptException: syntax error (http://localhost:8010/CDIManagedProperty/jakarta.faces.resource/faces.js.jsf?ln=jakarta.faces#2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSource code can be found: \r\nhttps://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/tree/integration/dev/com.ibm.ws.jsf.2.3_fat/test-applications/ELImplicitObjectsViaCDI.war\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/tree/integration/dev/com.ibm.ws.jsf.2.3_fat/test-applications/WebSocket.war\r\n\r\nBut I've also attached the apps. \r\n[Apps.zip](https://github.com/apache/myfaces/files/9955133/Apps.zip)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1306143241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1306168003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1306168003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1306168003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5N2orD","user":{"login":"volosied","id":5934310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied","html_url":"https://github.com/volosied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T20:46:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T20:46:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another thing I just noticed: The ajax file submissions (single / multiple) doesn't seem to work.  \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jakartaee/faces/tree/master/tck/faces40/inputFile  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1306168003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1306315248","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1306315248","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1306315248,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5N3Mnw","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-07T22:29:16Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T22:32:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the reports, I will tackle every single one of those issues tomorrow.\r\nthe f:param is clearly still an issue in the new form encoding code as for the rest I will have a deeper look.

level.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1307321421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1308394228","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/377#issuecomment-1308394228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/377","id":1308394228,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5N_IL0","user":{"login":"tandraschko","id":2485545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2485545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko","html_url":"https://github.com/tandraschko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:34:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:34:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1308394228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1308394538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/372#issuecomment-1308394538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/372","id":1308394538,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5N_IQq","user":{"login":"tandraschko","id":2485545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2485545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko","html_url":"https://github.com/tandraschko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:35:12Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:35:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1308394538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1308395377","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/371#issuecomment-1308395377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/371","id":1308395377,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5N_Idx","user":{"login":"tandraschko","id":2485545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2485545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko","html_url":"https://github.com/tandraschko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tandraschko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:35:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:35:53Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1308395377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes

After compiling the files down to es5 I get a more meaningful error in my internal testing framework that the keyword class (explicit classes were introduced in es2015) is not allowed.\r\nI checked on Mozillas site and found this:\r\nhttps://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html\r\n\r\nThere are two possible fixes to move forward\r\na) We can return to an ES5 compile target, which is rather pointless given the apis we use, and might run into compatibility issues with html unit anyway (we use FormData elements XhrObject, querySelectorAll etc... which are APIs which might not exist on ES5 level browser implementations)\r\nBut nevertheless it is worth a shot, but my hopes are somewhat limited. In my opinion HTML Unit is outdated, unless they fix their Rhino problem. There are alternatives.\r\n\r\nb) You guys can have a look to get the unit tests out of this ES5 level maybe move the tests to Selenium where you can use different drivers or move to a client side testing framework. I know this is a little but much to ask. But as it seems HTMLUnit for now as testrunner seems to be a dead end as long as it uses Rhino and/or Rhino does not move forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nA viable option for a testing with a more recent engine would be to use Selenium Webdrivers with headless chrome\r\n(you need to have a chrome instance preinstalled in the testing environment though)\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/werpu/5f212b8c6ee8864cbfdceec8bbff226b\r\n\r\nGives you the idea how to pull this off.\r\n\r\nAnd the configuration for it would be:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/werpu/94f4a74007ac6efae9561e111e216b42\r\n\r\nSo you get the idea... \r\n\r\nBasically the same as html unit but with chrome as engine (headless) or firefox etc... in non headless mode.\r\n\r\nThis then can be combined by the usual means into tests.

Acceptable *name/value* pair options are!\r\nYou get the idea... we could nudge here our boundaries a little bit, but every code passing it as nested array and not a will break the RI (almost 100% sure of that)\r\n\r\nVery likely neither would:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\njsf.ajax.request(... {render: \"render ids\". params: [[\"param1\", \"value1\"],  [\"param2\", \"value2\"]})\r\n``` \r\n\r\nwork on the RI as stated above.\r\n\r\nAlthough will supporting it with the next update, because the spec leaves it open and we can nudge here a little bit.\r\n\r\nSo if your test uses a pattern like one of the two being passed into the ajax request cycle, the RI clearly would break on both cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother note:\r\n\r\nBy stepping over the docs I noticed a bug which we have been carrying around for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe spec jsdoc states, that passthrough parameters must be put under the key *params*,\r\nin our original code however we do not do that, and that was carried over.\r\n(my fault i programmed this back then) we used whatever was not in a reserved keyword as passthrough value.\r\n\r\nSo I have to fix this, but have also (with a deprecation notice) carry the non spec conform, old behavior along\r\nwhere we just pass anything not being within the context of the reserved keys like render as passthrough parameter.\r\nThis is the offiending code in our original impl:\r\n\r\n```Ecmascript\r\n        /*\r\n         * We make a copy of our options because\r\n         * we should not touch the incoming params!\r\n         * this copy is also the pass through parameters\r\n         * which are sent down our request\r\n         */\r\n        var passThrgh = _Lang.mixMaps({}, options, true, this._BLOCKFILTER);\r\n        //the blockfilter is a list of reserved keys not being usable as params\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will go in as well with my fix. I will allow both patterns until it is clear that removing our old non spec behavior does not break anything.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1311285354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1311425893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1311425893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1311425893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5OKsVl","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-11T09:09:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T09:12:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Also I tested the file upload and the single upload via ajax is working now.

Because the RI definitely will break on such a construct.\r\n(I can take it out again, if not wanted, it is just 3 loc and a test)\r\n\r\nThis leaves as last issue the HTMLUnit issue, I will look at this on monday by shifting our build to ES5 and then see whether a simple request passes in HTMLUnit, if that one fails, I will have to challenge the TCK to use a more modern testing framework as second option at least.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1311626485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1311973354","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1311973354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1311973354,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5OMx_q","user":{"login":"volosied","id":5934310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied","html_url":"https://github.com/volosied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-11T17:28:01Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T17:28:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"File uploads look good! \r\n```\r\n    field: multipleSelection, name: test2.txt, size: 13\r\n    field: multipleSelection, name: test1.txt, size: 13\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe f:param still isn't working for me...?

return false;\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nI now checked the old code on our oamsubmit, there is a deviation in the implementation, so the bug is on my side on the javascript side.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n if ((typeof params != 'undefined') && params != null) {\r\n                for (var i = 0, param; (param = params[i]); i++) {\r\n                    myfaces.oam.setHiddenInput(formName, param[0], param[1]);\r\n                }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWheras new:\r\n```typescript\r\nStream.ofAssoc(params).each((param: [string, any]) => {\r\n            myfaces.oam.setHiddenInput(formName, param[0], param[1]);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nHowever the incoming parameters are not an associative array but an array.\r\nThis will be fixed.\r\nMakes sense on the oamsubmit side to support both formats!\r\nSo that we can pass either Tuples, or an Associative Array.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1313201984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1313725724","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1313725724","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1313725724,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5OTd0c","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T13:37:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T14:53:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"OamSubmit now is fixed, should work as expected, I am now covering both methods of parameters and added 5 new Unit Tests to cover this api. You now can either pass tuples or associative arrays:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356/commits/4545045fa901d42bc862d7546e281ebf7d9adac3#diff-b7998247c1ec37ef6a46d490efa49d3b385ea436fc765ab3dd02f68485aab44b\r\n\r\nYou get the idea from the newly added tests!\r\n@volosied let me know if this fixes your last remaining issue, without having to patch the ButtonRenderer!\r\n\r\nAddition: I just did a preliminary test against HTMLUnit with an es5 compiled version of our scripts. As expected HTMLUnit chokes, it throws in this case an error on perfectly valid code which is even es5. So it is not even the Dom it has started to choke on.\r\nThe best bet would be to challenge the TCK in this area to use a better engine for client side testing. It wont brake the RI codebase by for instance moving to webdrivers but would help us a lot.\r\n\r\nI just had a look at the ajax parts of the TCK, it should be portable, not sure how many tests 30-40 I think, but most of them should be a straight port forward. The problem is I am not sure whether I am allowed to do this porting, given the ties I have to the Apache code and its more liberal license.\r\n\r\nThe main culprit is the usage of html unit, I will do a port of those tests tomorrow against selenium webdriver and will open a ticket/pull request and then lets see what they say about it. I guess we have a higher chance to get this changed if we spare them the work of doing it themselves.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1313725724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1314345459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1314345459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1314345459,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5OV1Hz","user":{"login":"volosied","id":5934310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied","html_url":"https://github.com/volosied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T20:33:13Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T20:33:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@werpu  Thank you for getting the array issue fixed!

short update, I got the two tck bugs in, have not had time to fix them today, I will fix them probably tomorrow. As I am busy atm porting the TCK tests to Webdriver. I have now about 70% of the mojarra JSF 2.2 TCK tests ported and have solved all missing pieces which HTMLUnit had but webdriver does not (aka request response data is not exposed by WebDriver, but you can solve it over the Chrome debugging engine) \r\nSo I am making good progress, to get the TCKs updated. I probably will have a pull request on the jakarta side ready sometime next week.\r\n\r\nReedit: I would love to postpone the fixes until I have the TCK ported, if anyone has objections I will do them tomorrow otherwise sometimes next week.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1318783645/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1318821908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/385#issuecomment-1318821908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/385","id":1318821908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5Om6AU","user":{"login":"volosied","id":5934310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied","html_url":"https://github.com/volosied","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/volosied/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-17T15:39:22Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T15:39:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hey Thomas, I see you had commented in the original issue here: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/issues/4957#issuecomment-996785168 \r\n\r\nYou mentioned the viewstate size might be an issue here (and the fact this behavior isn't strictly necessary)?

tests.\r\nWill run the same against the old codebase later on.\r\n\r\n**2041**: TCK issue, there is no ajax code executed despite being in the tck ajax section, the error lies within my test framework\r\nwhere the updated page is not evaluated because a url change is performed instead of just a content change.\r\n(full post update). \r\nIssue now fixed on my side, by updating my selenium based testing framework.\r\n\r\n**Issue2179IT**: Definitely an implementation issue, a simple page get does not trigger the encodeAll of the underlying error throwing component in the TCK.\r\nWill file a bugreport later. Test is not fixable on my side, but the the java part is at fault here.\r\n\r\n**Issue 2439**: Fails for several reasons:\r\na) the test searches for RI specific apis (mojarra.ab) in its result analysis.\r\nThis needs to be challenged.\r\n\r\nb) We have a bug in our impl, a dual f:ajax does not seem to overwrite the previous one\r\naka the first f:ajax removes an onchange handler in the final result\r\nthe second one should reenable it again, but does not.\r\nI will file a bug on this one later! (the test explicitely tests for such cases)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <h:inputText id=\"input2\">\r\n\t  <f:ajax execute=\"@all\" render=\"@all\" disabled=\"true\"/>\r\n          <f:ajax execute=\"@this\" render=\"@all\"/>\r\n   </h:inputText>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Issue2906IT**: Tag html seems to be missing in the myfaces taglib:\r\nh:html is not working and produces an error (Impl Problem)\r\nAfter fixing that in the source to html, test works. MyFaces bugreport\r\nwill be added.\r\n\r\n**Issue2674IT**: Again Test is faulty here testing for specific mojarra.ab patterns instead of \r\ndoing a more generic test\r\n\r\n**Issue2906IT**: Again impl issue, &amp;nbsp; seems to be swallowed or mangled instead of being passed through, after the initial http get, test fails because it checks explicitly for rendered whitespaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue3097IT**: ViewExpired exception is appended twice to the error listener, and string class is missing in front of\r\njakarta.faces.ViewExpiredException.\r\nThis is definitely at least partially a client side issue. Will be fixed.\r\nthe response protocol shows: \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<partial-response>\r\n    <error>\r\n         <error-name>jakarta.faces.application.ViewExpiredException</error-name>\r\n         <error-message><![CDATA[View \"/viewExpired1.xhtml\" could not be restored.]]></error-message>\r\n    </error>\r\n</partial-response>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting for class in front of jakarta.faces.application.ViewExpiredException is questionable at best, it probably should not be tested especially given it is not very likely part of the spec.\r\nHaving the error being appended twice due to the listener being called twice is definitely on my plate. I will cover this with a unit test.\r\n\r\nMyFaces in my opinion is correct. The error handler is only called once, but given we have an embedded script with an addOnError, hit is added twice and triggered twice.\r\nNow we have two options... we could clear the listeners before evaluating embedded javascripts again.\r\nOr we simply let the user deal with it.\r\nBut in any case the jsf code is static even after a render all, so basically having the user deal with this is probably better\r\nwe have a local error handling anyway on request level.\r\nSo the only issue, which remains, is that the class is missing in front of the error name, but thats a non issue in my opinion or maybe even an RI bug!\r\nI will file a bug on the RI side for this one!\r\n\r\n**Issue3473IT**: \r\nExpected: Error from form:commandButton\r\nResult: Error from undefined\r\n\r\nWe clearly have a deviation here which needs to be fixed on the client side.\r\nFixed in the downstream code... the source was not passed down as element like the\r\ntext expects it to be.\r\n\r\n-merged already into the pull request\r\n\r\n**Issue3833IT**:\r\n\r\nThe test fails on the third selection, something is problematic in the viewstate handling, but definitely not the client.\r\nThe viewstate is passed correctly down and returned\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<partial-response id=\"j_id__v_0\">\r\n    <changes>\r\n        <update id=\"form:message\"><![CDATA[\r\n            <div id=\"form:message\">null -&gt;

How did you get it set up to run against MyFaces? I'm curious as my team's only option is testing through Open-Liberty's faces-4.0 feature.\r\n\r\nDid your tests use htmlunit or the Selenium?\r\n\r\nWhich version of the TCK did you use? 4.0.1 or the main branch? We've made numerous challenges so far, and a few of the tests have already been updated (particularly - removing Mojarra specific checks, such as [Issue2674IT](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/commit/069d2c9b190892af984e59b83d2f8ccd0b61599f)).\r\n\r\nLastly, one issue in the list that I noticed is [Issue2439IT#testDisabledBehaviors](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/blob/master/tck/faces22/ajax/src/test/java/ee/jakarta/tck/faces/test/servlet30/ajax/Issue2439IT.java#L43). I had spent some time looking at it previously (but haven't made any jira yet) and I agree it's a Java-side issue.  We don't register the handler at all due to the return on this line: https://github.com/apache/myfaces/blob/main/impl/src/main/java/org/apache/myfaces/view/facelets/tag/faces/core/AjaxHandler.java#L391  I removed the return and test still failed because it rendered `onchange=\"\"`.  We'd have to include a empty string check to avoid writing on change. Maybe there's another way to fix it.  Also, the comment just above the return refers to the example below in the JSF 2.0 spec.  Our impl thinks one is an inner and the other an outer handler. \r\n```\r\n“For this example, the inner <f:ajax/> would apply to “button1”. The outer (wrapping) <f:ajax> would not be applied, since it is the same type of submitting behavior (AjaxBehavior) and the same event type (action).  For this example, since the event types are the same, the inner <f:ajax> event overrides the outer one.”\r\n\r\n<f:ajax event=”click”>\r\n   <h:inputText id=”text1”>\r\n      <f:ajax event=”click”/>\r\n   </h:inputText>\r\n</f:ajax>\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we should challenge this test or try to fix our implementation?  Firstly, Issue2439IT was created due to a syntax error.  Secondly, does it make sense to have two f:ajax tags for h:inputText for the same on change event?  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1337745728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/comments/1337899980","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/myfaces/pull/356#issuecomment-1337899980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/myfaces/issues/356","id":1337899980,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB-dSOs5PvrvM","user":{"login":"werpu","id":530547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu","html_url":"https://github.com/werpu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werpu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-05T18:22:25Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T18:31:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi I forked away the TCK codebase and use Selenium as test base for it running an Embedded Tomcat (the original code uses HTMLUnit and Glassfish) - I already have shared a pull request with Selenium Webdriver ports of the tests into the TCK.\r\n\r\nAs for the embedded Tomcat, I atm have not shared the fork yet on github, but, I will open a Github project tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI atm use the 4.0x branch and the new scripts for testing, the fork, is only for the Ajax parts of the TCK. \r\n\r\nI wanted originally to share it once I have ported all tests over and have fixed everything which I encounter on my side, but I can share the fork if wanted earlier so that you guys can pick it up. \r\n\r\nThe other reason why I have not shared it yet is, that i still have a small problem when starting the tests from the main project, once the tests switch over from one project to another I run into the issue, that the embedded tomcat is not properly shut down, but it works fine as long as you start from a submoudle (jsf22 ajax for instance)\r\n\r\nBut again if the need is there to get your hands on it, then I will open a github public repo for it tomorrow.\r\n\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure if we should challenge this test or try to fix our implementation?
