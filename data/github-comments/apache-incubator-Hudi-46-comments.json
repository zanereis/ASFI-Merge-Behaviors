Create a kafka topic(don't produce any data to kafka) which means a topic with no messages, then start the delta streamer, hudi will store the empty checkpoint.\r\n\r\n2. Set `auto.offset.reset=latest` and use a new target-base-path. like #1375 says.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/595787065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/595861325","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1355#issuecomment-595861325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1355","id":595861325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTg2MTMyNQ==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T16:57:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T16:57:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@satishkotha I feel we can table this PR for now, once we have a concrete plan on cleaner files being limited, lets discuss this PR at that time, moving to WIP for now..","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/595861325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/595880550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1373#issuecomment-595880550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1373","id":595880550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTg4MDU1MA==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T17:40:22Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T17:40:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lamber-ken yes.. it seems like an interplay issue...

I need a robust way to generate the checkpoint from kafka-connect-hdfs managed files and kafka-connect itself sometimes having an issue to retrieve checkpoint when the Kafka partition number was large. The mechanism is to scan every single file and get the latest checkpoint of each Kafka partition.

Good call.. Did not think of this angle, that it might be confusing to have the same bundle name represent something totally different . lets delay this for a later release. \r\nthanks @lamber-ken , as always!

`filesystem` is shared with same uri, \r\nor please check `org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem`\r\n\r\n```\r\nverifyChecksum: false\r\nfs1 hashcode: 1288235781\r\nfs2 hashcode:

fs1.hashCode());\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 6:** why ci build failure after code cleanup?\r\n\r\nwe know junit executes in alphabetical order, so after cleanup, ci failure\r\n\r\nprev \r\n- TestHBaseQPSResourceAllocator\r\n- TestUpdateMapFunction\r\n\r\nnow\r\n- TestHBaseQPSResourceAllocator\r\n- TestUpdateSchemaEvolution\r\n\r\n**Step 7:** Why junit doesn't report failure in local env?\r\n\r\nBecause we just test `TestUpdateSchemaEvolution`, the `verifyChecksum` doesn't be modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/596656326/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/596729630","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1362#issuecomment-596729630","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1362","id":596729630,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjcyOTYzMA==","user":{"login":"garyli1019","id":23007841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDA3ODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23007841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019","html_url":"https://github.com/garyli1019","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyli1019/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T19:13:55Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T19:13:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@vinothchandar @pratyakshsharma Agree that running non-delta streamer commit to fix the data gap sounds a bit hacky. I think I can get the checkpoint from previous commit myself and pass it to the delta streamer as the `checkpoint` would serve the same purpose of this PR.  \r\n\r\nThe ideal migration process for my use case would be:\r\n- Do the initial bulk inset from reading DFS parquet source managed by Kafka-connect, the naming convention of the parquet files: `topicname+partition1+offsetLowerbound+offsetUpperbound.parquet`\r\n- Generate the delta streamer checkpoint from those parquet files: `{partition1: offsetUpperbound, ...}`\r\n- Start the delta streamer from the checkpoint\r\nI think the tool to generate the checkpoint for the user would make the migration seamless. Will look into how to implement this.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the hint on the Kafka API :) One edge case would stop me using it is that a kafka-connector stuck for one partition and other partitions are fine, if I pick a timestamp not earlier than the stuck partition, then I might lose some messages there.  \r\n\r\nOnce I figure out the `offsetGenerator` tool I will update this PR.
