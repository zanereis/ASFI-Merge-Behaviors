Kafka supervisor has been reworked and includes the following refinements:\n- Task lifetime is now based on time rather than a number of ingested events - as @himanshug pointed out, this is easier for users to reason about and better handles fluctuating ingestion rates (or even situations where no events are ingested at all in a time period)\n- 1 from above (subsequent tasks are started immediately instead of waiting until the previous set has finished publishing)\n- 2 from above (tasks stopped by the supervisor report a SUCCESS status with log messages in the task showing that it was asked to stop early)\n- 3 from above (supervisor specs are persisted in metadata storage and will automatically load and begin running when the overlord starts (or takes leadership)\n- 5 from above (KafkaIndexTasks can be stopped early and instructed to publish - telling the supervisor to shutdown via the HTTP API will cause a controlled (synchronized across replicas) early publish and shutdown of the managed tasks)\n- 6 from above (on startup, supervisor now inspects and adopts already-running tasks that match the supervisor's spec and expected start offset)\n\nThe supervisor logic has changed somewhat from the above description to accommodate time-based task lifetimes and no pauses between tasks. I'll post an updated overview of the mechanism, but as is this PR should be ready for review.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/213197973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/213245995","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2716#issuecomment-213245995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2716","id":213245995,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzI0NTk5NQ==","user":{"login":"sirpkt","id":4968993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-22T04:26:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T04:26:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@b-slim

With the updated design, the user provides a `taskDuration` value in the supervisor spec which is used to manage the lifetime of tasks based on time rather than starting and ending offsets. The high-level mechanism works as follows:\n1. When the supervisor starts up, assuming no tasks are already running, it will create up to `taskCount` \\* `replicas` number of tasks. Each of these tasks will be provided with a start offset per partition corresponding to the last offset that was read and published in a segment (from the dataSource metadata table) or if this doesn't exist, either the earliest or latest offset from Kafka depending on configuration. The **end offset** is now always set to Long.MAX_VALUE. This is because we can't know how many events we will be reading during `taskDuration` so we initially set the tasks to read indefinitely.\n2. Once the task is accepted by a worker and is started, the supervisor queries the task for its starting time and stores this information. It schedules an event to fire at `startTime` + `taskDuration`.\n3. When the event is fired, the supervisor then executes the logic to instruct the tasks to end reading and begin publishing their segments in a coordinated way. Coordination is important, because if we just told the tasks to stop and publish, replica tasks which are expected to have read the same data and publish exactly the same segments are not guaranteed to produce identical segments since the Kafka consumers might be at different offsets for different partitions when they receive the stop command. To coordinate the tasks, we do the following:\n   \n   a. Tell all tasks handling a particular set of partitions (in the code referred to as a task group) to pause and return the offsets it had read up to before it was paused.\n   \n   b. Build a list of the highest offset for each partition read by any of the tasks.\n   \n   c. Tell all of the tasks to change their ending offset from Long.MAX_VALUE to the list generated in step b. Using the highest offset (and not for example the highest offset + 1) guarantees that all the data is available in Kafka (since at least one of the tasks has already read it) and that the tasks will always be able to complete.\n   \n   d. Tell all of the tasks to resume reading.\n   \n   The tasks will then all read to the same ending offset for every partition and begin publishing their segment.\n4. The supervisor will then immediately create tasks to continue reading from Kafka starting from the ending offsets determined in step 3. This will allow for continuous ingestion from Kafka (with a few seconds of delay as the new task is accepted by a worker and starts up). At the same time, the previous tasks which are now publishing are moved to a list of 'pending completion' tasks and assigned a timeout specified by the `completionTimeout` config.\n5. If a task which is supposed to be publishing does not finish before the timeout, the task is deemed to have failed and is terminated. Furthermore, segments generated by KafkaIndexTasks must contain contiguous offsets, so a failure to publish by a previous task means that the next tasks that were reading from the same partitions are now invalid. The supervisor handles this by killing the tasks reading those partitions and then re-creating new tasks that start from the last successfully published offset (tracked in the dataSource table).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/214509351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/214509793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2867#issuecomment-214509793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2867","id":214509793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDUwOTc5Mw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T20:25:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T20:25:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"👍\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/214509793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/214515284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2867#issuecomment-214515284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2867","id":214515284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDUxNTI4NA==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T20:43:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T20:43:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@javasoze do you mind signing the CLA?
