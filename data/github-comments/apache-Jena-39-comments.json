It worked with no issues. I tried again later and then it got really slow to load, but no console errors (maybe server under maintenance or slow latency to reach me here in Barcelona?)\r\n\r\nI refreshed the page (in private browsing) and then it loaded it quite quickly, with no errors.\r\n\r\n@SimonBin any chance that:\r\n\r\n1. you are on a VPN when accessing it?\r\n2. your server has a reverse proxy filtering the requests?\r\n\r\nMaybe you could try starting an instance with Jena running in Eclipse/IntelliJ, or directly from the command-line after downloading the zip/tar.gz archive. And then start a local instance of your coypu.org app pointing to your local Jena (or maybe simulate it somehow).\r\n\r\nIt could be an issue as you pointed in Vite or Vue.
