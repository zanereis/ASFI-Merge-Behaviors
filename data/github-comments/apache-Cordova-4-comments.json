Basically, I just started with a simple `cordova create`.\r\nHere is the package.json I am using:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"cordova\": \"^9.0.0\",\r\n    \"cordova-android\": \"^8.0.0\",\r\n    \"cordova-plugin-geolocation\": \"4.0.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cordova\": {\r\n    \"plugins\": {\r\n      \"cordova-plugin-geolocation\": {}\r\n    },\r\n    \"platforms\": [\r\n      \"android\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the config.xml:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\r\n<widget id=\"io.cordova.hellocordova\" version=\"1.0.0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\" xmlns:cdv=\"http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\">\r\n    <name>HelloCordova</name>\r\n    <description>Hello</description>\r\n    <author email=\"dev@cordova.apache.org\" href=\"http://cordova.io\">hello</author>\r\n    <content src=\"index.html\" />\r\n    <access origin=\"*\" />\r\n    <allow-intent href=\"http://*/*\" />\r\n    <allow-intent href=\"https://*/*\" />\r\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-geolocation\" spec=\"4.0.1\" />\r\n    <platform name=\"android\">\r\n        <allow-intent href=\"market:*\" />\r\n        <!-- <config-file parent=\"/*\" target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\">\r\n            <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\r\n        </config-file> -->\r\n    </platform>\r\n    <engine name=\"android\" spec=\"^7.1.4\" />\r\n</widget>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you leave that line commented out and run an `npx cordova prepare`, you will see that the generated `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` will have the proper location permissions:\r\n```\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\" />\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" />\r\n<uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.location.gps\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you uncomment the lines in the config.xml, however, and re-run your `npx cordova prepare`, it will remove those permissions.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that I do see the following warning on prepare:\r\n```\r\nConflict found, edit-config changes from config.xml will overwrite plugin.xml changes\r\n```\r\nHowever, I have always seen that warning, so I thought nothing of it when upgrading to Cordova 9.  Using Cordova 8, I saw that warning, but it still had all of the permissions in the AndroidManifest file.  It may very well be that I should be requesting camera permission in a different way than what I am attempting to do here, because it is clearly not allowing both the way I am specifying and the way the plugin wants to use.

The actual changes (manifest \"corruption\") consisted in removing several **uses-permission** and **uses-features** tags from the initially correct manifest:\r\n```xml \r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.FLASHLIGHT\" />\r\n    <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera\" android:required=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\nAfter digging a lot to find a solution to avoid this annoying behavior, I ended up with a final work-around where I used a Cordova hook for **before_prepare** & **after_prepare** that will backup & restore the correct manifest. \r\n\r\nUntil an official fix/update will be provided, here is the hook that I've implemented, hoping to be useful for others encountering this bug. \r\nPlease note the hook (to be removed when the bug is fixed!) is implemented into a single JavaScript file (**hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js**) covering both events being registered under **config.xml** as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<hook type=\"before_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n<hook type=\"after_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow I included the relevant **hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js** JavaScript code that will backup & restore the manifest where the new created files (**AndroidManifest.xml.good** + **AndroidManifest.xml.bad**) are saved directly under **app** root folder (outside the **src** path) to avoid being included into Android app build processing.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\n/* eslint-env node */\r\nvar fs = require(\"fs\"),\r\n\tutils = require(\"./utils\"),\r\n\tcolors = utils.colors,\r\n\tlog = utils.log;\r\n\r\n//

See the snippets below:\r\n\r\n**config.xml** updates:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<hook type=\"before_build\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n<hook type=\"before_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n<hook type=\"after_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/> \r\n```\r\n**android_manifest_fixer.js** updates:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\n/* eslint-env node */\r\nvar fs = require(\"fs\"),\r\n\tcolors = require(\"chalk\"),\r\n\tlog = console.log,\r\n\tinBuildPhase = false; \r\n\r\n// hook function\r\nfunction

function(source, dest) {\r\n\t\t\twrite(dest, read(source));\r\n\t\t};\r\n\tif (!inBuildPhase) { // enable the fixed just in build \r\n\t \tif  (context.hook === \"before_build\") {\r\n\t\t\t// flag the build phase\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Enter build phase, enable the fixer!\");\r\n\t\t\tinBuildPhase = true\r\n\t \t}\r\n\t} else if (context.hook === \"before_prepare\") {\r\n\t\t// backup the manifest\r\n\t\tlog(\"Backup 'AndroidManifest.xml' as \" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));\r\n\t\tcopy(manifestPath, manifestPathGood);\r\n\t} else if (context.hook === \"after_prepare\") {\r\n\t\tvar manifestText = read(manifestPath),\r\n\t\t\tmanifestTextGood = read(manifestPathGood),\r\n\t\t\tmanifestPathBad = \"./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.bad\";\r\n\t\t// check if the the manifest was changed during preparation\r\n\t\tif (manifestText !== manifestTextGood) {\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Save corrupted 'AndroidManifest.xml' under \" +\tcolors.yellow(manifestPathBad));\r\n\t\t\twrite(manifestPathBad, manifestText);\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Restore 'AndroidManifest.xml' from \" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));\r\n\t\t\twrite(manifestPath, manifestTextGood);\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"The AndroidManifest.xml is not modified during prepare \" + colors.red(\" -> The 'android_manifest_fixer' hook is NOT needed anymore !\"));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// export hook function\r\nmodule.exports = hook;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the manifest corruption is happening just during pre-build prepare , I hope this enhanced handling will better isolate the problem and preserve the proper manifest.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/489964157/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/comments/490066634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/121#issuecomment-490066634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cordova/issues/121","id":490066634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDA2NjYzNA==","user":{"login":"f5cs","id":36580364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTgwMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36580364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs","html_url":"https://github.com/f5cs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f5cs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-07T12:53:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T12:53:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Have

Sorry, I might have misunderstood you earlier.\r\n\r\nYes, we will have to decide whether we want to have scheduled maintenance at possibly shorter intervals or regular breakage at possibly longer intervals. I'd rather opt for the first alternative, but I see the appeal in the latter, given the amount of plugins.\r\n\r\nIMHO the underlying problem here is that we have too much overhead for simple house keeping tasks.
