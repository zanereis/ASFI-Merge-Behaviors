This is why we have to interpolate ourself and also work in maybe way too high of image size.\r\n\r\nBut I noticed a few things while writing this text:\r\n\r\nWe do extend the the 1 bit stencil mask to 8 bit, which might pose an interesting problem:\r\nLooking at the PDFBOX-4218, if instead the image was 48 pixel wide and the mask 6 pixel, and interpolate flag set for the mask, this would create alpha blending near the masked out areas. It would be interesting to create such a file and see how other pdf engines behave. But if this is wrong, one can simply clamp the alpha value to 0 and 255 with a threshold at 127 when writing the alpha value into the stencil mask image (I reckon this should not be done for soft masks). I do believe that the current behaviour is the better choice.\r\n\r\nAs for interpolating the image, if we knew the target resolution it's going to be rendered in the end, we could scale everything bigger than that down to that and then proceed. But we don't and the PDF spec says that mask and image can have different resolutions, even aspect ratios, but get squeezed into the same target rectangle. We need to emulate that and that's why we scale up to the larger one.\r\nSo if we were to not interpolate the image when scaling it up to the mask, we can introduce a crappy, jagged image, which might be actually written 1:1 to the canvas because maybe the mask is in the resolution of the final render. Usually rendering a non masked image to the canvas will do the proper interpolation, whatever is set in the canvas graphics, but we are circumventing that in applyMask() with large masks.\r\n\r\nPDFBOX-2750 doesn't use interpolation so scaleImage doesn't interpolate. And it's just a color soup background (you can't really see it in PDFDebugger because the mask is always applied, but if one disabled the alpha composition in applyMask() it shows the soup). So differences are probably almost invisible. With disabled alpha composition and forced interpolation jagged vs not so jagged diagonal lines are clearly visible in the soup, they are simply not visible with the stencil mask:\r\n![PDF2750-bgsoup_jagged](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23260584/123341607-8a562980-d54e-11eb-8700-f356241c3615.jpg)\r\n![PDF2750-bgsoup_soft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23260584/123341616-8e824700-d54e-11eb-8750-6428b9bd258b.jpg)\r\nStill shows that image interpolation is good when it is requested by the image.\r\n\r\nEven worse, we are violating that overlay principle sometimes:\r\nIf there is an image with 100 x 100 and the mask is 200 x 10, we will scale the mask to 100 x 100 when we actually must scale everything to 200 x 100 as to not deliberately reduce resolution of image or mask.\r\n\r\nSeeing that interpolation is not that slow once we switch to bilinear, I could live with it. For very large scaling operations even worse than 10*10 maybe one should switch to nearest neighbor. I was looking for faster image scaling in java and did find AffineTransformationOp, which is handled by java natively and I thought that the Graphics instances use that already.

But why are you using the trick for COSOutputStream.close? You use fake try-with-resources statement to avoid sonar warnings, then you use swapping of streams to close right stream. Why not use try-with-resources with the correct stream and without RandomAccessOutputStream?

If you will purpose another way it will be good. I mean, if you will use public constructor (instead of private constructor and static method it will be simplier). As you see I got one second faster test results. About uncle Bob, yes but with constructor it will be a little complicated. To change parameters order to add constructor with will not clone an array is not good for this case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/comments/882028500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/comments/882031378","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/pull/107#issuecomment-882031378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pdfbox/issues/107","id":882031378,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAATal840krsS","user":{"login":"valerybokov","id":67366451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzY2NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67366451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov","html_url":"https://github.com/valerybokov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valerybokov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-18T09:56:58Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T09:56:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@THausherr , i have one more proposition.
