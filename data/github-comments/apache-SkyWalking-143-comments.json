Along the setup, I;ve faced couple of roadblock due to the documentation. \r\n\r\nThis reported issue is one of them, even when I went to check Java grpc, it was of no help.\r\n\r\nI understand the goal of Skywalking is to appeal to a more international audience, but the way i see the reported issue being close, that is not at all helpful, and certainly would not appeal to international companies in adopting Skywalking.\r\n\r\nI hope to seek your understanding in the importance of community support for the project.\r\n\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/573420859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/573421072","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4220#issuecomment-573421072","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4220","id":573421072,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQyMTA3Mg==","user":{"login":"codecov-io","id":8655789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTU3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-12T14:34:58Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T10:34:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"#

The thing you posted is exactly an APM should collect.\r\n\r\nBack to my point, this is a basic design of SkyWalking. We should not argue about this in a single one plugin. If you want to discuss that, it is more than this. You need to change the design and protocol of the project.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change this, I prefer you keep that in private, and only push the both sides tracing in the upstream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/573522600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/573524127","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4177#issuecomment-573524127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4177","id":573524127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzUyNDEyNw==","user":{"login":"devkanro","id":9367842,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjc4NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9367842?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro","html_url":"https://github.com/devkanro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devkanro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T06:22:18Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T06:22:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I agree with you, the error of unreachable or network perf unstable issues are also important for service.\r\n\r\nI can simplify client-side tracing for this, like no `onMessage` event, only `Complete/Close` event for internal client-side tracing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/573524127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/comments/573529288","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/4177#issuecomment-573529288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/4177","id":573529288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzUyOTI4OA==","user":{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-13T06:46:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T06:46:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I can simplify client-side tracing for this, like no onMessage event, only Complete/Close event for internal client-side tracing.\r\n\r\nI think in most cases, both of them should exist, including `onMessage/Complete/Close`.
