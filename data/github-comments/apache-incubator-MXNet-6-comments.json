The compromise in Caffe/Mocha.jl is to provide a `SoftmaxLoss` layer that is essentially combined softmax and logistic loss layer, but do (backward) computation together. It is more efficient _and_ numerically stable. But meanwhile, also offer softmax layer and logistic regression layer separately in case people need to do something else. Actually, a while ago, I was working on a project that use a different loss other than the logistic on the softmax output.\n\nIn fact, doing them separately might not be that bad than we think in practice, if you do softmax carefully. I did some experiments quite long time ago (scroll down the [page for the last figure](http://freemind.pluskid.org/machine-learning/softmax-vs-softmax-loss-numerical-stability/)). It seems that the discrepancy is within a reasonable range for relatively bounded inputs even for `Float32`. As far as I know, Theano just [provide softmax and logistic loss separately](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/tensor/nnet/nnet.html), though I do not know if during the compilation stage this actually get optimized into a single `softmax-loss` optimization. If we are still concerned here, the option adopted by Torch might also be possible: they have a `LogSoftmax` layer. :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149637921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/149643262","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/332#issuecomment-149643262","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/332","id":149643262,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTY0MzI2Mg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-20T17:39:54Z","updated_at":"2015-10-20T17:39:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed by #333 \nFor auto detect layout, here is the proposed approach in #339 \n\nAdd a parameter array.layout(default to auto) to fit and predict.

batch\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/150099583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/150099800","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/340#issuecomment-150099800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/340","id":150099800,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDA5OTgwMA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-22T03:58:12Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T03:58:12Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Another

Then it will allow variable-length sequences and automatically reset state propagation over time at the end of the sequence.

Can a python function combine with forward and backward result? **So I see the doc says it could return with NDArray, so I could directly use the forward and backward (gradients) result, right?**\n4. If I can get the forward and backward result in one iteration, then E and M step could be done easily, I could **write my own iteration in python rather than fit into mxnet framework** as you mentioned, right? \n5. Thanks a lot. After my implementation, I would be very happy to provide details about the usecase.\n\nI would continue to arise discussions and asked some questions here. I would now check about the document as you suggested. Thanks a lot\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/150395415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/150396281","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/369#issuecomment-150396281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/369","id":150396281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MDM5NjI4MQ==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-23T00:43:36Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T00:43:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Yes,
