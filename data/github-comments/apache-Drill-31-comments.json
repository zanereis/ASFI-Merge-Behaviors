Suppose Projection sees the following from Files A(F1, F2, F3) and B(F1, F2)\r\n\r\n* Batch A.1 (with F1, F2, F3)\r\n* Batch B.1 (with F1, F2)\r\n\r\nClearly, the project can remember that F3 was previously seen and fill in the missing column. (This is exactly what the new projection logic in the new scan framework does, by the way.) This works, however, only if F3 is nullable. If not... what (non-null) value can we fill in for F3?\r\n\r\nHad we know that F3 would turn up dangling, we could have converted F3 in the first batch to become nullable, but Drill can't predict the future.\r\n\r\nLet's consider the proposal: we drop dangling columns. But, since the dangling column (F3) appeared in the first batch, we didn't know it is dangling. Only when we see the second batch (B.1) do we realize that F3 was dangling and we should have removed it. Again, this algorithm requires effective time travel.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that the order is reversed:\r\n\r\n* Batch B.1 (with F1, F2)\r\n* Batch A.1 (with F1, F2, F3)\r\n\r\nHere, we can identify F3 as dangling and could remove it, so the proposal is sound.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the \"fill in F3\" trick does not work here because Project sends B.1 downstream. Later, it notices that A.1 adds a column. Project can't somehow retroactively add the missing column; all it can do is trigger a schema change downstream. Again, Drill can't predict the future to know that it has to fill in F3 in the first B.1 batch.\r\n\r\nWe've not yet discussed the case in which F2, which exists in both files, has distinct types (INT in A, say and VARCHAR in B). The dangling column trick won't work. The same logic as above applies to the type mismatch.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we use either the \"remove\" or \"fill in\" depending on whether the column appears in the first batch. So, for the following:\r\n\r\n* Batch A.1 (with F1, F2, F3)\r\n* Batch B.1 (with F1, F2)\r\n\r\nThe result would be (F1, F2, F3)\r\n\r\nBut if the input was:\r\n\r\n* Batch B.1 (with F1, F2)\r\n* Batch A.1 (with F1, F2, F3)\r\n\r\nThe result wold be (F1, F2)\r\n\r\nSince the user has no control over the order that files are read, the result would be random: half the time the user gets one schema, the other half the other. It is unlikely that the user will perceive that as a feature.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion is that there is no way that Project can \"smooth\" the schema in the general case: it would have to predict the future to do so.\r\n\r\nNow, let's think about other operators, Sort, say. Suppose we do `SELECT * FROM foo ORDER BY x`. In this case, there is no project. The Sort operator will see batches with differing schemas, but must sort/merge them together. The schemas must match. The Sort tries to do this by using the union type (actually works, there is a unit test for it somewhere) if columns have conflicting types. I suspect it does not work if a column is missing from some batches. (Would need to test.)\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the situation is worse if the dangling column is the sort key!\r\n\r\nOverall, while it is very appealing to think that dangling columns are a \"bug\" for which there is a fix, the reality is not so simple. This is an inherent ambiguity in the Drill model for which there is no fix that both works and is consistent with SQL semantics.\r\n\r\nWhat would work? A schema! Suppose we are told that the schema is (F1: INT, F2: VARCHAR, F3: nullable DOUBLE). Now, when Project (or even the scanner) notices that F3 is missing, it knows to add in the required column of the correct type and, voila! no schema change.\r\n\r\nSuppose that B defines F2 as INT. We know we want a VARCHAR, and so can do an implicit conversion. Again, voila! no schema change.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I completely agree that the scenario described is a problem.

My observation based on profiling I did sometime back is that the performance gains seen here are roughly in line with removing bounds checks. Paul has seen similar gains in the batch sizing project.\r\nWhich takes us back to the question, raised by Paul in his first comment, of how we want to reconcile batch sizing and vectorizing of scans; a question we have deferred. If removing bounds checks gets us the same performance gains, then why not would put our efforts in implementing batch sizing with the accompanying elimination in bounds checking. \r\nI'm mostly not in favor of having MemoryUtils unless you make a compelling argument that it is the only way to save the planet (i.e get the performance you want). I feel operators should not establish the pattern of accessing memory directly.

thanks for tackling such a difficult, core issue in Drill. Drill claims to be a) schema free and b) SQL compliant. SQL is based on operations over relations with a fixed number of columns of fixed types. Reconciling these two ideas is very difficult. Even the original Drill developers, who built a huge amount of code very quickly, and who had intimate knowledge of the Drill internals, even they did not find a good solution which is why the problem is still open.\r\n\r\nThere are two obvious approaches: 1) redefine SQL to operate over lists of maps (with arbitrary name/value pairs that differ across rows), or 2) define translation rules from schema-free input into the schema-full relations that SQL requires.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to go down the first route: redefine SQL. To be successful, we'd want to rely on research papers, if any, that show how to reformulate relational theory on top of lists of maps rather than on relations and domains.\r\n\r\nThe other approach is to define conversion rules: something much more on the order of a straight-forward implementation project. Can the user provide conversion rules (in the form of a schema) when the conversion is ambiguous? Would users rather encounter schema change exceptions or provide the conversion rules? These are interesting open questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/377572391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/377573035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1170#issuecomment-377573035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1170","id":377573035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzU3MzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"paul-rogers","id":3248881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDg4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3248881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-rogers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-rogers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-30T17:11:44Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T17:11:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Over the last year, we've tended to favor including unit tests with each PR.
