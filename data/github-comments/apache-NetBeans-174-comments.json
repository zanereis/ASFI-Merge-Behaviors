I have noted that copying a class in project  \"resets\" the state but as [bradvido](https://github.com/bradvido) noted, copying \"nothing\" in editor (yes it is possible!) resets the state also, just select a line that has nothing (not even a space) and press right mouse button, then copy this \"void\" and the clipboard state resets. It actually copies nothing and keeps already copied material as it is... but it resets. Weird..\r\n\r\nThis looks like that a second state in clipboard exists at the same time, by copying this \"void\" you can use and paste the real external copied material (it is already there !!! not need to copy it again), if not, last editor copy will be used !!!\r\n\r\nSomething is messing up those double clipboard states, maybe the \"void\" copy is the ghost that will lead to debugging even without total replication, but the bug is so common that 4-5 back and forth copy/paste sessions will reveal it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1641767902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1641842447","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/5969#issuecomment-1641842447","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/5969","id":1641842447,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5h3IcP","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T10:35:42Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:35:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@asbachb

The issue seems to be related to doc-comments parser. It suffices to add a `@return` comment with a 'generic type' syntax to freeze \"Fix Imports\" function, for example: `@return array<int, Whatever>`. However, the project size must be large enough so that it has to check many classes.\r\n\r\nI used Magento for testing. The steps to reproduce are to clone its repo, initialize Composer dependencies and then beef it up some more by adding additional dependencies known to be rather large (I could tell a difference even without additional dependencies but it wasn't so severe):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/magento/magento2.git .\r\n\r\ncomposer install\r\n\r\ncomposer require aws/aws-php-sns-message-validator:* facebook/graph-sdk:* facebook/php-business-sdk:* google/apiclient:* nikic/php-parser:* phing/phing:* php-coord/php-coord:* phpoffice/phpspreadsheet:*\r\n```\r\n\r\nI searched for a function that returned array and the first file I found was `app/code/Magento/ReleaseNotification/Model/ResourceModel/Viewer/Logger.php` and its method `loadLatestLogData`. It is probably not very important which file or function to use though. At this point, fixing imports worked as it should, even if I tried edits resulting in new `use` statements being added. I found the following edits to cause the freezes:\r\n\r\n- `@return array<int, Whatever>`\r\n- `@return array<int>`\r\n- `@return list<int>`\r\n- `@return Whatever<int>`\r\n- `@return Whatever<max>`\r\n- etc\r\n\r\nBut not this:\r\n\r\n- `@return int<0, 100>`\r\n- `@return int<0, max>`\r\n- `@return array{int, int}`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1642683806/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1642691601","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6193#issuecomment-1642691601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6193","id":1642691601,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5h6XwR","user":{"login":"asbachb","id":1482768,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI3Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482768?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb","html_url":"https://github.com/asbachb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asbachb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T20:13:03Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T20:13:03Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Actually I'm not 100% sure what consequences are when providing (you mean the module should ship it as dependency?).
