(specifically, `to_duckdb` calls `to_arrow` which calls `project_table`).  `project_table` both generates the projection plan based on the iceberg schema and executes the projection, loading a PyArrow table into memory for every file in the scan plan and concatenating them together.  The concatenated table is what ultimately gets passed around to pyarrow or duckdb, which is not great if e.g. your subsequent queries could have benefited from further pushdown that would have limited the amount of data that needed to be read.\r\n\r\nSo, @wjones127, ideally there'd be some way to express this Iceberg schema reconciliation logic directly in a PyArrow dataset, which would become the logical source node passed to different engines to do their own querying/pushdown.  Some time ago I think I looked at how feasible this would be to do in pyarrow Dataset and I _think_ I concluded it wasn't possible yet -- specifically, that there was not a way for PyArrow dataset to have a different projection plan for every file in a dataset, which is potentially required in Iceberg given how the schema may have evolved over time --  but my recollection is a little hazy.

I've added some comments to the Google doc and also the pull request that describes the interface.\r\n\r\n@corleyma has a good point here. I think the main reason why Arrow doesn't have an Iceberg implementation today is that it is quite a lot of work to get the details right. And the details make Iceberg so performant.\r\n\r\nAs https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/33986 suggest I think it would be great for PyIceberg to be able to produce and consume substrait plans. It could consume a light-level plan `SELECT * FROM s3://bucket/path/json@snapshot-id WHERE date_field => 2023-01-01` and produce a low-level plan where it would tell Arrow which files to read, and what kind of projection needs to be done. It will become complex though, for example, how would we express [positional deletes](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/6775)? It can be done but would need some changes to substrait I assume.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm all in to see if we can integrate PyIceberg into Arrow. I agree that the dataset is the ideal situation. If there is anything that you want me to try, please let me know, I'm happy to help and see if we can make this work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1548031781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1548033388","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7612#issuecomment-1548033388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7612","id":1548033388,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cRR1s","user":{"login":"gaborkaszab","id":29145491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborkaszab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-15T15:00:26Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T15:00:26Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I did a search and apparently almost all the usages for this withPartitionPath(path) is for tests, that is fine.

It seems like perhaps it would for writing to the catalog, but if I understand correctly it might be able to read the catalog as if it were a Hive Metastore?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1548982189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1549007416","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7572#issuecomment-1549007416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7572","id":1549007416,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cU_o4","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-16T05:20:27Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T05:20:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Let me take a look as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1549007416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1549012077","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7361#issuecomment-1549012077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7361","id":1549012077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cVAxt","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-16T05:27:10Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T05:27:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Merging, since we have 2 approving reviews and CI passed.

I think what's new in this proposal is the idea that you would write your own classes for `Scanner`, `Dataset`, and `Fragment`. That would give you full control over how they are implemented, but using the standard API allows various engines to know how to push down projections and filters. So the question is: is there anything in the proposed interface that seems to be a blocker?\r\n\r\nThere might also be utilities you need from PyArrow. For example, the residual filter functionality you mention is handled in Arrow C++ by a function called SimplifyWithGuarantee, but that's not exposed in Python.

> specifically, that there was not a way for PyArrow dataset to have a different projection plan for every file in a dataset, which is potentially required in Iceberg given how the schema may have evolved over time\n> \n> \n> \n> Yes. I think what's new in this proposal is the idea that you would write your own classes for `Scanner`, `Dataset`, and `Fragment`. That would give you full control over how they are implemented, but using the standard API allows various engines to know how to push down projections and filters. So the question is: is there anything in the proposed interface that seems to be a blocker?\n> \n> \n> \n> There might also be utilities you need from PyArrow. For example, the residual filter functionality you mention is handled in Arrow C++ by a function called SimplifyWithGuarantee, but that's not exposed in Python. ([See the \"how does filter pushdown work?\" section here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XGg1pf9Nep9GHlSdvO65Ao1kyQ_Z_g55uyHuTYVyeT0/edit#heading=h.i5fe7gminhk3))\n\nHonestly, and perhaps dumbly, this option of PyIceberg implementing a  dataset-compatible interface didn't occur to me!  I like the idea a lot, though, particularly if the interface is settling on something relatively stable.\n\nI looked at the code in PyIceberg again and I remembered an idea I had that I never tested.  Right now, the implementation eagerly loads a table for every file-level projection and concats them.  Would it be possible instead to create a pyarrow dataset for every file and return a union dataset that combines them?  I've never touched these lower level features of PyArrow datasets before so this idea is all based on hazy recollection of source code reading from long ago.\n\nIf this is something PyArrow supports today (unioning datasets with different projection plans that produce the same final schema, without materializing a table), then it could be the easiest way to achieve the \"pyiceberg returns a dataset that is compatible with iceberg schema evolution\", at least for copy-on-write workloads.  \n\nI haven't thought much about positional deletes but I suspect that would require custom dataset interface implementation-- again, that might be the best solution in general anyway, though if pyiceberg were able to leverage only the interfaces as defined in pyarrow there would be less concern about drift between feature support over time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1549995368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1549996259","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7555#issuecomment-1549996259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7555","id":1549996259,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cYxDj","user":{"login":"gaborkaszab","id":29145491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborkaszab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborkaszab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-16T16:28:33Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T16:28:33Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks for the reviews, @amogh-jahagirdar @aokolnychyi @rdblue @stevenzwu @jackye1995 !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1549996259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550032814","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7174#issuecomment-1550032814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7174","id":1550032814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cY5-u","user":{"login":"jkolash","id":801170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTE3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/801170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash","html_url":"https://github.com/jkolash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkolash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-16T16:53:44Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T16:53:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"When can we expect a new 1.2.2 release with this included?

If I have time I will build a comparison between ThreadPool and ProcessPool based loading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550601530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550610451","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7571#issuecomment-1550610451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7571","id":1550610451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cbHAT","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T02:52:56Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T02:52:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @pvary for the contribution and @hililiwei for the review","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550610451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550643780","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7171#issuecomment-1550643780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7171","id":1550643780,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cbPJE","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T03:38:16Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T03:38:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @stevenzwu, We also have a requirement to migrate the table without restarting the Flink job since users may have thousands of production streaming jobs online. Right now, I don't have a full solution in my mind, the early thinking is to notify the task manager to update the writer after checkpoint. Do you have a such kind requirement as well? Any idea？\r\n\r\n@chenjunjiedada we probably can take this discussion in a separate issue. I remember some previous ask in this area about handling table schema evolution without manual intervention. I couldn't seem to find the PR or issue. there are two slightly different asks.\r\n\r\n1. table schema is already updated/synced via external mechanism (like control plane). Just need the writer and committer to pick up the latest schema (or partition spec) without job restart.\r\n2. need writer to detect table schema is out of sync with the record schema. automatically update the table schema and write with latest schema.\r\n\r\ncase 1 can be implemented with resolving the write schema (or partition spec) not during job initialization, rather during task initialization. writers periodically check (e.g. every checkpoint cycle) if table schema or partition spec changed. if changed, writers can fail the job. Restart and task initialization will load the latest schema and spec. However, it does bring scalability concern because every writer task (hundreds or more) need to load a Iceberg table from catalog to retrieve the schema and partition spec.\r\n\r\nCase 2 can be implemented similarly. But it is more risky. if bad records (schema) can cause unintended change in Iceberg table schema. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550643780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550709396","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/7431#issuecomment-1550709396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7431","id":1550709396,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cbfKU","user":{"login":"BsoBird","id":30249475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjQ5NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30249475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird","html_url":"https://github.com/BsoBird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BsoBird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T04:36:06Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T04:36:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@szehon-ho \r\nSounds good, I'll test it first after v1.3 is released","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550709396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550717223","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7617#issuecomment-1550717223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7617","id":1550717223,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cbhEn","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T04:39:40Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T04:39:40Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I would get @huaxingao 's input on this one","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550717223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/1550769543","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/7601#issuecomment-1550769543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/7601","id":1550769543,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCW7NX85cbt2H","user":{"login":"nastra","id":271029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra","html_url":"https://github.com/nastra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nastra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-17T05:39:46Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T05:39:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the additional review @singhpk234.
