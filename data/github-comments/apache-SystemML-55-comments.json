Couple of notes, let me know what you think:\r\n\r\n>     * I've added an extra dot to data generation scripts, to go back a directory, if the command is \"systemds\". This is done to compensate the different folder structure of the perftests when ran locally, instead of on a cluster.\r\n\r\nDon't like this since it implies a different folder to run the scripts from, as seen in the comments above.\r\n\r\n>     * I'm assuming the federated tests are to be ran locally only, not on a cluster.\r\n\r\nTrue, they are running with localhost workers, We want to add the federated things, but it require a bit of setup and remote machines so not obvious for a perf benchmark.\r\n\r\n>     * The stratified statistics benchmark needs a heap size of at least 10 GB. This setting is exported only when it's ran locally via \"export SYSTEMDS_STANDALONE_OPTS=\"-Xmx10g -Xms10g -Xmn2000m\"\r\n\r\nChange this, so that it is set via a settings file, or other means.\r\n\r\n>     * The K-means built-in function does a predict implicitly, meaning the benchmark predicts twice, as of now.\r\n\r\nFor now i think we just ignore this.\r\n\r\n>     * Could not get the decision tree training built-in function to run.\r\n\r\nOkay, then leave it out commented and focus on the other parts.\r\n\r\n>       * It does not stop when ran with logistic regression data.\r\n\r\nhmm, this might be a bug, please if you want to, report it as such in JIRA with a way to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12335852\r\n\r\n>       * There are scripts to generate decision tree data, but these can not be ran either as the built-in transform function does not exist anymore, apparently.\r\n>     * Could also not get the old decision tree and random forest algorithms running without looking deeper into it. (null pointer exception)\r\n\r\nHere leave them out commented, the decision tree and random forest have to be worked on anyway..\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/992732966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/992850944","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/1480#issuecomment-992850944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1480","id":992850944,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc47LbQA","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-13T20:15:03Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T20:15:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Note
