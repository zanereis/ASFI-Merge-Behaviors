CosId-Core has no dependencies(I can remove *Guava* dependency Or keep the guava version consistent with ShardingSphere),But in order to solve the *SnowflakeId* `machineId` allocation problem, *CosId-Redis* needs to depend on *Redis*(`io.lettuce:lettuce-core`). For the id segment mode, the ID segment distribution problem, you need to depend on *Jdbc*(`java.sql.*`) or *Redis*(`io.lettuce:lettuce-core`).\r\n2. Yes,The distributed ID provided by CosId only supports returning `long`(Because we will not choose Date or varchar as the primary key).[ https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/blob/main/cosid-core/src/main/java/me/ahoo/cosid/IdGenerator.java]( https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/blob/main/cosid-core/src/main/java/me/ahoo/cosid/IdGenerator.java)\r\n3. Yes,I can merge  COSID_INTERVAL_DATE, COSID_INTERVAL_LDT , COSID_INTERVAL_TS and COSID_INTERVAL_TS_SECOND together.We don’t need to distinguish between them, I will parse it by checking the shard value type.[https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/releases/tag/v1.4.6](https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/releases/tag/v1.4.6)\r\n4. CosId implements two types of distributed Id: SnowflakeId and SegmentId.\r\nBut we know that only the algorithm provided by *SnowflakeId* is completely insufficient. For example, *ShardingSphere* did not consider the issue of machineId allocation when implementing *SnowflakeId* (*ShardingSphere* provides manual allocation, but this is in flexible deployment The process is shown to be inefficient), and *CosId* provides *MachineIdDistributor* to solve this problem. Of course there are other features.\r\n[Here is a more detailed introduction, such as the optimization of the number segment mode](https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md)\r\n   - We know the partitioning method of *SnowflakeId*, *SnowflakeId* can parse out the timestamp, that is, *SnowflakeId* can be used as time, so *SnowflakeId* can be used as an *INTERVAL* allocation algorithm. (When there is no *CreateTime* available shards [this is a very extreme situation], or when there is a very extreme requirement for performance, the distributed ID primary key as the query range may be a better choice for the performance of the persistence layer.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/991696186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/991817476","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13596#issuecomment-991817476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/13596","id":991817476,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M47He8E","user":{"login":"cheese8","id":25882819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODgyODE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25882819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8","html_url":"https://github.com/cheese8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheese8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-12T01:34:01Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T01:34:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"assign

CosId-Core has no dependencies(I can remove _Guava_ dependency Or keep the guava version consistent with ShardingSphere),But in order to solve the _SnowflakeId_ `machineId` allocation problem, _CosId-Redis_ needs to depend on _Redis_(`io.lettuce:lettuce-core`). For the id segment mode, the ID segment distribution problem, you need to depend on _Jdbc_(`java.sql.*`) or _Redis_(`io.lettuce:lettuce-core`).\r\n\r\n\r\nRedis is not reg-center component of ShardingSphere, could you consider about use ZooKeeper or Etcd as `cluster mode` of ShardingSphere? Maybe we need to integrate with ShardingSphere deeply.\r\n\r\n> 2. Yes,The distributed ID provided by CosId only supports returning `long`(Because we will not choose Date or varchar as the primary key).[ https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/blob/main/cosid-core/src/main/java/me/ahoo/cosid/IdGenerator.java](https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/blob/main/cosid-core/src/main/java/me/ahoo/cosid/IdGenerator.java)\r\n\r\nOK\r\n\r\n> 3. Yes,I can merge  COSID_INTERVAL_DATE, COSID_INTERVAL_LDT , COSID_INTERVAL_TS and COSID_INTERVAL_TS_SECOND together.We don’t need to distinguish between them, I will parse it by checking the shard value type.https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/releases/tag/v1.4.6\r\n\r\nHow to process use real timestamp as business column value, just use original interval timestamp?\r\n\r\n> 4. CosId implements two types of distributed Id: SnowflakeId and SegmentId.\r\n>    But we know that only the algorithm provided by _SnowflakeId_ is completely insufficient. For example, _ShardingSphere_ did not consider the issue of machineId allocation when implementing _SnowflakeId_ (_ShardingSphere_ provides manual allocation, but this is in flexible deployment The process is shown to be inefficient), and _CosId_ provides _MachineIdDistributor_ to solve this problem. Of course there are other features.\r\n>    [Here is a more detailed introduction, such as the optimization of the number segment mode](https://github.com/Ahoo-Wang/CosId/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md)\r\n\r\nIf COSID's snowflake algorithm is good enough, ShardingSphere can use it to instead of the original one, but it is better to keep type of algorithm as `SNOWFLAKE`, it is fine if add new types of `COSID_SEGMENT` and COSID_SEGMENT_CHAIN`.\r\n\r\n>    \r\n>    * We know the partitioning method of _SnowflakeId_, _SnowflakeId_ can parse out the timestamp, that is, _SnowflakeId_ can be used as time, so _SnowflakeId_ can be used as an _INTERVAL_ allocation algorithm. (When there is no _CreateTime_ available shards [this is a very extreme situation], or when there is a very extreme requirement for performance, the distributed ID primary key as the query range may be a better choice for the performance of the persistence layer.)\r\n\r\nYes. totally agree. \r\n\r\nBecause of original snowflake algorithm had implemented by ShardingSphere already, so it is better to keep name consist, for new key generators and sharding algorithms, we can introduce brand of `COSID`.\r\n\r\nThe summaries are: \r\n\r\n1. Add new 2 key generators: `COSID_SEGMENT` and COSID_SEGMENT_CHAIN`, and update original `SNOWFLAKE`\r\n2. Add sharding algorithms with `SNOWFLAKE`, and `COSID_TIME_INTERVAL`.\r\n3. Integrate `COSID_SEGMENT` and `COSID_SEGMENT_CHAIN` with ShardingSphere deeply, just reuse reg-center of `cluster mode`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/991845580/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/comments/991853318","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14061#issuecomment-991853318","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shardingsphere/issues/14061","id":991853318,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAvkN_M47HnsG","user":{"login":"terrymanu","id":5516298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu","html_url":"https://github.com/terrymanu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terrymanu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-12T08:17:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-12T08:17:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Great!
