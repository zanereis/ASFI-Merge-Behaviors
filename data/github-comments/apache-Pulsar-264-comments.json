@flowchartsman\r\nI think to get `userConfigs` by create a new `FunctionContext` is a little bit odd, especially in some scenarios like initialize database connections before go function starts. The reason I think it is odd is that `FunctionContext` is an implementation of request-scoped values that passed with `context.Value`, and the context should only be integrated within the instance of go function. Once we propagate `FunctionContext` outside the go function instance, it will break the design of `context`.\r\n\r\nSo i suggest we have two ways to get `userConfigs`:\r\n\r\n- When go function starts (`pf.Start` called), user can get `userConfigs` with `FromContext(ctx)`, like `contextFunc` defined above.

I was just surprised by deadLetterPolicy() auto-setting ackTImeoutMillis to 30s and breaking my time-consuming message processing. And also confused by changes in #3014 implying that ackTImeoutMillis was necessary (but I now see that NACKs were implemented after the DLQ feature so makes sense why it was the default at that time).\r\n\r\nOh, I see. The #3014 is merged before the NACK support. I also have no idea how to avoid incompatibility. Maybe we can add more documents for the dead letter policy to describe the default 30s ack timeout will remove from the subsequent release.\r\n\r\nI think the 30s ack timeout that the dead letter topic introduced overwrite the ack timeout of the consumer. So it's better to add a flag to indicate the ack timeout is set by user, the dead letter policy should not overwrite it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/726057120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/726063442","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8538#issuecomment-726063442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8538","id":726063442,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjA2MzQ0Mg==","user":{"login":"wolfstudy","id":20965307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20965307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfstudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-12T13:01:29Z","updated_at":"2020-11-12T13:01:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot

The schema update (via AllowAutoUpdateSchema) is in this case not necessary.\r\n\r\nMaybe a normalisation of the json schema string while updating/comparing the schema on broker side (in case of manual upload or generated from class) would solve this.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it could happen by using different clients/versions (of pulsar/avro/jackson...) that the schema is updated every time when a client connects that generates a different representation of the json string.\r\n\r\nIf this not a bug, please see it as feature request","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/726579708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/726580148","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/8352#issuecomment-726580148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8352","id":726580148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjU4MDE0OA==","user":{"login":"wolfstudy","id":20965307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20965307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfstudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T07:45:23Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T07:45:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"```\r\nError:  Tests run: 3, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 153.034 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.pulsar.client.api.ClientDeduplicationFailureTest\r\nError:  testClientDeduplicationCorrectnessWithFailure(org.apache.pulsar.client.api.ClientDeduplicationFailureTest)  Time elapsed: 20.957 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.io.IOException: Error open RocksDB database\r\n\tat org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.storage.ldb.KeyValueStorageRocksDB.<init>(KeyValueStorageRocksDB.java:184)\r\n\tat org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.storage.ldb.KeyValueStorageRocksDB.<init>(KeyValueStorageRocksDB.java:85)\r\n\tat org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.storage.ldb.KeyValueStorageRocksDB.lambda$static$0(KeyValueStorageRocksDB.java:60)\r\n\tat org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.storage.ldb.LedgerMetadataIndex.<init>(LedgerMetadataIndex.java:69)\r\n\tat org.apache.bookkeeper.bookie.storage.ldb.SingleDirectoryDbLedgerStorage.<init>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/726580148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/726599622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/8553#issuecomment-726599622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/8553","id":726599622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjU5OTYyMg==","user":{"login":"jiazhai","id":6348208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6348208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai","html_url":"https://github.com/jiazhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiazhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T08:25:33Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T08:25:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @ltamber for this initiative.

This will introduce more GC workload and need more CPU cycles to repack the message. You can see https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-70%3A-Introduce-lightweight-raw-Message-metadata, try to avoid serialize and deserialize the message again on the server-side.\r\n\r\nI want to describe my rough idea, If it is a batch message, we have message metadata for the batch and single message metadata for each message. So I think we can add all tags into the message metadata of the batch. For example, 2 messages in a batch and property1 for message0 is 1, property1 for message1 is 2. So that we can add property1 = [1,2] in the batch message metadata. So, the broker can filter out the batches. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/727122863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
