good question. The 7ns target is passed to HLS to insert pipeline register in the synthesized module in order to close timing. It turns out that if you set the target period to 10ns, the design won’t close timing at 100MHz. Setting a more aggressive target in HLS will insert more registers and therefore allow us to close timing at 100MHz more easily. It’s a bit of a hack but it works. I’m working on changes to the design to ensure improved timing closure. For the intel back end, I would say that this parameter wouldn’t matter if the intel HLS compiler and P&R flow did a better job at closing timing at the specified target.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/416016343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/416017560","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/1572#issuecomment-416017560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1572","id":416017560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjAxNzU2MA==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-26T06:37:59Z","updated_at":"2018-08-26T06:37:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dayanandasiet  Can you confirm the attr implement (where @srkreddy1238 comment 'Suggest to use transforms instead of ignores & extras') is good?

@jroesch for the proposal, I am going to elaborate some of my take on this proposal.  Note that no design is perfect and that is why we need help of everyone to work together the evolve the IR.\r\n\r\n## Specific Technical Points\r\n- Tight integration with TVM node system. NNVM was designed pre-tvm so we did not put tvm runtime into consideration. This makes registering python callback, traversing the IR and interaction hard for the current nnvm. Relay refactor directly bring this tight integration, now every IR can be visited, inspected and we can do prototyping in both python and c++ easily. This is a feature that has nothing to do with the IR spec but never the less very significant for developers.\r\n- Shape/dtype integrated as TensorType, reuse symbolic integer(tvm::Expr). One advantage of TOPI description is that it is possible to support symbolic integer in many cases, so the code can be generic on one dimension(e.g. batch), the TensorType also reuses this. This makes things consistent with TOPI and allows declaration of specific programs like input size (n, 128, 128)\r\n- Control flows, if, for(via tail recursion) and function recursion.\r\n- Separation of compiler IR and runtime.

After all, we could not assume each user has a PhD degree in PL. Here are several things we might need to consider in the future.\r\n\r\n### Container types\r\nI would love to discuss the necessity of having containers like `List<T>`, `Dict<K, V>`. This concern raises from some deep learning model in NLP. For example, self-attention, which is used in sequence generation tasks.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef self-attentive-generator():\r\n  initialize states\r\n  initialize outputs = []\r\n  while True:\r\n    prev_outputs = concat(outputs)\r\n    context_vector = self-attention(prev_outputs, inputs, state)\r\n    step_output, states = DecoderStep(states, prev_outputs)\r\n    outputs.append(step_output)\r\n    if some_condition:\r\n      break\r\n  outputs = concat(outputs)\r\n  return outputs, states\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe already have `Tuple<T_1, ...>` in Relay, which is great. We could definitely ask users to convert it to a FP style so that everything has no side effect, and while performance is not quite affected, but are we able to reduce the memory footprint in this case?\r\n\r\nSupporting `Dict<K, V>` is somewhat weird requirement, but it seems to me that states in RNN are often represented using a dict (need confirmation from @szha). I guess we could probably replace this with something like `namedtuple`.\r\n\r\nOther weird use cases may include Fast WaveNet, Pixel CNN++, beam search in decoding, many of while requires users to write a normal program to manipulate containers, which is easier for common users to write in an imperative style, rather than FP. I am a big fan of FPs like Haskell, but yet a little bit worried\r\n1) whether the market likes this style of programming.\r\n2) whether this IR could support such optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Side effects, e.g. I/O and random monad\r\nFor example, in dropout, we should definitely introduce something with randomness.\r\n\r\nThis is just a remainder that these are stuff we should take into consideration.\r\n\r\n### Whether to incorporate context into the type system\r\nI am also wondering if `ctx` could be put into the type system. This is kind of co-design with TVM.\r\n\r\n### Primitives related to distributed system\r\nThis is kind of off the topic, but I am personally interested in seeing brilliant ideas about how we could handle these situations.\r\n\r\nA. SyncBN: This introduces allreduce in the forward pass. Of course, such ugly thing like forward/backward will never exist in Relay, which is great, but it seems that we should introduce synchronization primitives in the design.\r\n\r\nB. Timeout: It is common practice on an edge device to store a smaller DL model offline, which is used to produce a coarse result; in the meantime, an online model on remote servers computes some part of and send it back. In case the online model failed to send the fine-grind result in time, the edge device would use the offline result. This is another kind of side-effect, should we handle this in a deep learning framework, or leave it to others?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/417092885/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/417119816","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/1673#issuecomment-417119816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1673","id":417119816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzExOTgxNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-29T21:57:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T21:57:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"+1 on making things accessible(worse is better), this is exactly what we should push for.\r\n\r\n Making most part functional makes differentiation easy and allows build the things around. It is important to be able to support mutation in some of the outer loops, where diff is not needed. Have such clear distinction is important.\r\n\r\nThe List Dict programming style is more like multi staging program, where the graph is staged in the data structure before we call backward.
