Infer shape function is more complicated than the previous version since we need to support step, while the previous version assumes step=1.\r\n2. Kernel needs to take care of step as well.\r\n3.

This first stage could be to segment tests that run each PR from ones that run nightly.  The second could be to optimize the nightly tests (or create fast-running tests with equivalent coverage) and make those unit tests that run on PR builds again.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it to yourself and the commiters to decide how best to fix the current tests.  This PR hopefully can at least be a first crack at test segmentation in case you want a reference to discuss.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/342756833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/342756881","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/1356#issuecomment-342756881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1356","id":342756881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Mjc1Njg4MQ==","user":{"login":"Jing-Luo","id":20852189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODUyMTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20852189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo","html_url":"https://github.com/Jing-Luo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jing-Luo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-08T09:15:58Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T09:16:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"```\r\ninit = mx.initializer.Mixed(['bias', '.*'], [mx.init.Zero(), mx.init.Xavier(magnitude=2.24)])\r\nnet.collect_params().initialize(init, ctx=ctx)\r\n```\r\nIt seems that Mixed type is different from those normal ones.
