Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.

The majority of popular languages can be analyzed automatically; no configuration is required!\r\n\r\nWith [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/github), you get:\r\n\r\n-   Fast, precise static analysis and feedback on your code\r\n    \r\n-   Support for popular languages, frameworks, and IaC tools\r\n    \r\n-   Free analysis for open-source projects and private projects up to max 50k LoC\r\n    \r\n-   Automatic analysis of pull requests and branches with results reported inline\r\n    \r\n-   IDE Support with [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) integration\r\n    \r\n-   Quality Gate (added as a GitHub check) acting at two different levels - first, preventing you from merging pull requests that contain issues - and later, helping you to release only clean, safe code\r\n    \r\n-   Sign up for SonarQube free tier and begin scanning your private and public repositories\r\n    \r\n\r\nA [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sonarcloud-scan) is available in the marketplace to make it easy for you (for projects where automatic analysis isn't available).

Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.

Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work? Only paid users can view reports and post statuses/comments.
