of `<subpackages>` seems to change sigtest behavior:\r\n\r\nWhen I run Ant target `gen-sigtest` without `<subpackages>` (commit d739624220de5813b921f55916372f5f62573975), then `org-netbeans-libs-flatlaf.sig` **grows** from 62k to **380k** (because of added packages) and gen-sigtest reports following error:\r\n~~~\r\nRETURN TYPE FOR FlatFileChooserUI::createDirectoryComboBoxRenderer\r\n    CHANGED FROM javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalFileChooserUI$DirectoryComboBoxRenderer\r\n    TO javax.swing.DefaultListCellRenderer\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBut when using `<subpackages>` (commit 3c14ba953043549a871ee5054cb54f377e7f9cae), `org-netbeans-libs-flatlaf.sig` **shrinks** from 62k to **24k** and gen-sigtest does not report any error. `org-netbeans-libs-flatlaf.sig` **does not** contain any class from the subpackages.\r\n\r\nWhen using following, `org-netbeans-libs-flatlaf.sig` stays unchanged.\r\n~~~xml\r\n<subpackages>com.formdev.flatlaf</subpackages>\r\n<package>com.formdev.flatlaf.util</package>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI wonder what the consequences are for module versioning and API checks...\r\nDoes this mean that only package `com.formdev.flatlaf` is checked for API changes?\r\nAnd API changes in subpackages are ok?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Regarding FlatLaf API compatibility\r\n\r\nOnly classes in packages `com.formdev.flatlaf` and `com.formdev.flatlaf.util` are kept API compatible.\r\nThere is a sigtest task in [flatlaf-core/build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf/blob/main/flatlaf-core/build.gradle.kts) that automatically checks it.\r\nDue to future development, classes in all other package are internal and may (and do) change (without notice).\r\n\r\n### NetBeans module versioning\r\n\r\nTo my understanding, when doing incompatible API changes, the modules \"Major release version\" must be increased, which makes all modules, that depend on it, incompatible. IMHO this should be prevented in any case because this causes problems with 3rd party plugins.\r\n\r\nE.g. [JFormDesigner v8](https://www.formdev.com/jformdesigner/) depends on module `org.netbeans.libs.flatlaf/1`. If NB 16 would use a newer FlatLaf version with changes in subpackages, it needs to change major version to `org.netbeans.libs.flatlaf/2`, which makes JFormDesigner v8 incompatible with NB16. Sure, can update JFormDesigner to depend on `org.netbeans.libs.flatlaf/2`, but then it no longer works with previous NB versions. So it would be necessary to build and distribute two JFormDesigner builds: one for NB 16 and another one for NB 15 and older. This would be a nightmare for me and for JFormDesigner users...\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nIf this PR means that all classes in all FlatLaf subpackages are handled as \"module API\" and can not changed any more, then I'm against this PR. Then it is better to make changes to `flatlaf-swingx.jar` to avoid usage of non-public packages. (I'll check this)\r\n\r\nIf sigtest behavior regarding `<subpackages>` is normal and expected (not a bug), then I'm fine with this PR.\r\nBut please also add `<package>com.formdev.flatlaf.util</package>` to `project.xml` to keep  `org-netbeans-libs-flatlaf.sig` unchanged.\r\n\r\nAnyway IMO it is strange that `<subpackages>` makes all subpackages public but sigtest ignores them... 😕 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1243989391/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1243995586","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/4575#issuecomment-1243995586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/4575","id":1243995586,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5KJd3C","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T16:34:09Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T16:34:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There is nothing stopping you writing nashorn/rhino compatible JS with NetBeans.

pushed an update into my branch (https://github.com/matthiasblaesing/netbeans/commits/antlr4-support).\r\n\r\nThe idea is this: The NB indexer is to limited and to big to fix the issue for antlr files. We are lucky, in that they only allow import from the local directory. With this limit in mind and considering that we have a limited number of grammar files in each directory, we should be able to get away with a local indexer. This is implemented as `AntlrLocalIndex`, which caches the parser results for the local antlr files, which should make them readily available.\r\n\r\nBased on that modification I implemented \"Where used\" support.\r\n\r\nFinally I found a problem, where I could not use the navigation entries in the structure display to jump inside the grammar files.
