Essentially we have to forbid all user code that follows execute(), collect(), print(), count().\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146899718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146901927","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1214#issuecomment-146901927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1214","id":146901927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjkwMTkyNw==","user":{"login":"sachingoel0101","id":8874261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzQyNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8874261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101","html_url":"https://github.com/sachingoel0101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachingoel0101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T15:22:05Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T15:22:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"That won't suffice. Even if we allow one execute call, we cannot be sure that user won't try to access the `JobExecutionResult`. That also is an issue.\nDisallowing every program which doesn't implement the `Program` interface isn't a good solution. I'm not an expert but most people would usually have a main method. In that case, it doesn't make sense to have a detached mode if we cannot allow such executions.\nWe might be able to detect the exact program structure by exploiting the Context Environment. Before actually executing the program, we instead first do a validation.\n1. On an execute call, instead of actually executing the program, we instead build the plan and store it. If another call to execute comes in, we fail.\n2. The `JobExecutionResult` can be wrapped in a `DetachedExecutionResult` which will fail if user tries to access, say accumulators.\n\nIn the documentation for detached mode, we should specify that only programs with one execute call, and no usage of the execution result will be allowed. This handles the eager execution issue also.\nBut I'm concerned this isn't the best possible design.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146901927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146902805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1241#issuecomment-146902805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1241","id":146902805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjkwMjgwNQ==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T15:24:58Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T15:24:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":dancers: :tada: :fireworks: merging ^^\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146902805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146903415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1244#issuecomment-146903415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1244","id":146903415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjkwMzQxNQ==","user":{"login":"vasia","id":498957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia","html_url":"https://github.com/vasia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vasia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T15:27:17Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T15:27:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'll merge this one too.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146903415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/146908658","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1214#issuecomment-146908658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1214","id":146908658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjkwODY1OA==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-09T15:49:58Z","updated_at":"2015-10-09T15:49:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The way we do this with the Optimizer plan is a bit pragmatic.

for the review in advance, @fhueske . Something i want to mention here is that, the range partitioner implementation in this PR follow the existed partitioner design pattern, which in my personal view, is not well designed by the principle of object-oriented programing, the parameters of different partitioners are passed through Flink all together, and all partitioners logic mixed in OutputEmitter, i'm not very satisfied with the implementation in this PR actually. I think we need refactor the partitioner as a followup work, but this should not block this PR. Range partitioner is a little different from other partitioners, with it enabled, we could have a better overview about how to design the abstraction of partitioner. The refactor should require a design doc and fully discussed in community, what do you think about this?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/148290945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/148323391","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1160#issuecomment-148323391","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/1160","id":148323391,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODMyMzM5MQ==","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-15T09:01:01Z","updated_at":"2015-10-15T09:01:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks
