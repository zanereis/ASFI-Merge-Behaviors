In a polymorphic manner basically, meaning that the JDBC module knows best which column naming conventions must be followed for the various JDBC databases and maybe other modules has other conventions to apply to the columns of _their_ datastore types. So having a central ContextType defeats that design principle because then you cannot manage it in the submodules.\n\nAnother remark is that in the JDBC module it even varies amongst different database vendors. We have already plugged in different QueryRewriter classes for the purpose of handling SQL dialects. My suggestion is that in the JDBC module we add another method to the IQueryRewriter interface for normalizing the column names. In the abstract/base class it could then do generic stuff like replacing whitespace with underscore, and maybe in some subclasses it could do more. For instance I think that only a few databases support non-ASCII characters such as \"æøåäöê\" and so on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/104926548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/104927693","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/17#issuecomment-104927693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/17","id":104927693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNDkyNzY5Mw==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-23T17:19:43Z","updated_at":"2015-05-23T17:19:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My worry is still there I am afraid. With the change in CsvDataSet there is now a call to the cast(...) method which casts/narrows the object type on a value-by-value basis. That means that I can very easily be getting values of different types within the same column.\n\nIn my opinion it would be much better if we during the analysis of the data set a ColumnType on the Column definition. And then we _only_ do the casting as per the column type. That way we ensure that it is \"always or never\" that we change the objects we read.\n\nAnother aspect that I'd like to request is that this feature can be turned on or off in CsvConfiguration. For the application that I am working on CSV is one of the most important data source types and we have some cases of processing billions of CSV records. If there is just a single \"foo bar\" value in the middle of such a file with otherwise entirely numbers or so, then we need a way to turn off the casting so that the consumer of the data at least does not get inconsistent value types (or loss of data in case the cast would omit the \"foo bar\" value).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/104927693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/comments/104928231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metamodel/pull/17#issuecomment-104928231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metamodel/issues/17","id":104928231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNDkyODIzMQ==","user":{"login":"kaspersorensen","id":291450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQ1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/kaspersorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaspersorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-23T17:27:23Z","updated_at":"2015-05-23T17:27:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thinking about this some more, I guess the main principle that I am trying to enforce is:\n\n_metadata about a column must be consistent with the values you get when you query that column_\n\nIn other words, it is currently consistent that ColumnType is always STRING because we always return a String value.\n\nI would be very open to a way of working with CSV files where you could specify/override the column type of certain columns. That would actually be a pretty cool feature - very related, but a different way to see it.\n\nIf that would be the case then you could first use the untouched CsvDataContext to analyze the content of various columns. If you feel confident enough you might then switch the column type from STRING to something else. And when it is then set to eg. INTEGER then our cast method should automatically apply a Integer cast/conversion operation.

The CSV data type is not \"typed\", like a data base. It would be nice if the user can impose a data model on top of the CSV file, to express his intention. For example, the CSV file could be a database dump file. The user would then like to declare String, Numerical and Boolean columns.\n\nThe first thing the user wants is then to declare the column types. Detecting column types is much less needed IMHO. The \"foo bar\" would result in a type exception for the row.\n\nNext, we could think about handling exceptional cases like:\n- Handling missing values with some sort of coalesce function to handling missing values;\n- Converting invalid values into some special value;\n\nThis does not conflict with Kaspers notion of changing the column types. But it is a bit less ambitious.
