I can see that [Stephen Conollly's blog post](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/fileinputstream-fileoutputstream-considered-harmful) has gone viral and triggered many projects to review their usage of `FileInputStream` (or `FileOutputStream`). His article was later [published on DZone](https://dzone.com/articles/fileinputstream-fileoutputstream-considered-harmful) were it triggered a minor discussion where Kirk Pepperdine also commented. I don't see Mr Pepperdine disputing that a finalizer causes GC but he seems to argue that it can hardly have that much of an impact. Anyway, that's why it will be interesting to see if there's any real impact on a large code base like NetBeans.\r\n\r\nBottom line: I think we should see some more test results before we begin changing every occurrence of `FileInputStream`. \r\n\r\nInteresting stuff, mdindoffer !","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/347096698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/347138591","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/297#issuecomment-347138591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/297","id":347138591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzEzODU5MQ==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T10:21:07Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T10:21:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/347138591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/347185474","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/294#issuecomment-347185474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/294","id":347185474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzE4NTQ3NA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T13:45:37Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T13:45:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This looks great and is critical for the 9.0 Beta release.

Sure there may be a place for a java hint in the future, but this was partly an experiment.  Also, the code is kinda fragile and tangled up in some places, so I prefer to do this stuff manually.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to apply this change throughout the whole repo in one go, but it proved to be more time consuming than I thought. Yes, the speedup that seems to be present at the boot probably originates from the core. And maybe autoupdate too? If it checks for updates at startup, not entirely sure. However, the point is, if there's a benefit observable in one use case (boot), it should manifest itself in other use cases too, even if negligibly. I also planned to tackle code that touches file searching & replacing and benchmark that. I think the api.search* module (which I plowed through) houses most of the relevant code for this, but not all.

This goes for docs, UI and log messages. \r\n\r\nBtw:  With this change, because of the changed `currentVersion` variable, the name which is printed at the top of the messages log will also change:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSystem Info: \r\n  Product Version         = Apache NetBeans IDE Dev (Build 20171128-unknown-revn)\r\n  ...\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/348293708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/348296064","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/305#issuecomment-348296064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/305","id":348296064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODI5NjA2NA==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T19:33:38Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T19:33:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your input!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/348296064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/348299861","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/262#issuecomment-348299861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/262","id":348299861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODI5OTg2MQ==","user":{"login":"matthiasblaesing","id":2179736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzk3MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2179736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiasblaesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiasblaesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T19:47:21Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T19:47:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The change looks save and in the worst case it masks the underlying bug.

me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/348708535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/348752634","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/316#issuecomment-348752634","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/316","id":348752634,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODc1MjYzNA==","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-03T09:48:50Z","updated_at":"2017-12-03T09:48:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Travis

This is one of those boring tasks that should be done to move forward.\r\n\r\nYep, I took a look at Jan's branch but we were repeating notice files and AFAIK the notices were all the same for all builds. Note that this PR is about the NOTICE file only, not about the rest of licensing/dependencies/whatever (that would require another PR).\r\n\r\nThe expression \"its contents must be analyzed and the relevant portions bubbled up into the top-level NOTICE file\" in the requirements doesn't make sense to me: I need a clear definition of what \"relevant portion\" means. From my point of view, and since I'm not a lawyer, all the content is a \"relevant portion\", otherwise it won't be there.

patch level, it might be better to define a netbeans_default_tmpdir next to netbeans_default_cachedir above.\r\n\r\nI feel conflictual about this fix.\r\n\r\nOn one side, it's good that NetBeans started respecting the OS cache dir. Long ago it did not and it was annoying on macOS, for example, because the user couldn't decide which data is safe to remove (to recover disk space) and which not. I also assume a lot of useless cache got backed up to Time Machine which is not good.\r\n\r\nmacOS is pretty OK about setting (and clearing) the temp folder and it's rarely on another partition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I can see how from a configuration or security standpoint it might be good not to have NetBeans leak files into various folders. But it feels like a user-configuration thing. (2GB for a temp folder doesn't seem like much, I'll compare with my machines).\r\n\r\nSo, speaking of NETBEANS-210 I believe NetBeans should have some better user level message about needing extra disk space (it probably throws some error, no?).\r\n\r\nIn order to help the (minority, I guess, of) users that are in this situation the script could use netbeans_default_tmpdir but initialize it by default with $TMPDIR.\r\n\r\nThus, nothing should change for existing users. But users with smaller $TMPDIRs would just tweak netbeans_default_tmpdir in the script instead of learning about `java.io.tmpdir` and -J-D\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we could even have some UI allowing the user to tweak this folder. Also, add another method to `Places` (http://bits.netbeans.org/8.1/javadoc/org-openide-modules/org/openide/modules/Places.html ) which will be used by modules like the Maven support.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/353310717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/353317803","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/329#issuecomment-353317803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/329","id":353317803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzMxNzgwMw==","user":{"login":"vieiro","id":564140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDE0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/564140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro","html_url":"https://github.com/vieiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vieiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-21T10:36:28Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T10:36:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\n(I've edited the title to see if this sends stuff to JIRA).\r\n\r\nGood points, Emilian, thanks.\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem is with the Maven indexer itself. Instead of trying to fill the java.io.tmpdir until exhaustion and then fail (for those systems where java.io.tmpdir lives in memory this is very bad) it should probably check first if there's enough space to proceed.\r\n\r\nSince that's tough to do in a portable way maybe the best workaround is to have the maven indexer to use Places to create a  specific working directory in the \"cache directory\" and ensure that it's cleaned up once it's done. \r\n\r\nOn startup we could check if that working directory exists (because of previous fatal exit, for instance) and clean it up too.\r\n\r\nThe \"tmp\" partition space is the default Debian installation size, so I assume many Debian users will suffer the problem. I may want to see if Debian derivatives are also affected.
