Provide a per-sensor config option, e.g. inputDataCharset\r\n> \r\n> What is the status of this? I assume the suggestion here to provide additional configuration is a feature enhancement request and not something we would tackle on this PR. Is that right @mmiklavc?\r\n> \r\n> What do we need to do to get this PR merged?\r\n\r\nI thought this could be handled pretty trivially here. What if we modified this ever so slightly to include a default charset for the parsers that can be overridden as needed? Here's an example.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# MessageParser interface\r\n\r\npublic interface MessageParser<T> extends Configurable {\r\n...\r\n    default Charset getReadCharset() {\r\n        return StandardCharsets.UTF_8;\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// then we can do this for the default case\r\n\r\n# CSVParser\r\n\r\npublic class CSVParser extends BasicParser {\r\n...\r\n  @Override\r\n  public List<JSONObject> parse(byte[] rawMessage) {\r\n    try {\r\n      String msg = new String(rawMessage, getReadCharset());\r\n...\r\n\r\n// And for implementations that might want something else\r\n\r\npublic class CSVParser extends BasicParser {\r\n...\r\n  private Charset readCharset;\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void configure(Map<String, Object> parserConfig) {\r\n    converter = new CSVConverter();\r\n    converter.initialize(parserConfig);\r\n    Object tsFormatObj = parserConfig.get(TIMESTAMP_FORMAT_CONF);\r\n    if(tsFormatObj != null) {\r\n      timestampFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(tsFormatObj.toString());\r\n    }\r\n    if (parserConfig.containsKey(READ_CHARSET)) {\r\n      readCharset = Charset.forName((String) parserConfig.get(READ_CHARSET));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Charset getReadCharset() {\r\n    return readCharset != null ? readCharset : super.getReadCharset();\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could even push that config option into the BasicParser if we wanted. The upshot is that this seems like a really trivial change. Rather than opening another PR to address it, can we just add the option with our desired default now and be done with it?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/510235543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/510236538","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1440#issuecomment-510236538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1440","id":510236538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDIzNjUzOA==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T21:30:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T21:30:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 by inspection, thanks @merrimanr!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/510236538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/510248453","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1414#issuecomment-510248453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1414","id":510248453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDI0ODQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T22:06:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T22:06:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks reasonable to me @tiborm, +1 by inspection.

Again, I think this change is a good idea and it's pretty easy to justify imo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/510942417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/510943635","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1341#issuecomment-510943635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1341","id":510943635,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDk0MzYzNQ==","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T16:09:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T16:09:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc Sure, I'll deconflict and get you set up.

Is this okay with you?\r\n\r\nWorks for me","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/511416161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/511426452","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1455#issuecomment-511426452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1455","id":511426452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTQyNjQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"tiborm","id":2437400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0Mzc0MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2437400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm","html_url":"https://github.com/tiborm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiborm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T14:30:11Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T14:30:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 (non-binding) Works as it's expected.

The Alerts UI does not properly display comments when indexing into Elasticsearch.  See screenshot.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-02 at 3 02 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/61329821-3da73700-a7ec-11e9-8e5d-5ee8dc47b887.png)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we serialize comments into Elasticsearch differently than we do Solr.  For Elasticsearch we write the comments as a list of maps.  For Solr, we write a list of JSON strings.  I do not understand why we serialize these differently, but I definitely don't want to change that behavior in this PR.\r\n\r\nWith this change, it wrote the comments as a list of JSON strings for both Solr and Elasticsearch.  When running against Elasticsearch, the Alerts UI is then passed a raw JSON string that it does not know how to handle; hence the\"Invalid Date\" error in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\nTo really fix this, I would need to refactor deeper into the Elasticsearch side of the DAOs and have them also use the `DocumentBuilder` abstraction.  I would also need to add a test to catch this issue.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the PR description we (de)serialize comments in many different places and this should ultimately be cleaned up and more thoroughly tested.  I am going to shelve this refactor for later.  Until then, the minimal necessary fixes to test current behavior is in #1456 .  Its less than ideal, but it gets the job done.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/511993340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/512825347","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1456#issuecomment-512825347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1456","id":512825347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjgyNTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T13:53:20Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T13:53:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like a good start to me.  +1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/512825347/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/512827164","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1456#issuecomment-512827164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1456","id":512827164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjgyNzE2NA==","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-18T13:57:47Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T13:57:47Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This has been merged into `feature/METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1`.

Probably the easiest thing to do here is expose the additional properties in the respective UI configs. So each UI config would have 1..n config details for connections to the other service(s). If you want to tag-team that, maybe @merrimanr or I can walk you through it. Should be pretty easy to test, also - it's either going to work, or it's not, ha.\r\n\r\nThis UI menu approach looks like it has the potential to start moving us towards a more pluggable UI architecture where we have more than just 2 UI services. There has been some loosely guided discussion in the past about microservices as well as containerizing certain components/services. I spoke a bit offline with @merrimanr about this. I'll let him talk about this in more detail, but one option for moving in this direction is to use a gateway to manage the endpoints. Of course, there are other options as well, e.g. web containers have had application isolation for ages now.
