@bharathikannan-zarget could you provide a full sharding rule configurations of your application?\r\n> And do you expect the tables in the shard databases to be exactly the same ? just like:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> db0.user (0-100)\r\n> db1.user(101-200)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI suggest, you can refer to examples/sharding-jdbc-example/other-feature-example/hit-example.\r\n\r\nUse hint strategy to achieve only shard databases.\r\n\r\nThe following configuration may help you:\r\n```\r\nshardingRule:\r\n  tables:\r\n    t_order:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds_${0..1}.t_order\r\n    t_order_item:\r\n      actualDataNodes: ds_${0..1}.t_order_item\r\n  bindingTables:\r\n    - t_order,t_order_item\r\n  broadcastTables:\r\n    - t_address\r\n  \r\n  defaultDatabaseStrategy:\r\n    hint:\r\n      algorithmClassName: org.apache.shardingsphere.example.hint.raw.jdbc.ModuloHintShardingAlgorithm\r\n  defaultTableStrategy:\r\n    none:\r\n```\r\nthen you should implement yourself algorithmClass for
