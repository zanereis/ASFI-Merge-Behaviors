No, this just exposes the `Matrix` type that is present in the new Java `MLContext`.  Here, we return all of the correct types via a simple call to `get()` on a `MLResults` object, including returning the existing `Matrix` type from the new `MLContext` on the Java side.  On the Java side, the new `Matrix` type can already be used for future SystemML scripts, and contains methods for converting to other types, such as a Spark DataFrame.  We simply expose that functionality on the Python side here.

We should just remove the `mllearn` and `mlpipeline` stuff from it, as those components were only added recently.  That way we can deprecate both the Python & Java old `MLContext` APIs, and then remove them in the future.\n2.

Update the package from `SystemML` to `systemml`.  The entire `src/main/python` folder was added from scratch very recently with a new API that is not backwards compatible anyway, and the `mllearn` and `mlpipeline` components were also added recently after the previous release, we won't break anything, and will be more Pythonic in the process.\n2. Remove the `MLResults.getDataFrame` and replace usages of `getDataFrame(\"matrixName\")` with `get(\"matrixName\").toDF()`.  This way, the API stays clean and simple for an end user, and will help with the upcoming merge of `Matrix` and `matrix`.  Keeping only `get()` makes it simple to get a mixture of datatypes out of a DML script at the same time. [See below example]\n3. Remove the `MLResults.getNumPyArray`, add a `Matrix.toArray()` function on the Java and Python sides (returning a list in Python), add a `Matrix.toNumPyArray()` on the Python side, and replace usages of `getNumPyArray(\"matrixName\")` with `get(\"matrixName\").toNumPyArray()`.  @deroneriksson should be able to assist with adding this on the Java side.  Once again, this will keep the API clean, help the upcoming merge, and keeping only `get()` makes it simple to get a mixture of datatypes out of a DML script at the same time.\n4.  Merge `Matrix` with `matrix`, keeping the later name.\n\nOverall, I'm excited for the direction the Python API is moving! 👍 \n\nExample of using `get()` for mixed datatypes (scalars, matrices, strings, etc):\n\n``` python\nfrom SystemML import MLContext, dml\n\nrdd1 = sc.parallelize([\"1.0,2.0\", \"3.0,4.0\"])\n\nsums = \"\"\"\ns1 = sum(m1)\nm2 = m1 * 2\nt = \"whatever\"\n\"\"\"\n\nml = MLContext(sc)\nscript = dml(sums).input(m1=rdd1).out(\"s1\", \"m2\", \"t\")\ns1, m2, t = ml.execute(script).get(\"s1\", \"m2\", \"t\")\ns1, m2, t\n```\n\nReturns:\n\n``` python\n(10.0, Matrix, 'whatever')\n```\n\nThen, \n\n``` python\nm2.toDF()\n```\n\nReturns\n\n``` python\nDataFrame[ID: double, C1: double, C2: double]\n```\n\nAdditionally, the `Matrix` `m2` can be used directly as input in a subsequent script.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/242934950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/242936970","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/197#issuecomment-242936970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/197","id":242936970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjkzNjk3MA==","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-27T19:44:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-27T19:44:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"+1 for all 4 points.

The MLContext class contains an ExplainLevel enum that is basically a wrapper of the Explain class's ExplainType enum. The reason that ExplainLevel exists is so that it is in the same package as all the other main MLContext classes. Because of this, it allows a single import (import org.apache.sysml.api.mlcontext._) to handle all MLContext classes, rather than needing to do multiple imports to use the MLContext API. This is very handy from a Scala perspective using SystemML from a Spark Shell.\n\nThe ExplainLevel values are uppercased as a Java enum convention. This allows Java/Scala developers to recognize these as 'constant' values. So, the uppercase format is useful when doing enums from Java or Scala, mostly as a convention.\n\nHowever, for Python, if these are being treated as strings, maybe you could support both uppercase and lowercase strings to prevent case errors? That way you can match both the command-line flags and have symmetry with the Java/Scala.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/243555545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/243559639","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/227#issuecomment-243559639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/227","id":243559639,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzU1OTYzOQ==","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T19:57:32Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T19:57:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Awesome, thanks for finding a fix for this, @deroneriksson.

@asurve. Adding Frame support to the MLContext API is a great addition to the project! I just finished reviewing the PR and made some notes below. Overall this is great.\n\nLGTM. I think the best strategy is to merge and then maybe we can address some of the potential issues and improvements? Perhaps you could fix 2 and 5 below and then merge?\n\n---\n\n1) MLContext InternalProxy (lines 380:425)\nCould you make a note to check with Matthias or Niketan to see if any updates need to be made here for frames?\n\n2) MLContextConversionUtil line 373\ndataFrameToFramexObject to dataFrameToFrameObject (as Mike mentioned).\n\n3) MLContextConversionUtil\nI think we will probably need to create something like a FrameMetadata class and a FrameFormat enum. MatrixMetadata is being used for Frame metadata, and since a Frame is a different entity, it should probably have its own associated metadata and format classes.\n\nDoes Frame internally use MatrixCharacteristics or does it need to have something like its own FrameCharacteristics class? If it uses something like MatrixCharacteristics, we could still have a FrameMetadata act as its wrapper at the API level.\n\n4) MLContextConversionUtil\nFor frameObjectToListStringIJV and frameObjectToListStringCSV, since types such as Strings are allowed, there might need to be some fancier character escaping (or surrounding double quotes with quotes escaped inside) or something like that.\n\n5) MLContextConversionUtil\nCould getSparkContext and getJavaSparkContext methods be private scope? Either that or move them to MLContextUtil?\n\n6) MLContextUtil\nThe convertInputType takes a boolean flag but I've tried to avoid boolean flags in the API. Perhaps we can solve this using a FrameMetadata class in the future.\n\n7) MLResults\nWe might want to create a Frame wrapper class similar to the Matrix wrapper class. We could have MLResults getFrame() method return a Frame object, similar to the getMatrix() method that returns a Matrix object.\n\n8) MLResults\nWe need to be careful with methods such as the ones that take in delimiter strings. If we have multiple values like this and we don't encapsulate them, the API potentially becomes more difficult to use. It is a nice feature to have though.\n\n10) Script\nThe inputVariablesType map and the boolean flag on the in() method are functional but I think a cleaner option may be to have classes/enums for Frame, FrameMetadata, and FrameFormat.\n\n11) MLContextTest\nSince the additional tests all concern frame tests and the tests are coded in a different format than all the existing tests, perhaps they could be moved to a new MLContextFrameTest class?\n\ncc @dusenberrymw @bertholdreinwald @frreiss
