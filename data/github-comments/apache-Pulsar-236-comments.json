- Thanks for the prompt reply. I am looking at http://pulsar.apache.org/api/client/2.2.0/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ConsumerBase.html for documentation of the interface you mentioned - but unfortunately I could not find any further information on the usage of the API - for instance how to build the Messages object / if it is similar to java Collection. Can you please point me to any documentation on this interface?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/664141511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/664151014","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7670#issuecomment-664151014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7670","id":664151014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDE1MTAxNA==","user":{"login":"sijie","id":1217863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie","html_url":"https://github.com/sijie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T06:41:31Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T06:41:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/664151014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/664160181","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7552#issuecomment-664160181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7552","id":664160181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDE2MDE4MQ==","user":{"login":"gaoran10","id":15029908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDI5OTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15029908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10","html_url":"https://github.com/gaoran10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoran10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T07:02:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:02:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"/pulsarbot run-failure-checks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/664160181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/664201837","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/7671#issuecomment-664201837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7671","id":664201837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDIwMTgzNw==","user":{"login":"Jennifer88huang-zz","id":47805623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODA1NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47805623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jennifer88huang-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jennifer88huang-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T08:33:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T08:33:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems that we could not fill date in the calendar.

You can call the RESTful API directly or use `pulsar-admin` to unsubscribe a subscription. With that being said, both tools and API are available for you to use.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, `pulsar-admin` and `pulsar-client` are shipped together as part of the Pulsar binary release. You can get both of the tools out of the box. I don't see the case that users would have access to `pulsar-client` tool but not `pulsar-admin` tool. Step back, even we can add a new command in `pulsar-client`. The `unsubscribe` command will still be protected by access control. You need permissions to call this API no matter the command is in `pulsar-client` or `pulsar-admin`. Hope this clarifies your question on \"Users without access to the admin interface can unsubscribe\".\r\n\r\n> check that messages are flowing on a topic and they do not intend the subscription to persist. On our Pulsar test cluster we often see backlogs on subscriptions that were started with the CLI and the user neglected to unsubscribe.\r\n\r\nIf you are talking about adding a non-durable subscription option to `client consume` command, I think that's a good idea to me. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/665222159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/665225779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7679#issuecomment-665225779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7679","id":665225779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTIyNTc3OQ==","user":{"login":"kjaggann","id":59704044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzA0MDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59704044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann","html_url":"https://github.com/kjaggann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjaggann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-28T19:14:25Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T19:14:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@merlimat \r\ni dont see any thing in the broker logs as this topic is trying to connect to this broker \"i-073b64a162d0c2a1dfdadfda.ebiz.abc.com\"  which is not in the list \r\n\r\ni checked the zookeeper stats \r\n\r\nWatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type:None path:null\r\ncZxid = 0x1234fff70\r\nctime = Tue Jul 14 12:10:36 EDT 2020\r\nmZxid = 0x1234fff70\r\nmtime = Tue Jul 14 12:10:36 EDT 2020\r\npZxid = 0x1234fff70\r\ncversion = 0\r\ndataVersion = 0\r\naclVersion = 0\r\nephemeralOwner = 0x1000070456b3b87\r\ndataLength = 306\r\nnumChildren = 0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/665225779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
