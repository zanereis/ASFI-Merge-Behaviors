Curator that we can distinguish different Curator instance. Also using connection string cannot distinguish different instances which are using the same connection string. It would be nice if we allow the users to pass in the client id when initialize the CuratorFrameworkFactory. In the future, this information may also be used as the connection identity for auth or throttling.</p>\n\n<p>What's your ideas, <a
