After looking more closely at `DateUtils.getDateFormat(format, timezoneID)` it makes sense that the test in question would behave differently based on the system default timezone.  I pushed an update to `TestDataTypeUtils` that changes the test to use `DateUtils.getDateFormat(format)`, which implicitly sets the `DateFormat` time zone to GMT.  This should avoid failures due to system differences and also test the implicit behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754765641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/754772546","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4563#issuecomment-754772546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4563","id":754772546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDc3MjU0Ng==","user":{"login":"moranr","id":14202495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjAyNDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14202495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr","html_url":"https://github.com/moranr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moranr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-05T17:14:33Z","updated_at":"2021-01-05T17:14:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@markap14 @NissimShiman \r\nI don’t think the tabular like appearance is necessary. Much like Start Date/Time, etc. these are just other fields upon which the user can search. I would suggest listing them out in the same format as the others. Then, per applicable field, include a checkbox option to perform the inverse query action.

I did notice a typo on the `records.count` attribute, I will change that on merge to read `record.count` for consistency with other record-based processors. Also it's interesting that if the fields used in EL in the query aren't defined fields in the input record, it went through correctly (possibly because a `null` or empty string was inserted and no results were returned from the otherwise-valid query). Might want to look into this as a follow-on to see if there's a way to detect whether a field is unset or set to null.\r\n\r\nThanks for the improvements!

As you mentioned, I removed some code that overrode configuration from the previous PR because I don't believe it's consistent with the rest of NiFi. Generally, if something is not configured right, things won't start. I did not think we should take the connection string port and attach that as the secure port being used by the embedded server, and rather instead I think things should fail. I'll have another commit available soon which should address some of the above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/761161322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/761278552","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4167#issuecomment-761278552","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4167","id":761278552,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTI3ODU1Mg==","user":{"login":"walmut","id":48774116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Nzc0MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48774116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut","html_url":"https://github.com/walmut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walmut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-16T00:55:46Z","updated_at":"2021-01-16T00:55:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@humpfhumpf the conflicts has been resolved.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/761278552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/761870143","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4709#issuecomment-761870143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4709","id":761870143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTg3MDE0Mw==","user":{"login":"CefBoud","id":28169169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTY5MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28169169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud","html_url":"https://github.com/CefBoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CefBoud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-17T19:56:48Z","updated_at":"2021-01-17T19:56:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thank you for the insightful review @exceptionfactory.

Enabling INFO was something I raised because we included non-exception logging in some of our scripts then took a while to realise why INFO statements weren't being included in our logs.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't wanted behaviour, then fair enough, it can be left for individuals to enable INFO logging for the included processors that don't otherwise have it enabled by default (but the included logback.xml means some processors/controllers don't output INFO while others do - this PR doesn't necessarily rationalise all of them, but would for the scripted components at least).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/763068680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/763087937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4761#issuecomment-763087937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4761","id":763087937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MzA4NzkzNw==","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-19T19:50:54Z","updated_at":"2021-01-19T19:50:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Split record indeed logs stuff like record counts at the INFO level, but the default logback.xml settings should suppress those like they would with any other processor.

I agree that probably means that adding INFO for `ExecuteGroovyScript` by default starts to make less sense too. Maybe there should be an addition to the documentation for scripted components indicating that while they have the `log` component available, the default `logback.xml` config won't output anything below WARN?
