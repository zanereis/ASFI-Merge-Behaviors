I think \"Advanced proposal 2\" is a much better way to solve this. My reasoning is that, from the NodeJS action writer's perspective, they can and should assume that each time their action runs, they get a nice clean state of memory. You and I know that is not necessarily true due to warm container reuse that is specific to OpenWhisk but this really shouldn't, in my opinion, be a concern for the action writer.\r\n\r\nI think the logical end to making the action writer responsible for handling garbage collection is that they will end up calling `global.gc()` \"just in case\" which incurs the time penalty during their action invocation when it may not really be needed. For example, they didn't use enough memory to warrant it, or they aren't invoking the action often enough to benefit from warm container reuse, etc.\r\n\r\nI believe that we can make the NodeJS runtime start garbage collection automatically on behalf of the user without penalizing their action invocation time. This could be done by calling the `gc()` function in a `setTimeout` callback just before completing the `/run` request. This _should_ allow the `/run` route to complete while putting the garbage collection operation on the stack for later execution.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like this: https://github.com/bjustin-ibm/openwhisk/blob/991e2955d7c82cce5c0042a068ecc7125d8f47fb/core/nodejsActionBase/src/service.js#L115","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278378740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278382535","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/issues/1819#issuecomment-278382535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1819","id":278382535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODM4MjUzNQ==","user":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T16:39:32Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T16:39:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@markusthoemmes will this go away when you nuke namespaces?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278382535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278383733","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1790#issuecomment-278383733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1790","id":278383733,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODM4MzczMw==","user":{"login":"markusthoemmes","id":1289147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes","html_url":"https://github.com/markusthoemmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markusthoemmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T16:42:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T16:42:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@csantanapr not a fan at all.

I then added automatic garbage collection into the NodeJS runtime as proposed above (the `setTimeout` approach), and then ran \"eatNoGC\" 10 times within 30 seconds, again recording the invocation times.\r\n\r\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7012682/22752551/f44c2a44-ee06-11e6-9b37-7db0ebded3c7.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd then ignoring the outlier 822ms eatManualGC run:\r\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7012682/22752606/2800e050-ee07-11e6-8bad-194239de467d.jpg)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Jeremias' new action limits test passes with automatic garbage collection and the \"eatNoGC\" version of `memory.js`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/compare/master...bjustin-ibm:node_gc","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278440306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278446497","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1754#issuecomment-278446497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1754","id":278446497,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQ0NjQ5Nw==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T20:08:55Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T20:08:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lzbj, please get access for PGs.

I know you cannot be surprised by this.   ;-)    I was using `node --v8-options`.\r\n\r\n@jeremiaswerner  As Nick indirectly alluded to, one can try to set a heap size limit and allow node's scheduling to limit memory consumption.   This is \"correct\" approach if V8 had exposed the correct flags.  GC (and their authors) tend to be lazy and so it will not garbage collect until it hits the limit.  For V8, I believe the default is 1.7GB.   So if use `--max_old_space_size`, we can try to limit and cause node to schedule the GC itself.  This is not foolproof because there are at least 4 spaces V8 uses:  code space, semi-spaces (often referred to as the nursery), old-space (sometimes called tenured space), and LOS (large-object space).  I don't know the threshold (probably around 1-4MB), but arrays over this size are directly allocated here.  The unfortunate part is that V8 currently provides no flag to control this.  I speculate if you change your test program to allocating smaller objects - say make 1000 1KB arrays instead of a single 1MB, then the memory limit would work.\r\n\r\nAs for the observed 300ms, this is because NodeJS is a copying generational collector so the time it spends is due to a fixed overhead, time to process the thread stacks, and to then trace through the live objects.  In your program (and in ones with no memory leaks), this amount will be small and that's why it's \"only\" 300 ms.   Actually, 300ms is pretty horrible for a generational system with a nearly empty heap.  (I used to write GCs.)\r\n \r\nI would use the flag to mitigate non-large objects.   This would require a bit of invoker work though as we have no flag differentiation mechanism at the moment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278448326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/278451159","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/1790#issuecomment-278451159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/1790","id":278451159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQ1MTE1OQ==","user":{"login":"csantanapr","id":1094878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1094878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr","html_url":"https://github.com/csantanapr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csantanapr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-08T20:26:35Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T20:26:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">@csantanapr not a fan at all.
