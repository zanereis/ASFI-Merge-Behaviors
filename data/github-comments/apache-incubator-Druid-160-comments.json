This will all be hidden inside an `Allocator` abstraction from which rest of druid (queries for example) would request memory.\r\n\r\nBiggest problem in such scenario is  to deal with fragmentation. One options is that `Allocator` would allow giving off chunks of only two possible sizes (say, 4MB and 64K, these sizes could be made configurable if necessary). That way there is no fragmentation problem as you can keep giving chunks of 64K from head of big memory block and chunks of 4MB from tail of the big memory block.\r\nDruid query implementations should be adjusted to work within this constraint. For example GroupByQuery hash table implementation shouldn't assume that a big  1-2 G block of memory is available but rather a list of 4MB memory chunks (not contiguous in address space) can be requested from `Allocator` , same goes for TopN query etc. This might also require us to put limits on how big one single row could be e.g. it can't get bigger than 4MB.\r\n64K (smaller size) chunks would be used for temporary decompression buffers etc.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333153203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333203124","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4852#issuecomment-333203124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4852","id":333203124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzIwMzEyNA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T18:29:19Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T18:29:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: aside from minor comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333203124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333215196","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4422#issuecomment-333215196","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4422","id":333215196,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzIxNTE5Ng==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T19:19:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T19:19:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> \"big block of memory\" could be a list of ByteBuffer objects of 2G each or a big Memory object.\r\n\r\nNo, the problem is that it must be just one continuous block of memory, not a list of blocks.

Especially since JS is not meant to be super optimized for production, and with this patch, we're just trying to make it slightly more robust for a specific case we ran into.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333594621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333595346","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/4886#issuecomment-333595346","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4886","id":333595346,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzU5NTM0Ng==","user":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T16:55:13Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T16:55:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@himanshug in the long term/general, what do you think about Druid to be \"weakly typed\", a-la MySQL, vs \"strongly typed\", a-la PostgreSQL?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333595346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333598946","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4887#issuecomment-333598946","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4887","id":333598946,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzU5ODk0Ng==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T17:08:11Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T17:08:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chinseone, result manipulations like this are currently not supported.

See IdentifierExpr + how it handles strings that are treated as numbers. But with direct column selectors the behavior is (1). In particular this means that e.g. a longSum aggregator behaves differently if it's `\"fieldName\" : \"x\"` vs. `\"expression\" : \"x\"` even though you might think they should behave the same.\r\n\r\nAlthough, on the third hand, dimensions behave differently from aggregators. They act more like (3). There's some code that sets up the \"proper\" column selector that matches the type in the segment, and groups using that seelctor on a per-segment basis, then uses the user-specified `\"outputType\"` only for merging results. So you can group on a string column with `\"outputType\" : \"long\"` and the strings will be parsed as numbers during the merging phase. This is mostly done through ColumnSelectorStrategyFactory impls in the groupBy and topN engines.\r\n\r\nIMO, making (3) consistent across the board would be good. I don't think (2) or (4) are good, it's not in the spirit of Druid being a generally \"loose schema\" data store. IMO (3) is preferable to (1) since it enables easy schema changes from string -> numeric type and vice versa. This was the motivator for making groupBY/topN behave the way they do: it was introduced along with the numeric dimension feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333610705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/333614715","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4841#issuecomment-333614715","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4841","id":333614715,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzYxNDcxNQ==","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-02T18:00:53Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T18:00:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hm, what happens if you replace the 1.7.4 jars under hadoop-aws with the 1.10.77 jars?\r\n\r\n@b-slim @himanshug Any thoughts on this issue?
