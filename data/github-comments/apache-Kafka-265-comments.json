The `appendToLogCallback` occurs on the `InterBrokerSendThread` when the `TransactionMarkerRequestCompletionHandler` calls `txnMarkerChannelManager.completeSendMarkersForTxnId(transactionalId)` which tries to complete the operation via purgatory.\r\nChanging this to a loop means that `InterBrokerSendThread` is blocked until this operation completes. Also, i needed to remove the `txnMetadata synchronized {...}` from  `DelayedTnxMarker` as this would result in there being a deadlock when `TransactionStateManager.updateCacheCallback` tries to also synchronize on the `txnMetadata`.

thought about this a little more and have another proposal. Instead of wrapping around the epoch, we can let the TC generate a new producerId. The only catch is that we need to ensure that we can always fence the previous producer. This means we need to ensure that the TC always has at least one epoch in its back pocket to use for fencing. So we can ensure that the TC only allocates up to `Short.MaxValue - 1` and uses `Short.MaxValue` only for fencing. When the client sends InitProducerId and the current epoch is `Short.MaxValue - 1`, we will fence the current producer using `Short.MaxValue` and assign a new producerId to the new producer. I discussed this with @guozhangwang and @apurvam and it seems like this can

And since this single thread is responsible for sending all requests to all brokers, it should just continuously loop invoking on the underlying network client and avoid any blocking logic. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if we can do it in a similar way of handling `broker unknown` issue, that is after all the txn markers has been done, try appending to local log once, and if that failed put that into a separate queue so that in the next iteration it will retry append. By doing this the thread iteration will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhile (running) {\r\n\r\n// following are wrapped in the doWork() call\r\n\r\n1. check the yet-to-append queue, and try once to append them, if failed again re-enqueue.\r\n2. check the unknown broker markers queue, and try once to get their broker, if still unknown re-enqueue.\r\n3. invoke network client poll call to do network IO.\r\n4. handle response from the network IO, try append if necessary and if failed enqueue to the yet-to-append.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that all step 1/2/4 are light and non blocking. We should consider also adding a metric for these two yet-to-append and unknown-broker queues to alert if it grows infinitely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305592461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305594179","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3194#issuecomment-305594179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3194","id":305594179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTU5NDE3OQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-01T19:22:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T19:22:03Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

agree that we should have tests for `close`. It's bad that there aren't any yet. I am happy that the class is going away given how few tests there are for it.\r\n\r\nA separate question is how `close` methods are tested. If we add a test that verifies that every resource in every `Closeable` is actually closed by a `close` method, we'll be adding a lot of tests (we have very few tests that do that, I wrote one of them). Cost/benefit ratio is a bit unclear, but it may be worth having a discussion about (I think the biggest value would be to ensure that people think about what needs to be closed when writing the code in the first place).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305623709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/305623847","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3195#issuecomment-305623847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3195","id":305623847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTYyMzg0Nw==","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-01T21:19:36Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T21:19:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"A
