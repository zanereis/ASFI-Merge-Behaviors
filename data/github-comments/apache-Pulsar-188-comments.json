As far as I know, \"close consumer\" will not close a multiplexed connection. I am trying to understand what you have observed before.\r\n\r\nI guess \"connection\" here should not be used as the underlying TCP connection is kept open, rather \"session\". On reset, Pulsar will close every session. So, the problem is:\r\n\r\n1. we have N (where N > 1) \"read sessions\" open\r\n2. on initialization, the logic performs \"seek\" operation, so that it starts reading from the offset recorded externally\r\n3. *every* session gets closed when *any* of the sessions performs the seek\r\n4.
