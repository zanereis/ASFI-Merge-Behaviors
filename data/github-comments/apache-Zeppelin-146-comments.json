@andreaTP , @1ambda , @felixcheung \r\n\r\n@andreaTP , I confused everyone with soft-coding the npm value. \"npm\" is the npm package name. So it should remain hard-coded.\r\n\r\n@1ambda , thanks for your help. It's my first pull request so might have some issues with the CI. Answering your question, I believe I forked from zeppelin as I'm making the pull request from nokia (remote) / zeppelin (repo) / zeppelin2214 (branch). Let me know if I'm still missing something.\r\n\r\n@felixcheung , @1ambda , ignore Npm registry repo. Latest version has now soft-coded Node registry, NPM registry and YARN registry. Node and Yarn are repositories, not registries, but with a repository manager, they become registry paths.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/302660589/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/302695547","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/932#issuecomment-302695547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/932","id":302695547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMjY5NTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"sohaibiftikhar","id":5103613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDM2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar","html_url":"https://github.com/sohaibiftikhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-19T12:56:48Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T15:51:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jongyoul I wish to open a dependent pull request for review.
