I could also add quick instructions on how to stop/start a machine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/271008460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/271010036","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/393#issuecomment-271010036","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/393","id":271010036,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTAxMDAzNg==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T21:19:40Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T21:20:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":" \r\n \r\n  `value=$(VBoxManage list vms | grep -ic \"metron-machine\" )\r\n  if [ $value -eq 1 ]\r\n  then\r\n      VBoxManage startvm \"metron-machine\" --type headless                    \r\n  fi`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/271010036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/271010647","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/393#issuecomment-271010647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/393","id":271010647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTAxMDY0Nw==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-06T21:21:34Z","updated_at":"2017-01-06T21:22:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I don't think we can assume that dev's will just leave it up and running.

At a high level I was thinking that any exception that bubbled up through the controller should be mapped to an error response.

The benefits I see from doing this are keeping the error handling consistent, separating concerns, and giving better feedback to the end user.

Regarding multiple optional args, I followed the rule that if the second optional arg is provided, then the first \"optional\" arg isn't optional; or more generally, if a later optional arg is provided, all preceding optional args must also be provided, even if with trivial values.  No tricky polymorphisms with object types, just a simple argument count. I think that's the best we can do without named arguments.\r\n\r\nBTW, @cestella , my previous PR-345 did use object type checking to allow either or both to be truly optional, but it felt very hacky, was obviously not generalizable, and I was happy to change to this.\r\n\r\nHopefully I made this clear for users in both the comments and documents.  Let me know if you feel more needs to be said.

Looking at that file, it appears that ambari is explicitly providing the ability to modify the global config and certain flux topology properties files, but not a screen to manage the sensor-specific configuration content (i.e. at present parsers and enrichment).  Please correct if I have had a reading comprehension SNAFU ;)  If so, since we just added a new set of configs under the same config directory and provided hooks for `zk_load_utils.sh` to know how to load and get them, it shouldn't be any different than the existing configs.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it is a good point you make.  Let me restate it and you tell me if I have the gist.

As best I can tell, this is _only_ applicable to the global config, not the individual topology json configs. Those are unpacked on install via Ambari performing an RPM install, but not actually managed on an ongoing basis. The way you get into hot water here is if you've chosen to manage Ambari configs in a different directory than where Ambari believes they're located, due to it using zk_load_configs.sh under the hood. Even then, this is parameterized via `metron_zookeeper_config_path`. I can't recall if that path is absolute, relative, or both. But in metron-env it's defaulted to `config/zookeeper`\r\n\r\nHope this clarifies some things.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/272293773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/272294113","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/415#issuecomment-272294113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/415","id":272294113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjI5NDExMw==","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-12T21:47:28Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T21:47:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@cestella Yeah, if we do a CONFIG_PUT via the Stellar REPL without updating the local file system config copy, that's going to cause syncing problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/272294113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/comments/272295408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/415#issuecomment-272295408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/415","id":272295408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjI5NTQwOA==","user":{"login":"dlyle65535","id":3439113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzkxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3439113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535","html_url":"https://github.com/dlyle65535","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dlyle65535/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-12T21:52:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T21:52:33Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mmiklavc - doesn't Enrichment Master's config do the same thing for enrichment.properties?\r\n\r\n\r\n        File(format(\"{metron_config_path}/enrichment.properties\"),\r\n             content=Template(\"enrichment.properties.j2\"),\r\n             owner=params.metron_user,\r\n             group=params.metron_group\r\n             )`\r\n\r\nAnd Indexing Master handles elasticsearch.properties (and global.json)?\r\n\r\n\r\n    File(\"{0}/global.json\".format(params.metron_zookeeper_config_path),\r\n         owner=params.metron_user,\r\n         content=InlineTemplate(params.global_json_template)\r\n         )\r\n\r\n    File(\"{0}/elasticsearch.properties\".format(params.metron_zookeeper_config_path + '/..'),\r\n         owner=params.metron_user,\r\n         content=InlineTemplate(params.global_properties_template))`\r\n\r\nThat was my intention anyway.

For example, let's say a developer is integrating with the Metron API. For some reason they want to drop all error responses on a queue for processing by another system. If the status code didn't exist in the error format some context would be lost. But to your point maybe it doesn't buy us much. I don't have a strong preference either way on this one. However, maybe at some point it may be worth having a custom attribute called `code` that would allow a user to look up the errors in documentation. It could potentially show things like common causes and workarounds.

The docs are solid, and I like the configurability of the batch size and frequency. And the quicker deploy time is definitely a plus. Is that because we're no longer deploying the sensors by default?

But if we're saving 14 minutes in the Vagrant deployment, I could be convinced otherwise. And the more I think about it, you could just run the Ansible role for the sensors which is easy enough.
