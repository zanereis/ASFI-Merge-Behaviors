The FedPlan and FedVariant classes are retained to avoid redundant cost calculations.\r\n2. The Cost Enumerator already supports multiple child FedPlans (two or more), and no modifications were made.\r\n\r\n#### Discussion Points\r\n1. In the current test code, the _outputMemEstimate is initialized to -1, leading to incorrect memory access and network cost calculations, which produce an invalid FedPlan. This needs to be fixed.\r\n2. If necessary, we may need to verify that all operations in the federated plans correctly set _outputMemEstimate or update the Cost Estimator to account for such exceptional

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work? Only paid users can view reports and post statuses/comments.

If there's a need to print each `additionalCost` individually, feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\n4. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: \r\n- Previously, the `detectAndResolveConflictFedPlan` function would enumerate a conflict `fedPlan` as both LOUT and FOUT, even after detecting a conflict. This could lead to incorrect, unnecessary, and duplicate detection and resolution of conflicts for the `fedPlan` and its child `fedPlans`. \r\n\r\n- For example, it might mistakenly identify a non-conflict `fedPlan` as having conflicts due to shared `HopID` among parent `FedPlans`, or it might incorrectly flag a `fedPlan` with a single parent as having a conflict. \r\n\r\n- To address this, we now store the `fedPlans` where conflicts occur and exclude these `fedPlans` and their child `fedPlans` from the BFS target. After BFS completes, we resolve the collected conflicts and then perform BFS again on the resolved `fedPlans` and their children.\r\n\r\n5. **Bug Fixes in resolveConflictFedPlan**: Fixed bugs in the `resolveConflictFedPlan` implementation.\r\n\r\n6. **Test Enhancements**: Added if-else DML test script for `FederatedPlanCostEnumeratorTest`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2585396191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/comments/2585400119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/pull/2175#issuecomment-2585400119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/2175","id":2585400119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOArxUbc6aGhM3","user":{"login":"min-guk","id":87025898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87025898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk","html_url":"https://github.com/min-guk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/min-guk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-11T20:34:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T20:34:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"However, the current detect-and-resolve approach resolves conflicts from top to bottom, which poses a risk of producing inaccurate results because it resolves conflicts higher up while lower-level conflicts are still present.\n\nI understand that this is not an ideal approach, but I am struggling to come up with an appropriate solution to address this issue.
