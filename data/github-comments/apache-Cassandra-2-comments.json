@piyushknoldus Thank you for the patch. We had a *very* detailed page about gossip at one point, but that did not survive the transfer to the new site for some reason.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to try going through https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureGossip and updating (a few things have changed) as well as formatting for RST, that would be quite helpful and an excellent way to go through the current code base and learn more.

?\r\n\r\n`switchCompactionLocation(..)` is a public method and can be called from other places, when rows need to now be written to a new sstable in a new location. That's why [here](https://github.com/thelastpickle/cassandra/commit/a34a72391bb2847b3bd6ed93b4306199ddf3a991#diff-19359d40a9c932efdebc62a067ed4390R40) i paired writers by their location, so if a location changes the writer can also change.\r\n\r\n> > Marcus' original idea was to create only two sstables per TWCS window.\r\n>\r\n> Currently it will create up to \"minThreshold\" sstables 窶ｦ\r\n\r\nI'm not too sure I get that. The code you referenced is about which bucket is up for compaction, not how many writers to use during a bucket's compaction.\r\nMarcus' idea was to only create two sstables per bucket, one that contains all the rows that belong in the bucket, and another for old data that's been streamed in late. Therefore `SplittingTimeWindowCompactionWriter. writersByBounds` should be a fixed array of size 2. The splitting approach as describe in  `SplittingTimeWindowCompactionWriter`'s class apidoc: splitting in half, then half, down to 50Mb; is quite different to the original idea.\r\n\r\n> > shouldn't the bucket be based of the maxTimestamp? see `getBuckets(..)` and `newestBucket(..)`\r\n>\r\n> getBuckets() currently use maxTimestamp, , which isn't available (currently) in the compaction task\r\n\r\n@krummas ?\r\n\r\n> Are you talking about sstables generated before this patch ?\r\n\r\nYes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/328245507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/comments/328409922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/129#issuecomment-328409922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cassandra/issues/129","id":328409922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODQwOTkyMg==","user":{"login":"Fuud","id":283980,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Mzk4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/283980?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud","html_url":"https://github.com/Fuud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fuud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-11T04:03:37Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T04:03:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"eb717f1 has been merged and CASSANDRA-13652 is closed.

It appears that @bdeggleston also noticed this in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-14091 (a week or so after your patch). Unfortunately, I don't think anyone noticed your patch, probably because we don't typically use Github PRs (ASF repo isn't writable on github, so we can't merge this PR directly) - our contribution workflow is through JIRA. Appreciate the contribution, sorry we didn't see it in time.
