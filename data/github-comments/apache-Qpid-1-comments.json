So you would either need to reimplement condvars to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC (SYSTEM_CLOCK?) or go back to using CLOCK_REALTIME in the OSX port.\n\nThe reason we changed to CLOCK_MONOTONIC in the first instance is that CLOCK_REALTIME can go backwards if the system time is changed and this has bad effects on qpid. If OSX/Mach CALENDAR_CLOCK can't go backwards then this isn't important, I expect that, given its name, it can go back though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/qpid/issues/comments/170631466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/qpid/issues/comments/228055684","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/qpid/pull/9#issuecomment-228055684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/qpid/issues/9","id":228055684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODA1NTY4NA==","user":{"login":"mbroadst","id":312966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst","html_url":"https://github.com/mbroadst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbroadst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-23T13:49:14Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T13:49:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@grs here is the amqp10-based test case:\n\n```\n'use strict';\nconst amqp = require('amqp10'),\n      Policy = amqp.Policy,\n      expect = require('chai').expect,\n      config = { address: 'localhost' };\n\nlet test = {};\ndescribe('modified', () => {\n  afterEach(() => test.client.disconnect().then(() => { delete test.client;
