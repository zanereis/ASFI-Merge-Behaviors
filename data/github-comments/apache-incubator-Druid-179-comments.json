S3N is not maintained except for security risks —this helps guarantee security. Most bug reports against S3N will be closed as WONTFIX and the text \"use S3A\". Please switch to S3A if you can -and do try it before filing bug reports against S3N.\r\n\r\nIf only new features are not being added to S3N, I think it's fine. But, if there are some bugs, using S3N for Hadoop 2.7 won't work. @b-slim do you have any idea about this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/370634642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/370635125","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5471#issuecomment-370635125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5471","id":370635125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDYzNTEyNQ==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-06T02:03:51Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T02:03:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Great!

I've been wanting this for a long time and tried to raise awareness for it. This feature is definitely needed. I don't even understand how one can do without it.\r\nI read the comments from the previous proposal.\r\nLet me add a few things to those.\r\n* It was being said that the idea of such a mechanism isn't new and it was mentioned that Vertica has a similar feature named \"projections\". In Vertica, projections have the same number of rows as the original table. So same same but different. The actual prior art would be OLAP. Many databased call themselves OLAP although they are missing every feature of it. These derived datasources in OLAP terms are called cuboids. And yes, it DOES speed up queries and no it is NOT an option to just add more hardware to the query layer. We have a Druid cluster which is dramatically slow because we need to have many dimensions. If a user makes a wide query and trillions of rows need to be scanned, even a large Druid cluster will need minutes to complete that query. The current caching mechanisms will not help with that. How would I scale up the cluster? If a given query takes one minute to execute I would need to make my cluster 60 times bigger to get the query to subsecond latency.\r\nIt was being said that people are manually reindexing secondary datasources. However, this becomes quite unfeasible very quickly. How to make sure that query results are consistent?\r\nThis heavy lifting should be done by a database system for exactly that purpose that it then isn't required anymore for everyone using the database to do the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\n@zhangxinyu1 as I already said, I have invested a lot of thought on bringing this feature to Druid already. I so far always referred to this feature as \"Datasource Delegation\". Lets stick our heads together to figure this out.\r\nThe query path isn't that difficult. One can indeed mix and match which of the many secondary databases to include within a query. That's the beauty of it. An incoming query could be rewritten such that 95% of the timeline of a given query could be covered by the best secondary database, then maybe another 4% is served by segments coming from a bigger secondary database and most likely there will alsways be some segments that have not been re-indexed to some secondary database yet and which therefore would still come from the master datasource.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part is to keep track on a per segment granularty basis whether a secondary datasource is in syn with the master. Those timeranges that are not in sync are not elligible to querying.\r\n\r\nFor the query path, it would also be great if historical queries could contain segment lists coming from different datasources. A historical receive queries that the broker has already rewritten such that there is a list of segments contained in a historical's query. Looking at this segment list, each segment is referenced by its complete ID with the exception of the datasource that the segment belongs to. If one could improve the historical queries such that a list of segments could be passed where every segment also contains the datasource it belongs to, then historicals could already merge data across datasources. \r\nThis would totally work: if the broker has determined that a secondary datasource B is up-to-date with master datasouce A for a given segment-granularity slot and therefore picks some segments form B while choosing segments from A for some other time-interval, then a historical could execute a query on both kinds of segments because everything is column-oriented.\r\n\r\nSome months back I started implementing this feature but never completed it. \r\n\r\nThere are other OLAP features that one could nicely layer on top of your proposed solution at a later time. For instance \"cell materialization\". I once posted a proposal for a different feature which then turned into a discussion of your feature.

Would such an update be acceptable and take away your concerns?\r\n\r\nAnother change I will make is to improve the write speed for large sequential files, this will use a little bit more memory but will give more consistent write speeds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/371587596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/371643762","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5429#issuecomment-371643762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5429","id":371643762,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTY0Mzc2Mg==","user":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-08T22:17:37Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T22:17:37Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks like it has a problem in integration tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/371643762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/371645284","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/5440#issuecomment-371645284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5440","id":371645284,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTY0NTI4NA==","user":{"login":"njhartwell","id":2574830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzQ4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2574830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell","html_url":"https://github.com/njhartwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njhartwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-08T22:23:36Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T22:23:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"CLA was signed and submitted;

for the feedback @jihoonson. I will address it in my next commit. Can you point me out as to how should I go about writing tests for this feature? I looked at GroupByQueryRunnerTest and I couldn't find an easy way of mocking the push down behavior. I essentially need a way to mimic that the nested query is getting executed on the historical nodes, and then the outer most query is operating on the results obtained after merging the results returned by the historicals. Would it make sense to instead use Druid SQL and write tests in something like CalciteQueryTest?

Maybe Druid will end up using similar rewrite rules.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/372876146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/372883047","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5482#issuecomment-372883047","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5482","id":372883047,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3Mjg4MzA0Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-14T02:22:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T02:22:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Would it make sense for Calcite to have some utility functions or rules that projects like Druid could use to help convert GIS functions into spatial filters?
