This memory area is split into files 0x1 thru 0xFFFF, with each file containing 10000 registers 0 thru 9999.\r\n(In the modbus spec it mentions that while you can go above 10dec files interoperability with older equipment could be compromised, assuming they are talking about the Modicon Modbus protocol in which 984 controllers had file record up to 10.)\r\n\r\nFor a client I see no reason to implement up to 0xFFFF file records as the server should respond with an error code if we go out of bounds. (I can fix this, currently we can only query up to 99999 registers.)\r\n\r\nFor each request you can query multiple non-contiguous areas using sub requests, as long as the total length of the response is < 253 bytes. For our implementation I have only used a second sub request if the user queries registers that span a file record e.g. 609998[10]. This keeps it simpler and in line with the format used by the other register areas.\r\n\r\nThe Modicon Modbus protocol document introduces the terms extended registers and the addressing format using 6x notation. It also references allows the user to reference the data area as contiguous memory 600000 thru 698303.\r\n\r\nWhen I started I thought these were used more than they seem to be. Some old 984 controllers use them but it seems they have been removed from newer Schneider controllers. I've found other references to equipment that use these.\r\n\r\nI'll add some documentation to the user Modbus page.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/665538337/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/665540664","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/174#issuecomment-665540664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/174","id":665540664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTU0MDY2NA==","user":{"login":"chrisdutz","id":651105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdutz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdutz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-29T09:09:17Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T09:09:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the feedback ... and absolutely possible I didn't entirely read an implement all of the parts of the spec ... going through so many specs it's difficult to read and process all of them.

Even if that would be a case there is still a pooling connection which will bring yet another type to the stack.\r\n\r\nI do instantiate fields directly in openhab bindings cause by this way I can assure that it compiles against next PLC4X releases and does not depend on changing field syntax. While PLC4X offers universal APIs the openHAB layer built on top of it provides driver and field specific configuration options. For example here you can find an updated discovery logic for one of canopen devices supported by binding:\r\nhttps://github.com/ConnectorIO/connectorio-addons/commit/29c53778791796c642c9011d9adcac0e36376e39#diff-f498576d3c3ecc8a6206f7b7327ef608c0e05441b5c6ae8afcd274d5e47eebcc\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that passing strings involves regular expressions which proved to cause minor, but still, failures. See PLC4X-56, PLC4X-194. Gluing a string with specific field syntax just to pass it to specific driver is simply redundant and subject of additional friction when migrating to future releases (when field syntax changes it goes under compiler radar).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/745244392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/745250414","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/201#issuecomment-745250414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/201","id":745250414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTI1MDQxNA==","user":{"login":"splatch","id":199488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch","html_url":"https://github.com/splatch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T12:13:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:13:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok, code is rebased to current develop and ready for further review.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/745250414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/comments/745469826","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/211#issuecomment-745469826","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/211","id":745469826,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTQ2OTgyNg==","user":{"login":"splatch","id":199488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch","html_url":"https://github.com/splatch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splatch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T18:12:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T18:12:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've added necessary documentation and links.
