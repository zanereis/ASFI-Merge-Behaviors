Then we won't need UI side changes for separate event handling etc. However, we will still need other UI changes for paragraph state management because the execution workflow is changing. Just to make sure that we are on the same page, let me take a moment to explain why those will be needed:\r\n\r\nUnless we want to change the zeppelin architecture of separate interpreter queues, we need to hold paragraphs to prevent them from being executed. Currently all paragraphs get submitted immediately and their status changes to PENDING. With the above approach, only one paragraph will be in any interpreter's queue at any given point of time; hence the status of _yet-to-be executed_ paragraphs will not get updated and the communication to the user that those paragraphs will run eventually will be lost. This will be a major change in the UX. We need to discuss and think about what should be the best way to handle this but as a preliminary implementation, we need to prevent explicit runs of the paragraphs that are not running yet. This will require maintaining state about whether a _run all_ is in progress and passing this to front-end.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on the above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/336371760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/336372886","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2605#issuecomment-336372886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2605","id":336372886,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjM3Mjg4Ng==","user":{"login":"namanmishra91","id":6438072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzgwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6438072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91","html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T07:26:30Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T07:26:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Agreed that should be the ideal solution but considering how tightly it is integrated with the core execution workflow, this will be a risky change and needs to be done with utmost care to avoid any side-effects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/336372886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/comments/336373758","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2619#issuecomment-336373758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2619","id":336373758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNjM3Mzc1OA==","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T07:30:57Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T07:30:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@namanmishra91 I don't understand why it would invoke frontend.

It's easier at build time as you already have your hadoop version fixed, the hadoop-aws and hadoop-azure poms give you the library versions they need.
