We should align it with the Java PubSub impl\r\n\r\nI would even go a bit further. At this moment the wireprotocol is released as version 1.0. If we do this, we are creating a new version, and IMO should handle it as such. \r\nSince we just released 2.2.1, I do think we should create a new bundle next to the 1.0 version. To be able to use the footer, the protocol service needs to be updated. I propose to add a \"hasFooter() : bool\" to it so that the sender/receiver can use that to determine if a footer needs to be processed.\r\nVersion 1.0 of the wireprotocol can be updated to have this call so that the actual protocol can stay the same.\r\nA new version, 1.1, can be created that has the actual footer.\r\n\r\nPlease note: for our own usage I don't see any big risks in _not_ keeping the 1.0 version around. But since we just did a release AND it currently is compatible with the Java PubSub, we need to be a cautious here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/641057905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/642206358","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/255#issuecomment-642206358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/255","id":642206358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjIwNjM1OA==","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T19:18:34Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T19:20:00Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"# [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#255](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/commit/e288834bfe1a28e71764f540cc12e551c2ef0352&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.02%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&height=150&src=pr&token=JdsiThga8P)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master     #255      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   67.83%   67.85%   +0.02%     \n==========================================\n  Files         127      127              \n  Lines       26375    26375              \n==========================================\n+ Hits        17891    17898       +7     \n+ Misses       8484     8477       -7     \n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage Δ | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [libs/framework/src/framework.c](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGlicy9mcmFtZXdvcmsvc3JjL2ZyYW1ld29yay5j) | `75.44% <0.00%> (+0.14%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [...dmin\\_websocket/src/pubsub\\_websocket\\_topic\\_sender.c](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-YnVuZGxlcy9wdWJzdWIvcHVic3ViX2FkbWluX3dlYnNvY2tldC9zcmMvcHVic3ViX3dlYnNvY2tldF90b3BpY19zZW5kZXIuYw==) | `83.14% <0.00%> (+0.56%)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [libs/utils/src/hash\\_map.c](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-bGlicy91dGlscy9zcmMvaGFzaF9tYXAuYw==) | `94.52% <0.00%> (+1.15%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `Δ = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `ø = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/celix/pull/255?src=pr&el=footer).

compared C and \"new\" C++?\r\n\r\nThe discussions surrounding language X vs language Y are always very difficult, because are you really comparing apples to apples?\r\n\r\nIn terms of C++ vs C performance, there are many huge differences in tiny places, but can be explained easily if you dive into it. Generally speaking, for each run-time metric you think of, what you can achieve in C, you can achieve in C++ and vice-versa. For example, C++'s `std::sort` is faster than C's `qsort`. Not because C++ is faster, but because the underlying algorithms are different. GCC's`std::sort` uses Musser's introsort where `qsort` uses quicksort (though I haven't verified that one for GCC specifically). Hence, C++ seemingly has a speed advantage here, which would disappear if the same algorithms were used.\r\n\r\nBut really, for each engineering problem you solve with the same fundamental concepts in C, you can get an exact assembly output copy with C++. Though that would often mean not using exceptions, which would preclude many usages of the std library. But even for those situations, people have made std-like [libraries](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL) to give many of the same benefits, without using exceptions.\r\n\r\nBenchmarking C vs C++ most certainly has been done. See the [Benchmarking Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/cpp.html), this [C++17 specific paper](https://stellar.cct.lsu.edu/pubs/closing_perf_gap_isc_2016.pdf) or one of the [many](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-need-for-speed-part-2-c-vs-fortran-vs-c/), [many](https://deathbytape.com/articles/2015/01/30/c-vs-c-performance.html) other publicly available resources. In fact, [here](https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0733/) is one comparing rust with C++, which comes to pretty much the same conclusion as I have: the same class of languages perform the same. Rust, C and C++ are all systems-class languages where you manage your own memory, giving very comparable performance results.\r\n\r\nNote that you'll find resources such as [this 2003 paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.12.6227&rep=rep1&type=pdf) on the decrease of performance in C++, but in the 17 years since, C++ and the compilers for C++ have advanced a lot. Take the constexpr feature of C++17 for example, [Jason Turner's CppCon presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJwd4JLYJJY) shows that the compiler can move a lot of computation from run-time to compile-time. I do not know of any C equivalent, other than the pre-processor which is a partial equivalence at best.\r\n\r\nThe questions surrounding run-time performance are therefore (in my not so humble opinion) the least important surrounding the decision to move away from C.\r\n\r\nThe right question should be:\r\nWhich requirements do we have for celix and which language best fulfills those?\r\nOr alternatively, which requirements do we have for celix and does C still fulfill these needs?\r\n\r\nI had already written a large reply on trying to answer that question, but I don't think this is the right place to discuss it. I will say though that it is my strong personal belief that using C for celix has introduced a lot of difficulty in implementing things bug-free and it is noticeable by all the bugs we're continuously creating when adding new

There's a lot of code duplication, so I can imagine that there will be plenty of comments.\r\n> \r\n> The only question I have remaining is the `Promise<void> resolveWith(Promise<T> with);` function. Can someone create a test showing the use of such a function?\r\n\r\n Promise can be used as way to see if something is done (ok or nok (onResolve on onFailure).\r\n\r\nThe use case for resolving a void promise with a typed promise is (IMO) if you are not interested in the result downstream, but use want to use the promise as a sync.\r\n\r\nSo for example you get Promise from some function (maybe 3rd party) where the double is the time it took to process, but in \"our\" API we just want to indicate whether were a done (success or failed). In this case you can create a Promise and resolve it with the Promise (regardless if the Promise is already resolved or not)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/662626819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/667301569","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/273#issuecomment-667301569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/273","id":667301569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NzMwMTU2OQ==","user":{"login":"Oipo","id":212134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo","html_url":"https://github.com/Oipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T18:59:52Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T18:59:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\r\n\r\nI'm

This specific index reflects the point in the etcd state member at which a given key was created. You may notice that in this example the index is 2 even though it is the first request you sent to the server. This is because there are internal commands that also change the state behind the scenes, like adding and syncing servers.\r\n\r\n> node.modifiedIndex: like node.createdIndex, this attribute is also an etcd index. Actions that cause the value to change include set, delete, update, create, compareAndSwap and compareAndDelete. Since the get and watch commands do not change state in the store, they do not change the value of node.modifiedIndex.\r\n\r\nIt's probably best to do an `etcdlib_get()` before an `etcdlib_watch()`.

When I wrote my db interface code, the first thing I did was setup a directory/key structure then set a watch on the etcd directory containing all those keys.  Using the index from the last get always resulted in the watch api being triggered on changes that were made in the past.  There was an ugly work around that by writing a key that was outside that dir structure then reading it again, but that was a hack.\r\n\r\n2. In the link you gave (etcd v2 api), there's a section down further titled \"Watch From Cleared Event Index\".   It describes a case that could happen in my system - the modified index of the key being over 1000 revisions old.  This would break my watch api calls.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to have multiple X-Etcd-Index values among a cluster, but I'm assuming that they try to sycn them up asap.

But the solution isn't clear to me yet. Closing/deleting the archive which has been passed to `fw_installBundle2` sounds like a possible unwanted side-effect.

Say you have a library `foo` and you have two bundles (`A` and `B`) exporting a version of this library (1.8.0 and 2.0.0). You also have two bundles (`C` and `D`) importing these libraries. C wants version [1,2) (so version 1 and up, but not 2 or higher than 2) and D wants version [2,3).\r\nSo \r\n```\r\nBundle A  -- Export --> libfoo.so 1.8.0\r\nBundle B  -- Export --> libfoo.so 2.0.0\r\nBundle C <- Import --- libfoo.so [1,2)\r\nBundle D <- Import --- libfoo.so [2,3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this to really work we need to arrange quite some things. And to keep it simple I just focusing on Linux. \r\n## SONAME\r\nThe SONAME (field of data in a shared object file) for libfoo.so 1.0.0 and libfoo.so 2.0.0 need to be different. Even when using dlopen with RTLD_LOCAL, dlopen will just reuse symbols already loaded if you load an already loaded library with the same SONAME.  \r\nThis can be done by ensuring user will compile a shared library with a good unique (for every version) SONAME or by runtime changing the SONAME in a (not yet loaded) library file. \r\nIMO the first one makes using Celix too complex and the second one is just too much hacking for my taste. \r\n\r\nSo after loading, something like\r\n```\r\nBundle A  -- Export --> libfoo.so 1.0.0 [SONAME=libfoo.so.1.8.0]\r\nBundle B  -- Export --> libfoo.so 2.0.0 [SONAME=libfoo.so.2.0.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## NEEDED \r\nA bundle importing a library make this known by the NEEDED field (again a field of data in a shared object file).\r\nThis fields needs to be updated to the actual library imported. So a NEEDED with value libfoo.so will need to transferred to a library reference with an actual version.\r\n\r\nIn this case this cannot be done during compilation, because the whole point in that you runtime import a library which matches your Import statement. So this must be done by updating the NEEDED just before loading the bundle library. \r\nAnd again IMO this is too complex and too much hacking. \r\n\r\nSo after loading, something like\r\n```\r\nBundle C <- Import --- libfoo.so [1,2)  [NEEDED=libfoo.so.1.8.0]\r\nBundle D <- Import --- libfoo.so [2,3) [NEEDED=libfoo.so.2.0.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# dlmopen to the rescue\r\nA few years ago (I think 3) dlmopen was added to GNU libc (linux!). If I read the documentation correctly this should make it possible to create a load library namespace and load libraries only into that namespace.\r\nTheoretically this should make it possible to create a library namespace for every bundle and then \"just\" load libraries into the namespace and make exporting/importing possible that way. \r\nI did some experiments with this, but at that time dlmopen did not seem stable.\r\n\r\nAlso dlmopen is only available for linux.\r\n\r\n# Is it worth it?\r\nAll that being said. I am not sure if it is worth it. In my \"day job\" we do not use import/export of library. \r\n\r\nWe do use LOCAL loading of private bundle libraries to be able to handle multiple versions of libraries. But even for that use case, I am not sure if dynamic loading of libraries is worth it.\r\nThe reasons is that dynamic loading of libaries (in this case using bundles) make debugging more diffcult. Especially when a) using different version of libraries with the same symbols and b) post mortem analysing using a core dump. In the latter you need to somehow load the bundle libraries again to get correct stacktraces.\r\n\r\nAl this in combination that we are moving to smaller executables running as docker/OCI containers I think the whole module layer of OSGi is not worth it. But that just my opinion. \r\nAnd note that Celix is 'marketed' as a OSGI implementation in C and the module layer (including import/export) is part of the OSGi spec.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Refactoring export/import and wiring\r\nCelix also has some implementation for the OSGi Capability Requirement Model.\r\nThis part of the Celix has been very dormant for the last years and something I am not really familiar with. \r\nThe whole Capability Requirement Model is tightly coupled with export/import support. So if this is touched it would be good to revisit the wiring and resolving code of Celix (at least ensure that the types get a celix_ prefix).  \r\nSee \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/celix/blob/master/libs/framework/include/wire.h\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/celix/blob/master/libs/framework/include/requirement.h\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/celix/blob/master/libs/framework/include/capability.h\r\n\r\nSorry for this dump of information. \r\nBut I think it is smart to have a good discussion about this, before starting to code.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/739509543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/739552577","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/302#issuecomment-739552577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/302","id":739552577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTU1MjU3Nw==","user":{"login":"pnoltes","id":1766397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjYzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes","html_url":"https://github.com/pnoltes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnoltes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-06T19:41:20Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T19:41:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The shared memory remove service admin is not working anymore. \r\n\r\nThe remote service admin was refactoring to use libffi (foreign function interface) instead of requiring the creation of remote endpoint/proxy factories. \r\nThe shared memory version of remote service was not refactored to use libffi and as result it does not work anymore. \r\n\r\nThis will need some significant work to get it up and running again.
