Use thrift executable in third_patry (https://github.com/twitter/heron/tree/master/third_party/thrift) to generate the java source code from thrift files. And those thrift executables are version 0.5.1\n2. Then add thrift-java dependencies (which is changed in this pull request) to compile the scribe-sink.\n\nSo chaning the thrift-java dependencies alone will not solve the problem: you have to align the thrift compiler (generating the java source code) and thrift-java dependencies to the same version. This is traced by issue: #912 . You may re-assign the issue to yourself if you want.\n@kramasamy made this workflow. He may have better ideas on it. BTW, I am not convinced on current solutions having two thrift pre-compiled executables directly since c++ binareis are not portable and the linux one may not be able to run on all linux platform.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/228260651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/228284013","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/986#issuecomment-228284013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/986","id":228284013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODI4NDAxMw==","user":{"login":"caofangkun","id":1931407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzE0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1931407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun","html_url":"https://github.com/caofangkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caofangkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-24T08:11:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T08:11:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi

You're using clang whereas I'm using gcc.  But @kramasamy is using gcc and that did not appear to be a problem for him.  The version numbers for all of my stuff is at least as up to date as yours.  I did find one difference in your build log that's different from mine.  Here's yours\n\n-- @nlu90 ---------------------------------------\nFound GNU Autoconf version 2.69\nFound GNU Automake version 1.14.1\n\nWarning:  libtoolize does not appear to be available.  This means that\nthe automatic build preparation via autoreconf will probably not work.\nPreparing the build by running each step individually, however, should\nwork and will be done automatically for you if autoreconf fails.\n\nFortunately, glibtoolize was found which means that your system may simply\nhave a non-standard or incomplete GNU Autotools install.  If you have\nsufficient system access, it may be possible to quell this warning by\nrunning:\n\n   sudo ln -s /opt/twitter/bin/glibtoolize /opt/twitter/bin/libtoolize\n\nFound GNU Libtool version 2.4.2\n\nWarning: Several files expected of projects that conform to the GNU\ncoding standards were not found.

Warning: autoreconf failed\n\n---\n\nIt could be that my new versions of automake or libtool is breaking things.  I suspect it might be automake.  Brew doesn't seem to allow me to revert to a prev version however.   This should probably be fixed, because if automake versioning is the problem, I probably won't be the only one with this problem.  Will need to investigate further when I get back to the office later this week.\n\nIn the meantime, @kramasamy, would you mind sending me your build log as well, so I can cross reference with @nlu90 and mine?

Now back to Heron without vagrant and docker; quite an adventure!  I do have a small cluster of one master and two slave nodes all running Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nI tried your suggestion moving the setting above from scheduler.yaml to client.yaml and also adjusted to URI to include the scheme `file` such that it now says:\n`heron.package.core.uri:                      \"file:///home/hadoopuser/.heron/dist/heron-core.tar.gz\"`\nHowever, I now do get an error on the slave nodes that they cannot find the file, which is not surprising, as I had not installed Heron on them because I naively assumed that the necessary files would be shared through the Hadoop file system.  \n\nNow my specific question: **How should this be set in a non-vagrant case and what is the minimal installation of Heron on the slaves?**  I am reading the `vagrant/init.sh` file with the argument `slave` and it looks like `build_heron()` only gets executed on the master node, which corroborates my assumption above.  I must admit that I am not very familiar with docker yet, so when I look at `install_docker()` I am just reading that it deals with installing `mesos-slave` and starting the service...  Any thoughts or help?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229702129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229709050","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/1008#issuecomment-229709050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1008","id":229709050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTcwOTA1MA==","user":{"login":"billonahill","id":23758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill","html_url":"https://github.com/billonahill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billonahill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T16:14:52Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T16:14:52Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"üëç \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229709050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229744820","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1011#issuecomment-229744820","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/1011","id":229744820,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTc0NDgyMA==","user":{"login":"kramasamy","id":367684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy","html_url":"https://github.com/kramasamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kramasamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T18:19:41Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T18:19:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@ideal-hp - let me know so we can close the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/comments/229744820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
