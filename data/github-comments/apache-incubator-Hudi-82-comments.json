This can happen due to the following reason : Say your job in writing to the Hudi table every 15 mins and you have chosen to keep only the latest version of the parquet file. Now, your snapshot job runs every 1 hr and takes around 1 hr to finish. What can happen is that the snapshot job ends up reading an older version of the parquet file while the new version is being created by the ingestion job and the cleaner deletes the older version.\r\nSince your job was running for many days, it seems like either a) The frequency of the ingestion job to Hudi or the snapshot job to Hive changed b) The snapshot job runs for longer period of time causing file not found c) It was just working by chance\r\nTo fix this issue, please make sure you keep enough number of file versions so that a long running job (like the snapshot job) can find the file it started to read in the first place. \r\nPlease take a look at your configurations for the cleaner policy and then tune them using this config -> https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations.html#withCleanerPolicy","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/696209149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/696212548","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2095#issuecomment-696212548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2095","id":696212548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjIxMjU0OA==","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T16:03:28Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T16:03:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@vishalpathak1986 Currently, Hudi supports writing inserts in columnar file fomat (parquet) for MOR tables.

Consider the following sequence of events \r\n\r\nt0: writer schedules compaction at time instant `c`\r\nt1: Compactor starts processing `c`'s plan\r\nt2: compaction finishes with `c.commit` published on the data timeline (not yet synced to metadata timeline) \r\nt3: Next round of writing, writer opens metadata table, which adds the base file produced in c.commit to metadata table.\r\n\r\nAny queries running between t2 and t3, cannot rely on metadata since the new base file will not be present in metadata table. The timeline will indicate that the compaction completed, and the latest file slice will be computed  as simply the logs written to the file groups since compaction. This will lead to incorrect results. \r\n\r\nIf we consider just writer alone, we may be okay since we first sync the metadata table before we do anything for the delta commit at t3. But in general for queries, we should advise enabling metadata table based listings only, after all writers/cleaner/compactor have been enabled to use metadata and been successfully using it to publish new/deleted files directly to the metadata table. In short, queries cannot rely on metadata table, with the syncing mechanism as the main thing that keeps data and metadata timelines together. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/696429882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/696430277","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2064#issuecomment-696430277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2064","id":696430277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjQzMDI3Nw==","user":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-21T23:19:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T23:19:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Food for thought: we should also think about how we are going to add new metadata partitions in the background, as writers/cleaner/compactors keep running.

Create a new Hudi MOR table from Spark Datasource API by passing Batch1.json\r\n2. Enabled Hive sync through spark configs ( After this MOR table is created and no problems at all )\r\n3.

Can't we directly use `hudi datasource` or `delta streamer` for testing with following options set to true while writing: `hoodie.metadata.file.listings.enable`, `hoodie.metadata.file.listings.verify` ?\r\n\r\n- Also for testing query performance using `spark datasource`, `spark-sql`, `hive` and `presto` I am assuming it will detect that metadata table is present and automatically use that for getting the list ?\r\n\r\nWill review the PR this week as well to understand the implementation details.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/698068512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/698069429","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1827#issuecomment-698069429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1827","id":698069429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODA2OTQyOQ==","user":{"login":"wangxianghu","id":49835526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM1NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49835526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxianghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-24T02:12:53Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T02:12:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> @wangxianghu on the checkstyle change to bump up the line count to 500, I think we should revert to 200 as it is now.\r\n> I checked out a few of the issues. they can be brought within limit, by folding like below.\r\n> if not, we can turn off checkstyle selectively in that block?\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> public class HoodieSparkMergeHandle<T extends HoodieRecordPayload> extends\r\n>     HoodieWriteHandle<T, JavaRDD<HoodieRecord<T>>, JavaRDD<HoodieKey>, JavaRDD<WriteStatus>, JavaPairRDD<HoodieKey, Option<Pair<String, String>>>> {\r\n> ```\r\n\r\ndone ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/698069429/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/698074779","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2105#issuecomment-698074779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2105","id":698074779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODA3NDc3OQ==","user":{"login":"wangxianghu","id":49835526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODM1NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49835526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxianghu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxianghu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-24T02:32:40Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T02:47:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhasudha This exception occurs because the methods to generate data in `QuickstartUtils` treat `ts` field as `long` type, while the schema provided by `QuickstartUtils` shows `ts` is `double` type.
