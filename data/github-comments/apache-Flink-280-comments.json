@fhueske. Sorry that the description might be a bit imprecise. I updated descriptions in both the PR and the JIRA ticket. You're right, it's not all code, here I'm mainly referring to external catalog related code, and @twalthr and I have discussed it in [FLINK-10689](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10689). Let me explain here:\r\n\r\nBackground is that we have two parallel efforts going on right now - FLINK-10686, driven by Timo, includes moving external catalogs APIs from flink-table to flink-table-common, from Scala to Java; FLINK-10744 I'm working on right now to integrate Flink with Hive and enhance external catalog functionality.\r\n\r\nAs discussed with @twalthr in [FLINK-10689](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10689), we'd better parallelize these efforts while introducing minimal overhead for integrating them later. An agreed way is to writing new code/feature related to external catalogs/hive in Java in flink-table first then move to other module like flink-table-common, this way we can minimize migration efforts. If existing classes are modified for a feature we can start migrating them to Java in a separate commit first and then perform the actual feature changes, and migrated classes can be placed in flink-table/src/main/java until we find a better module structure.\r\n\r\nDoes my explanation here relieve your concerns?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435950340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435998278","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6980#issuecomment-435998278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6980","id":435998278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTk5ODI3OA==","user":{"login":"jgrier","id":787242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzI0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/787242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier","html_url":"https://github.com/jgrier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T19:11:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T19:11:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Looks good @tweise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/435998278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436074270","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/7024#issuecomment-436074270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7024","id":436074270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjA3NDI3MA==","user":{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-05T23:26:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T23:26:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I prefer to use related path for keep path issue isolated among versions.

I quickly went over the changes and have some high-level comments:\r\n\r\n1. It would be better if there is clearer distinction of responsibility for the CatalogManager class. If it manages catalogs and temp tables/functions, then it should just expose those as needed. If we need something extra, then we need some justification.\r\n\r\n2. Since we are encapsulating catalog, Calcite schema, and temp tables/functions in CatalogManager, we should hide them as much as possible. Exposing something like registerExternalCatalog() might trigger some questions.\r\n\r\n3. Intuitively TableEnvironment depends on CatalogManager but not vise versa.

I just wanted to raise awareness that we don't want to implement *all* new (or heavily modified) classes in Java. Some parts of the `flink-table` code base (esp. most of the existing functionality) should remain implemented in Scala for now until we agree on a coordinated effort to move towards Java. For certain parts like the ones in this PR, Java is fine.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436183200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436190068","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6963#issuecomment-436190068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6963","id":436190068,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjE5MDA2OA==","user":{"login":"yanghua","id":2283778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODM3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2283778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua","html_url":"https://github.com/yanghua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanghua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T09:39:15Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T09:39:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@pnowojski OK, Shall I also remove the commit about \"Clearly sleep for a while to wait for the correctness of the elasticsearch statistics.\" and fix it in a sperate PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436190068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436190749","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6927#issuecomment-436190749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6927","id":436190749,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjE5MDc0OQ==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T09:41:25Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T09:41:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yanghua is this PR up to date?

\r\n> Will the influxdb client just throw an exception if the db doesn't exist?\r\n\r\nYes, if the database doesn't exists, the InfluxDB service would return an error response. This would result in an exception during reporting.\r\n\r\n> Does it make sense to consider automatically creating the db if it doesn't exist?\r\n\r\nImo, better **not** to do it in the reporter. This is mainly due to how InfluxDB operates. Metrics in InfluxDB are stored under `<database>.<retention policy>`.\r\nIf the reporter creates just `<database>`, then the InfluxDB (by default) would generate a default `<retention policy>` with  infinite duration. This may be not desired for production use.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the report can create the database. As follow up, it can also be extended to create the retention policy, but this would require much more parameters (name, duration, replication, shard duration). At the end this results in configuration bloat in the reporter and possible wrong configuration in production use.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Maybe, to better reflect that the InfluxDB database should be created separately, make the `db` configuration parameter as required (without default).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436566905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/436568924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6927#issuecomment-436568924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6927","id":436568924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjU2ODkyNA==","user":{"login":"pnowojski","id":8957547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTc1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8957547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski","html_url":"https://github.com/pnowojski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnowojski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-07T09:57:01Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T09:57:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@yanghua please do not trigger rebuild of errors like this:\r\n```\r\nWaiting for Elasticsearch node to work...\r\ncurl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 9200: Connection refused\r\ncurl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 9200: Connection refused\r\n\r\n[FAIL] 'SQL Client end-to-end test' failed after 0 minutes and 29 seconds!
