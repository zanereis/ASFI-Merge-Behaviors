Maybe I didn't describe it very well, so let me try to summarize it differently:</p>\n\n<p>The problem occurs if <tt>kill-existing-workers-with-change-in-components</tt> tries to kill a worker that has been started but has not yet written a single heartbeat, so <tt>read-allocated-workers</tt> returns a state of <tt>:not-started</tt> and also no information about the port this worker is assigned to. Therefore in this line <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L536\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L536</a> the second argument to <tt>shutdown-worker</tt> will be <tt>nil</tt>.<br/>\nThis leads to:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><tt>pids</tt> is empty (<a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L277\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L277</a>), therefore the worker is not killed</li>\n\t<li><tt>try-cleanup-worker</tt> is also called with an <tt>id</tt> of <tt>nil</tt> (<a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L303\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L303</a>)</li>\n\t<li>which will delete the local state files for all workers, since <tt>org.apache.storm.config/worker-root conf nil</tt> returns for example '/var/lib/storm/workers/' and this path is deleted (<a href=\"https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L265\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.0.1/storm-core/src/clj/org/apache/storm/daemon/supervisor.clj#L265</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>The heartbeat files of the workers that are still running will eventually be recreated at the heartbeat, but the PID files are gone for good at that point, so even stopping the topology won't help. Only manually killing the worker processes will solve the problem.</p>\n\n\n<p>P.S: I also attached a workaround patch.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612913429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/227854286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1136#issuecomment-227854286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1136","id":227854286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzg1NDI4Ng==","user":{"login":"dan-blanchard","id":976345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/976345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-blanchard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-blanchard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-22T19:40:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T19:40:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Pystorm seems great, and we lack contributors who care multi-lang implementations as one of major module so I'd still rather rely on stable implementation than build from scratch.

Furthermore, there were a couple of design decisions that would be ideal to do at this point in order to reuse code, and keep it clean and modular. Since it would be too verbose to go over those discussions in here, I just created a pull request with the changes that I believe are adequate to address the wildcard topic pattern requirement. This is the pull request: https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1516\n\nAlthough I had this in my todo list, since you already worked on it, it's totally fine for you to get the credit for it. Hence feel free to assign the JIRA to you, and recommit the PR with your username. Please mention that we worked on this together, and it's all good.

This will immediately block anyone from submitting the topology except storm user.<br/>\n2. configs right now requires username as key: hosts , groups as values. This is not easy to automate via deployment tools. Also every user who wants to submit should be listed in this config (correct me if I am wrong here).<br/>\n3. I understand security should be closed by default . But here in this case we are just blocking everyone to submit a topology or look at topology metrics .</p>\n\n<p>Ideally we should provide wildcard support and make it default or at least have that option to user. <br/>\nWildcard should be that a given user can impersonate user x . So I can just add config like any user can impersonate user x.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I am seeing here in case of Ambari we've a storm view that will send requests through Ambari proxy server. In this case it will send user \"harsha\" is trying to impersonate user \"ambari-server1\" (user x in above example). With current implementation, any user who is trying to access their topology needs to be added to the nimbus.impersonation.acl along with hostname from which they might be querying etc.. in a hosted platform this going to be harder as we keep adding users to the
