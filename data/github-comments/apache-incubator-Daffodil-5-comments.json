Will do. Maybe it's also worth adding a note in the .gitignore file that it should not include OS/IDE related files and to use the other options instead?\r\n\r\nRegarding accidental commits of OS/IDE files, I'd guess that in the majority of cases, if not all, those files won't have an Apache license, which means they will fail the ratCheck. So that should hopefully catch the cases where contributors just do something like ``git add . && git commit``. But still something to be aware of for sure, it's definitely possible for these files to include licenses that rat won't have a problem with. We also need to keep an eye out for .gitignore or ratExcludes changes that include OS/IDE files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/723123861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/723137209","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/452#issuecomment-723137209","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/452","id":723137209,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzEzNzIwOQ==","user":{"login":"jw3","id":1545372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDUzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3","html_url":"https://github.com/jw3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jw3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T15:21:23Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T21:59:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Draft based on #431, will rebase once thats merged.\r\n\r\n### draft todo\r\n- [X] import from [reference impl](https://github.com/ctc-oss/daffodil-schematron-validator)\r\n- [x] rebase after #431\r\n- [x] tests\r\n- [x] todos\r\n- [x] doc\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/723137209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/723194622","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/452#issuecomment-723194622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/452","id":723194622,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzE5NDYyMg==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T17:10:07Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T17:10:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Haven't looked at the code yet, just wanted to first verify new dependencies and make sure their licenses allow them to be used/distributed with Daffodil. The new dependencies, including transitive depenencies, and license appear to be:\r\n\r\n* ``com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:3.0.2 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.helger:ph-collection:9.5.1 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.helger:ph-commons:9.5.1 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.helger:ph-jaxb-pom:1.1.0 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.helger:ph-jaxb:9.5.1 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.helger:ph-schematron:5.6.3 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.helger:ph-xml:9.5.1 (ALv2)``\r\n* ``com.sun.activation:jakarta.activation:1.2.2 (EDL 1.0)``\r\n* ``com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl:2.3.3 (EDL 1.0)``\r\n* ``jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api:2.3.3 (EDL 1.0)``\r\n* ``net.sf.saxon:Saxon-HE:10.2 (MPL 2.0)``\r\n* ``org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.30 (MIT)``\r\n\r\nALv2 is obviously fine to use with Daffodil. EDL and MIT are [category A](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a), so not a problem to include in both source or binary form. Though, as depedencies, we would only distribute them as a binary.\r\n\r\nMPL is [category B](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b), which is allowed to be distributed, but only in binary form, which should be fine since that's how we would distribute it. Though there are caveats that we include a prominent notice in a README or something.\r\n\r\nSo from a purely licesning point of view, I think this should all be fine. We will need to inspect all these dependencies to see if they have NOTICE files, and include them in our daffodil-cli/bin.NOTICE. We also need to update the daffodil-cli/bin.LICENSE file with the files that are not Apache license. So there's a decent amount of work to ensure the licensing meetgs Apache standards.\r\n\r\nAlso, it kindof feels like a lot of extra dependencies that we might not necessarily use, for example slf4j seems maybe unnecessary. It about doubles the size of our dependencies. Daffodil jars are about 24MB, existing deps ware 8.9MB, new deps are 9.1MB (half of that is Saxon-HE). It sort of feels unfortunate to double the size of deps just for schematron. Not sure that's a blocker, but maybe some of these dependencies aren't needed and can be excluded?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps there are alternativ implementations that provide the functionality/performance we need? Also, I believe schematron is usually just implemented via XSLT, so could perhaps just be implemented via an XSLT library?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/723194622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/723238384","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/451#issuecomment-723238384","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/451","id":723238384,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzIzODM4NA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T18:41:29Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T18:41:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Pushed two changes, one that adds a note to .gitignore to prevent OS/IDE changes, and another so that plugins.sbt is not ignored by the *.sbt ignore.

The way the postifx suspension stuff works is it depends on some previous DOSs and cannot resolve until their ``zeroLengthStatus`` is determined. Let's assume our postfix suspension only cares about the zeroLengthStatus of the buffered DOS A.\r\n\r\nNow let's assume DOS B is finished via a call to ``setFinished``. Because DOS B is not direct, nothing happens except setting its state to Finished.\r\n\r\nNow let's assume DOS A is finished via a call to ``setFinished``. Because DOS A is not direct, nothing happens except setting its state to Finished.\r\n\r\nLet's also assume at this point nothing asks for the zeroLengthStatus of DOS A. So if nothing wrote to DOS A at this point, we can assume DOS A is a ``Zero`` zeroLengthStatus. But that isn't set yet.\r\n\r\nNow let's assume the Direct DOS is finished via a call to ``setFinished``. Because it is direct and it's finished, we then deliver the content of A to the OutputStream in our DirectDOS, and the A DOS becomes the new direct DOS. The state of the old direct DOS is set to \"Uninitialized\", i.e. ``isDead == true``. Because DOS B is also finished, we can deliver the contents of B to the new direct DOS (which is DOS A). Now DOS A is marked as uninitialized, ``isDead == true``, and B becomes the new direct DOS.\r\n\r\nSo at this point we have two \"dead\" DOS's (the original direct DOS and DOS A) and DOS B is now the direct DOS.\r\n\r\nBut there is still a suspension that needs to know the zeroLengthStatus of this dead DOS A so that it can determine if the postfix separator should be unparsed. When the suspension unsuspends (whenever that may be), it will ask for the zeroLengthStatus of this dead DOS and we must give it an answer. Even though this DOS is dead, it still is needed to provide zero length information.\r\n\r\nSo the crux of the issue is that a DOS that a suspension depends on could be finished, made direct, and then made dead, all before the suspension that needs information about that DOS unsuspends and asks for the zeroLengthStatus.

E.g., suppose we wanted to pool these DOS objects for reuse. The state we call \"dead\" for them is not equivalent to \"reusable\" so should be put back into the pool. This suggests the state dead and method isDead should be renamed to outputComplete or some other name that suggests notDeadYet, but that one aspect of usage is over with, but there can still be suspensions. I think the suspension has to be attached to the DOS while it is live. Hence, we could add a hasAssociatedSuspension bit to the DOS object. Then things that are outputComplete but not hasAssociatedSuspension are truly \"dead\" and could be recycled. Otherwise they would be in state hasAssociatedSuspension until that suspension is resolved. It probably isn't worth it to do all this. I'd just like to somehow capture this very subtle invariant that dead doesn't mean fully-dead.

I think merge commits created by merging master into this branch could make that process more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe downside as mentioned, is that it can cause some headaches if multiple people are working on this dev branch and it's constantly being rebased. I would suggest the solution here is to only rebase periodicaly (e.g once every month or two) and ensure there is good public communication when a rebase is needed/planned. If it needs to be rebased due to some new feature in master for example, send out an email to dev@ and give the usual 72 hours to make sure there are no outstanding commits for this dev branch. At that point, perform the rebase and send out an email saying it's been rebased and for people to update their branch.\r\n\r\nNote that we don't need a new PR for this dev branch rebase, we just trust that whoever does the rebase verified there were no issues before doing the force push. Also, any open PRs for this branch should still remain open and github should do the right thing.

That's could probably be useful, but it's maybe a bit of an effort--so maybe it makes sense to be part of a separate PR?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/759555230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/759555484","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/470#issuecomment-759555484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/470","id":759555484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTU1NTQ4NA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-13T16:14:04Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T16:14:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Coverage report looks good, although a CLI \"info data text/binary\" test would make almost all of the newly added code covered by tests.\r\n\r\nAgreed, will add.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/759555484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/759643550","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/470#issuecomment-759643550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/470","id":759643550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1OTY0MzU1MA==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-13T18:43:27Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T18:43:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The diff approach was actually not as complicated as I thought it might be.

But without the new streaming capabilities introduced in 3.0.0, I'm not sure how likely it is to actually hit this issue. I suspect of the time you'll just run out of memory before hit this bug. I just now tested this same schema + data with 2.7.0 and if looks like it's just stuck in the garbage collector trying to find memory to free. I suspect if I let it run long enough I'd get an OutOfMemoryException.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth considering a 3.0.1 patch release for this issue, since there isn't really a good workaround. The only workaround when dealing with files larger than 256MB I can think of is to avoid the InputStream constructor when creating an InputSourceDataInputStream so it just doesn't use the bucketing stuff at all. Instead a user can use the ByteBuffer or Array[Byte] cosntructors, but that means that all the data must be read into memory, and there's a 2GB limit, so it's not that great of a workaround. And that only works for people using the API. There's no workaround for people using the CLI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/760313432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/comments/760316642","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/daffodil/pull/472#issuecomment-760316642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/472","id":760316642,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDMxNjY0Mg==","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-14T16:42:44Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T16:42:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI, the user than ran into this issues says that they are able to split files so they are less than 256GB, which should workaround this issue.
