Is an unpublished dashboard NOT viewable, or is it viewable but less discoverable? The original comment by @Tresdon explicitly says that it IS viewable though less discoverable (\"The idea here was that no dashboard is strictly “private” in that it cannot be viewed if it is not published.\"), but @mistercrunch 's comment about migration and @Tresdon's reply about it seems to imply that unpublished dashboards are NOT viewable. I could see this being a successful feature in either of these cases, but I think we should be super clear about which one it is and make sure the product experience matches up with these expectations. I also think it's worth considering whether the intention is to have this status mean public vs private; or prod vs in-progress?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that unpublished dashboards are viewable, but less discoverable. Specifically, the only differences between published vs unpublished dashboard are (a) When viewing the dashboard, the eye icon has a strikethrough or not and (b) whether it shows up in the list of dashboards (on the /welcome page, not the [crud UI](https://superset.d.musta.ch/dashboardmodelview/list/)). My feedback is based on this understanding.\r\n- We may want to consider a more visible/text-based design for publish vs unpublished in the context of viewing a dashboard. For one, it seems potentially misleading to have an eye icon that's crossed out if that dashboard isn't actually hidden (since it's viewable, even if it's unpublished, and a crossed-out eye seems to imply you can't see it). Second, if we are going to make the dashboard viewable even when it's unpublished, then I think a lot of the value of a \"published\" status is in communicating the intent of the dashboard creator -- whether it's ready for general consumption or it's a work-in-progress/private audience. I think the icon is a little too subtle right now for communicating this important piece of information.\r\n- The interaction for making a dashboard \"published\" might belong better in the action menu for dashboards, since a natural workflow might be create->edit->publish dashboards. It's also an action that only the dashboard owner can take, so naturally it fits better with the other dashboard owner actions, vs the favoriting action which is an action that anyone can take across any dashboard. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38537226/43799901-9eeb1188-9a43-11e8-9635-89214b162567.png)\r\n- I'm not sure how much the /welcome page is used for people to discover dashboards, and therefore I'm not sure how much of an impact there will be from hiding unpublished dashboards from that page. \r\n- It might be helpful for the [CRUD view](https://superset.d.musta.ch/dashboardmodelview/list/) to show whether a dashboard is published or not, and to be able to filter on status (not sure if this is already the plan).

We are looking for feedback and approval before implementing.\r\n\r\n### Dashboard changes\r\n* Global filters will be the focus of the MVP\r\n    * Tab and section filters would work similarly but will not be included in the initial implementation. The initial focus will be to replace the existing Filter Box chart with a native, global dashboard filter\r\n* The filter component is drag & drop from the insert panel, similar to tabs\r\n    * Global filters go above dashboard-level tabs and below the dashboard title (see images below for an example)\r\n    * Tab filters go below tabs\r\n    * Section filters go at the top of the section\r\n* New filters can be added when the dashboard is in \"Edit Mode\" via a button that appears after the list of filters\r\n    * Individual filters are added based on datasource / column name\r\n    * Clicking the New Filter button will open a modal with \"Data Source\" and \"Column\" options to select the filter column\r\n    * If the column selected is a time column, the 'Since' / 'Until' filters will be added\r\n* Filter controls for the dashboard are initially collapsed and can be expanded / collapsed as needed (see images below for an example)\r\n* Additional options such as timegrain and instant filtering are added via the configuration cog\r\n\r\n### Chart changes\r\n* Filter box will be removed as a chart type\r\n* Filter boxes that are currently included in dashboards will need to be removed from the dashboard and options will be added as global filter options\r\n* All existing filter box charts are deleted (not sure what else can be done with them since they can't be added to dashboards anymore)\r\n\r\n### URL changes\r\n* The `preselect_filters` query parameter can still be used to fill in filters via a link. It is currently a map which includes the Filter Box ID. The format will need to change into a map of column name to arrays instead\r\n    * Old format\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"414\": {\r\n            \"column1\": [\r\n                \"value1\",\r\n                \"value2\"\r\n            ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"12\": {\r\n            \"column2\": [\r\n                \"value3\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    * New format\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"column1\": [\r\n          \"value1\",\r\n           \"value2\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"column2\": [\r\n          \"value3\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    * This change can be made backwards compatible by collecting the filters in the old format, ignoring the ID, and applying the filter values based on the column name \r\n\r\n### Dashboard mockups\r\n\r\n*Collapsed filters*\r\n\r\n![global filter closed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/222699/43837185-59133bc8-9add-11e8-895e-02c66898796a.png)\r\n\r\n*Opened filters*\r\n\r\n![global filter open](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/222699/43837195-60e4c4fc-9add-11e8-9f8d-6d2f6c914470.png)\r\n\r\n*New filter dialog*\r\n\r\n![filters opened edit edit filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/222699/43837207-66c6d61c-9add-11e8-8b9d-8df0ee8b40a9.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/411389249/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/411407496","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/660#issuecomment-411407496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/660","id":411407496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTQwNzQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"jeffrey-d-lipkowitz","id":9707566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDc1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9707566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffrey-d-lipkowitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T13:35:49Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T13:35:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I was wondering if any features have changed to allow true row level security.

thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\n> I can’t tell based on the .gif what visual affordances in the UI tell the dashboard owner this is where they add a tag.\r\n> Dashboards can have really long names. The example currently shown is with a best case dashboard name and not faced with the space issue.\r\n\r\nGood point, right now this is far from optimal:\r\n\r\n![width](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/43864722-5600508c-9b15-11e8-966c-91a024ea2215.gif)\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can make the component have a fix width and have the tags wrap. Thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n> The tag visuals clash with the visuals for altered. Side note the white text on yellow tags isn't accessible. The blue isn't either.\r\n\r\nThe colors come from the Bootstrap theme. I created https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/5590 to address the problem separately.\r\n\r\n> You could place the tags in the dropdown menu as well.

I'm guesing the connection string should be something along the lines of `influxdb://user:password@hostname`. After that go to SQL Lab and try to fire a `select * from table` to see if you can get some data. If all is well you can proceed by implementing a dedicated InfluxDB specific engine specification under `superset/db_engine_spec.py`, where you can mostly copy logic from other engine implementations. Start out by implementing some time grains, and if there are any other quirks, those should be straight forward to add later, e.g. schema settings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/411641768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/411663732","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4666#issuecomment-411663732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/4666","id":411663732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTY2MzczMg==","user":{"login":"yyhpys","id":1300353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDAzNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1300353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys","html_url":"https://github.com/yyhpys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyhpys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-09T07:26:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T07:31:28Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi.

Crontab '*/1 * * * *' and also tried every 2 and 5 mins.

I reviewed your changes and it seems to be the default behavior is hourly.  I don't really understand EMAIL_REPORTS_CRON_RESOLUTION config parameter.  It needs more info. \r\n\r\nWe should add a configuration variable for storage location for celerybeat-schedule.db. It should support both local or remote (S3). \r\n\r\n5. It would be nice if you could you add superset command line option to start celery beat? \r\n\r\n6. In email UI, we should add subject input.
