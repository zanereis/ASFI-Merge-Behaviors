This is indeed a problem.\r\nBut there some thing that you need to know:\r\n\r\n1. The `labelCleaner` thread is running on all FEs, each FE will clean its own `deleteInfos`. So don't need to write a edit log `OP_REMOVE_OLD_DELETE_INFO` to \"tell\" other FE to clean the delete infos.\r\n\r\n2. Once the `labelCleaner` thread cleans the delete infos on each FE. What we need to take care is to clean the delete infos in meta replay logic. Eg, after calling `DeleteHandler.read()` method, we should clean the delete info actively, so that the meta image won't contains expired delete infos.\r\n\r\nThis logic is a bit convoluted. If you don't understand something, welcome to communicate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/900447517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/900722415","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/6464#issuecomment-900722415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/6464","id":900722415,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs41r-7v","user":{"login":"stalary","id":24592373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTkyMzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24592373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary","html_url":"https://github.com/stalary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stalary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-18T00:32:07Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T00:32:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"assign

Hi @zenoyang thanks for your PR. This is indeed a problem.\r\n> But there some thing that you need to know:\r\n> \r\n> 1. The `labelCleaner` thread is running on all FEs, each FE will clean its own `deleteInfos`. So don't need to write a edit log `OP_REMOVE_OLD_DELETE_INFO` to \"tell\" other FE to clean the delete infos.\r\n> 2. Once the `labelCleaner` thread cleans the delete infos on each FE. What we need to take care is to clean the delete infos in meta replay logic. Eg, after calling `DeleteHandler.read()` method, we should clean the delete info actively, so that the meta image won't contains expired delete infos.\r\n> \r\n> This logic is a bit convoluted. If you don't understand something, welcome to communicate.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for @morningman 's review, I really didn't consider it thoroughly before. Now I have sorted out the new plan.\r\n\r\nIf the EditLog synchronization logic is canceled, each FE regularly cleans up DeleteInfo, which is relatively simple to implement, but the currentTimeMs of each FE is different when cleaning, so there will be inconsistencies in DeleteInfo in each FE, although the inconsistency seems to have little effect.\r\n\r\nSo my plan is:\r\n- Execute regularly on the Master FE, and notify other FEs to execute through EditLog, all FEs sharing the same timestamp will not cause inconsistencies.\r\n- When an FE plays back metadata, after the deleteHandler is initialized, the DeleteInfo cleanup logic is triggered, and other FEs are notified to clean up through EditLog to ensure consistency.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help to see if there are any problems with this, thank you very much","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/900910166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/901029039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/6453#issuecomment-901029039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/6453","id":901029039,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBfSlxs41tJyv","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-18T11:15:24Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T11:15:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"PR

背景\r\n当前优化器存在的一些问题：\r\n    1. 内聚程度不够高，可拓展性存在一定限制。\r\n    2. 自低向上一次成型，不是动态规划，缺乏多个 plan 的预估选取。\r\n    3. 优化策略以启发式为主，对于数据依赖相关的优化策略处理不好。\r\n\r\n# New Optimizer\r\n1. 基于 Cascades 理论搭建 New Optimizer 架构，分层明确，支持动态规划，精准定位 best plan。\r\n2. CBO，基于 cost 的优化器，可通过统计信息辅助筛选出 best plan。\r\n\r\n# 参与方式\r\n1. 给 New Optimizer 征集一个名字\r\n要求：一个单词，或词即可。名称尽量简单，易于传播，能凸现 New Optimizer 的某种特质，比如最快，最精确。\r\n\r\n2. 诚招对 New Optimizer 有想法的热血青年，一起合作。\r\n要求： 对 Optimizer 技术有强烈热情，如果理解 Cascades 理论，或者有其他开源产品优化器开发经验更好。\r\n\r\n新手任务：随便找一个算子，比如 agg node，确定在执行这个算子时，主要数据量和开销（memory等），进一步对比其他 gp， postgres 算子开销 cost model。\r\n\r\n# 联系我\r\n1. 在 ISSUE 下留下你的想法\r\n2. 订阅并给

联系:Apache很多组件都是动物名。\r\n2. 名词:指黑曼巴蛇，是世界上速度最快及攻击性最强的蛇类(没有之一)。其短距离的移动时速可达16- 20公里，拥有惊人的闪电般的速度。\r\n3. 情怀:伟大的前美国职业男子篮球联赛(NBA)洛杉矶湖人队的球星科比·布莱恩特有个绰号叫“黑曼 巴”，那是非洲草原上毒性最烈的一种蛇，而科比的精神，也被称为“曼巴精神”，“永不言弃”是科比自己 给予这种精神的定义。总的来说，曼巴精神，就是从不退却，从不放弃，从不逃遁，忍辱负重，在困难 中创造奇迹。\r\nDoris Optimizer功能类比:面对成千上亿的复杂数据查询等DML操作，优化器总是迎难而上，从不放 弃，在努力探索着最优查询路径，经过层层复杂的优化探索，最终决策出最优的执行方案。另一方面也 是代表我们的开发工程师经历了重重困难，最后创造出了doris这款优秀的产品。\r\n4. 精髓:“科比认为黑曼巴是地球上最致命的掠食者之一，”Avar说道:“这也是他在每场球赛中的取胜之 道——精准且快速。” 找一种动物来比喻科比，会选择什么?科比本人毫不犹豫地答道:“Black Mamba!(黑曼巴)”黑曼巴蛇是非洲毒蛇中体形最长、速度最快、攻击性最强的，它的杀手天性，勇 猛好斗，以及猎食技术高超，这一切都与在篮球场上的科比惊人地相似。\r\n科比经常在比赛中上演绝杀的好戏，那些精彩的表现就像是猎杀猎物时候的黑曼巴蛇一样，冷酷无情， 一击致命。\r\n5. 历史:在古埃及，猎鹰和眼镜蛇是法老的两大守护神，这里指Doris的守护神。\r\n6. 传奇文化:黑曼巴蛇之所以能有很大的名气，其中一个原因是它含了很大的传奇色彩。在非洲，很多 人们都有听过黑曼巴蛇的传奇故事:有人说黑曼巴蛇能追上一匹正在奔跑的马;也有人说，一条黑曼巴
