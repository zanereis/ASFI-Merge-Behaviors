@xicm we have to shade the HBase classes to be compatible with Hive query engine which introduces HBase classes as well. Does changing all relevant class names with shading pattern in `hudi-common/src/main/resources/hbase-site.xml` work for you?\r\n\r\nThanks @yihua, I rename the relevant class names with shaded name in hbase-site.xml, and get the same exception.
