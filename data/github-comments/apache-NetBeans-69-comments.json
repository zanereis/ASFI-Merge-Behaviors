I said that I won't Veto this. And I stand by these words. That does not mean, that I agree with merging this. I think it is an error, but I won't stand in the way.\r\n\r\nWhat concerns me is, that NetBeans _again_ becomes a experiment field and that that will affect the whole code base. Once this is merged and used, our way back is cut or at least removing it will be so painful, that is equivalent to a lock-in. So it comes down how much we trust the entity behind frgaal.\r\n\r\nAt this point I have no reason to trust into it. I'm not aware of any track record of the authors in the javac compiler area, my concerns were not addressed and I did not find any discussion about it in the OpenJDK mailinglists. I see a single vendor, which is in stark contrast to the OpenJDK javac, which is backed by multiple entities.

compilers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/692124437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/692135616","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2358#issuecomment-692135616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2358","id":692135616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjEzNTYxNg==","user":{"login":"entlicher","id":5479271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzkyNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5479271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher","html_url":"https://github.com/entlicher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entlicher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-14T15:31:04Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T15:31:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

Here is a demo: Start by creating a [new module](https://github.com/dukescript/netbeans/commit/d439aee5d5992fd8e6b35bfc57bcc8c013fd6a50) which is using the JDK11 specific [HttpClient](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html) API:\r\n```java\r\n    public void demo() throws Exception {\r\n        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder()\r\n             .version(Version.HTTP_1_1)\r\n             .followRedirects(Redirect.NORMAL)\r\n             .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))\r\n             .proxy(ProxySelector.of(new InetSocketAddress(\"proxy.example.com\", 80)))\r\n             .authenticator(Authenticator.getDefault())\r\n             .build();\r\n        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()\r\n            .uri(URI.create(\"https://foo.com/\"))\r\n            .timeout(Duration.ofMinutes(2))\r\n            .header(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\r\n            .build();\r\n        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());\r\n        System.out.println(response.statusCode());\r\n        System.out.println(response.body());  \r\n    }\r\n```\r\nObviously you can't compile this on JDK8. What do you do? You enable the [future API aware compiler](https://github.com/dukescript/netbeans/commit/72e067467dac6f4f651a048a5cc31ba237d37875) and tell it to use JDK11's API (by setting `javac.target=11`). Then everything compiles even on JDK8. The last step is to [use the module](https://github.com/dukescript/netbeans/commit/b325d3c0297def205c23c781a510f848c4dff1ef) when available:\r\n```java\r\n  UseHttpSpi service = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(UseHttpSpi.class);\r\n  if (service != null) {\r\n      service.demo();\r\n  } else {\r\n      throw new IllegalStateException(\"HttpClient not available on \" + System.getProperty(\"java.version\"));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe module with `javac.target=11`is only enabled when running on JDK11+, otherwise it is disabled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/692671641/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/692675201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2370#issuecomment-692675201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2370","id":692675201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjY3NTIwMQ==","user":{"login":"ebarboni","id":6940099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDAwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6940099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni","html_url":"https://github.com/ebarboni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebarboni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T12:13:58Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T12:13:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sdedic you do lots of commit-validation, can it be usefull to have ant commit-validation on jenkins for master branch ? \r\nI was thinking adding ant index-layer-paths  (list of all the registred elements Actions , Editors).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/692675201/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/692680389","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2370#issuecomment-692680389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2370","id":692680389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjY4MDM4OQ==","user":{"login":"sdedic","id":26788611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26788611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic","html_url":"https://github.com/sdedic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdedic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-15T12:25:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T12:25:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> @sdedic you do lots of commit-validation, can it be usefull to have ant commit-validation on jenkins for master branch ?\r\n> I was thinking adding ant index-layer-paths (list of all the registred elements Actions , Editors).\r\n\r\nI am not there yet, but close.

When it comes to icons, having a consistent scheme is an essential part of \"looking good\". So adding one or two icons only, which will now look different next to the existing ones in the toolbar, actually makes NetBeans look worse. Thus the -1.\r\n\r\nTo review, we also need to see screenshots before and after, at 100% and 200% DPI scaling. Often you'll see issues at this point, that were not evident when you were just looking at the icons in the drawing software. This means recompiling, which takes a while... longer than the time it took to draw two icons.\r\n\r\nUnrelated: I also recommend keeping the icons in a single file in the drawing software (in different \"artboards\" or whatever is the equivalent in Inkscape), so they can be viewed side-by-side while designing them.

I think even NetBeans 8.5 is perfectly fine for that task. We are less sure about 12.0, hence I'd doubt anyone have tried that, but theoretically possible. One of the gray areas we have is the profiler support. The build does not really rebuild the source code with each release, just downloads some dusty zips and populate it's content. If we would like to move forward from this state, I think it's not bad to leave the rusty parts behind.\r\nAlso the state of the profiler worries me a little. Right now a modern JVM often crashes in a few seconds when attaching the profiler (at least on Ubuntu). It might be just some minor binary incompatibility or something else. So it would be at least good to have the profiler binaries rebuilt with each release.\r\nThough I'm going to open a discussion on that on the dev mailing list.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/694856678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/694882793","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2318#issuecomment-694882793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/2318","id":694882793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NDg4Mjc5Mw==","user":{"login":"lkishalmi","id":1381701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi","html_url":"https://github.com/lkishalmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkishalmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-18T13:55:24Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T13:55:24Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jherkel
