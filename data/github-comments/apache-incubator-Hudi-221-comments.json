Thanks for looking into this. \r\n\r\nYes. I am looking for partial update feature wherein the upserts will have only a subset of columns from the target. And the expectation is to update only the subset of columns and take the rest other values from target.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the target table has 5 columns.\r\nA11, A21, A31, A41, A51\r\nThe update that I am trying to ingest has only two columns.\r\nA12,A42\r\nAfter upsert, target should look like this.\r\nA12,A21,A31,A42,A51 \r\n\r\nFilling default values for missing columns will convert the target to a state that violates our use case.
