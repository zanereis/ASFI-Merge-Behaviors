I see that you removed most but not all of the conditionals that suppressed UpdatePassingRef from appearing in release pipelines. In hindsight I think it was a mistake to have conditionalized that at all, and I am glad to see the simplifications! Can you comment whether you tested these changes in a release-branch context or only in a develop context?\r\n\r\nI tested these changes against my personal pipeline, available [here](https://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/rhoughton-pivot-develop-main/jobs/UpdatePassingTokens/builds/27) at least until this PR gets merged. \r\n\r\nThe individual files will still exist (for now) at their same bucket location, but the conditional logic for creating them is encapsulated within the job. In either case, the combined JSON has the value of both, so we'll move to that as a value-add later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/501390899/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/501391937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3705#issuecomment-501391937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3705","id":501391937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTM5MTkzNw==","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-12T18:10:09Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T18:10:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cool, let's do it.

As an example, after the user has finished populating a **huge amount** of data into the cluster, how long should they wait to execute the command?, how many times should they execute the command until they're strongly convinced the index maintenance is over?.

In summary we seem to have largely found consensus on:\r\n* What to cover in an RFC?\r\n* When to write and RFC?\r\n* How to write an RFC?\r\n* Associating a date with an RFC?\r\n* When to write and RFC?\r\n\r\nWe do not have consensus on:\r\n1. Should proposals live in the wiki or the code base?\r\n2. Should discussion of a proposal happen\r\n    1. In a PR\r\n    2. In a [discuss] thread referencing a proposal in the wiki\r\n    3. In the wiki itself\r\n\r\nGiven how many people actively work on this project I’d love to see a little wider participation on the location question we disagree on. \r\n\r\n ## Summary of Location discussion\r\nIt seems that in the discussion so far we have been conflating where the discussion happens and where the proposals go afterwards. Jake, Dan and others have done a great job at listing lots of pros and cons of wiki vs. PR, let me try to split the arguments for the two different decisions we need to make:\r\n\r\n## Where do we keep proposals?\r\n### Proposals live in the wiki\r\n1. All of our existing proposals and technical documentation is already there. Someone searching for information only has to search one place.\r\n2. It easily supports embedding diagrams and other pictures into the proposal, which is important for complicated concepts.\r\n3. Finished RFCs are more easily discoverable - the wiki is indexed on google, and the geode space is searchable on the wiki without finding code as well.\r\n4. Content from RFCs can be easily linked to or incorporated into our Architectural overview\r\n5. Proposals that span multiple geode repositories have a reasonable place to stay.\r\n6. The wiki is purpose built for technical documentation. github is designed for storing code. Lots of little things (like how search results show up, how you add images to docs, how you link docs) work better on the wiki because that's what it is designed for.\r\n\r\n### Proposals live in the code base\r\n1. Keeps RFC and errata changes documented with code changes in time\r\n2. Keeps RFC with sources it effects\r\n3. With PRs, changes can only be accepted by Geode committers by merging the PR.\r\n\r\n## Where do we discuss proposals?\r\n### Discussion happens in the wiki\r\n1. You get to to review and comment inline the formatted text, not the plain text version\r\n2. Proposals that span multiple geode repositories have a reasonable place to stay.\r\n3. Has threading of comments\r\n\r\n### Discussion happens in a PR\r\n1. Has bidirectional email integration\r\n2. Has single place to have discussion\r\nDiscussion happens in the dev list (assuming doc lives in the wiki):\r\n3. Has inline comments\r\n4. It's easy to see the voting status in the \"Reviewers\" side pane, as well as a voting summary at the bottom of the PR.\r\n5. It's easy to see when the RFC is still in the \"voting\" state by whether or not it is open/merged/closed\r\n\r\n### Discussion happens only on the dev list\r\n 1. Highly visible to all contributors.\r\n 2. Very low barrier of entry.\r\n\r\n(I left Discussion on dev list + gets submitted via PR out, since that combination makes no sense to me)\r\n\r\nLet’s give this discussion a little bit more time till EoD Monday 6/24 and then wrap this up. If we cannot get a clear majority, I propose that we keep proposals in the wiki, since that’s the smallest change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/504267094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/comments/504267333","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/3706#issuecomment-504267333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3706","id":504267333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDI2NzMzMw==","user":{"login":"pivotal-amurmann","id":19393329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkzMzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19393329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann","html_url":"https://github.com/pivotal-amurmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-amurmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T02:40:08Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T02:40:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Given the discussion so far, my own vote is\r\n1.

This was so long that it gave the appearance of a hang. I think it ends up waiting for 120 seconds because one of the recovery delay task is probably still sleeping waiting for its time to expire.\r\nI think we want to find a way to cancel this particular task without forcing all other tasks in this executor to be immediately terminated. One possible solution is for the recovery delay task to be scheduled to run after the recovery delay. I don't think executors wait for jobs that are scheduled to run in the future when it is shutdown.

Don't wait to shutdown the executor. Just shut it down immediately. I'm not sure the consequences of this. In the above case, I'm not sure there are any, but there are other cases.\r\n2. Don't schedule the redundancy recovery task for sometime in the future. Wait for the future to arrive and then schedule it.
