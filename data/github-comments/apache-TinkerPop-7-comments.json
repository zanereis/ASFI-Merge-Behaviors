A few things:\n1. Travis is failing, but i dont think that's your fault - from the looks of the output it seems that Travis just died mid build somehow. I can test the build of your PR manually when the time comes.\n2. could you quickly edit the name of your PR to be prefixed with the JIRA issue? That will allow our comments to hook into JIRA nicely for all comments on this ticket. In other words, just change the title to \"TINKERPOP-1125 Use the existing Host iterator\"\n3. Did you run the Gremlin Server integration tests?  Basically, after `mvn clean install` you can just do: `mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false -pl gremlin-server`. Those don't get executed by Travis. \n\nSorry for the extra \"administrative\" work and I can't imagine you've broken anything with this change, but I just would like you to know what our pull request procedure looks like.  You can read more about such things here in the contributor docs:\n\nhttp://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.1.0-incubating/developer.html#_pull_request_format\n\nLast but not least, the tp31 branch is currently frozen for release of 3.1.1-incubating which will go up for vote on Monday, so we probably won't look to merge this in until that is all settled.  Thanks again - please keep the PRs coming. :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/180402242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/180407074","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/211#issuecomment-180407074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/211","id":180407074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDQwNzA3NA==","user":{"login":"kieransherlock","id":2079812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzk4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2079812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock","html_url":"https://github.com/kieransherlock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kieransherlock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T15:41:12Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T15:41:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"1) I hope not!\n2) Done.\n3) No I didn't run these.

The original ticket was about getting the `StructureStandardTestSuite` working on windows (which can be a blocker for graph providers doing dev on windows).  As far as i can gather, that much is fixed.  As a bonus, @velo got us a build on windows through appveyor and even got apache infra to enable it for us.\n\nThere are some good fixes in this PR as-is and it would be nice to see appveyors yaml in the main dev branches.  Since the original issue is resolved, let's get this PR up for VOTE.  To do that, we need appveyor yaml to change slightly so that it doesn't fail the build.  Since the tests don't all pass, @velo can you please change the build to `-Dspark-gremlin.skip.tests=true` or maybe even skip just the failing tests `-Dspark-gremlin.test.excludes=\"**/*ExcludeTest.java` - we do that temporarily until a separate pull request can address those failures (we'll need a new ticket obviously).\n\nDoes that sound reasonable?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/183328060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/183353203","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/225#issuecomment-183353203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/225","id":183353203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MzM1MzIwMw==","user":{"login":"okram","id":148925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODkyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram","html_url":"https://github.com/okram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-12T14:32:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-12T14:32:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Reviewed code.

I assume that since we still don't have a complete build for windows with `mvn clean install` there would be problems with integration tests in that environment.  If the tests all pass on my end I think this should be good to go. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/185895739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/185905949","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/231#issuecomment-185905949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/231","id":185905949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTkwNTk0OQ==","user":{"login":"zackurey","id":1062956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1062956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey","html_url":"https://github.com/zackurey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zackurey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T20:36:37Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T20:43:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@spmallette Off the top of my head:\n1.  Maybe security through obfuscation?  But this is a open source library and one can easily know which method does what based on matching the version of the library with the type signatures\n2.  This will make class files a little larger since before Java8 only the method signature was stored.  Also this does appear to only be supported by Java8, which is fine since Tinkerpop requires it:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html.  Note, not there for Java7.\n\nI do see some mention of the larger memory footprint issue here:  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/member/methodparameterreflection.html.  So that is a consideration.  In this case, with gremlin-core the difference seems to be about 100K when looking at the uncompressed class file size difference.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/185905949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
