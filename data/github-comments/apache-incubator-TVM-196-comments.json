So maybe A1  is easier to complete this task if everyone agree we turn off cache flush when we do single op benchmark?\r\n\r\nI agree we should provide one api for this as if we want to support remote devices (like arm), environment values can not control it on our local machine.

I agree that the cache flush mechanism is useful in getting preciser measurement. It would be great if @FrozenGene can provide some experimental data to further assure.\r\n> \r\n> I vote for folding cache flushing factor into time_evaluator for succinctness. And making it more configurable and generic sounds good to me.\r\n\r\n@yidawang  Previous experimental data is almost based on Ansor, especially x86 winograd. Like winograd of 1x7x7x512x512, the single op tuning performance time could reach in 0.11ms (on one skylake 512 machine), but when to execute on e2e, this op even could cost several ms (sorry I lost this number, only record 0.11ms). The issue is the const matrix and weight (for example, weight 3x3x513x512 will become 6x6x512x512 if tile size is 4).\r\n\r\nAnother benefit to add clflush is we needn't min_repeat_ms (like 1000) because we could measure it very precisely. Like this pr, we even only set repeat to be 10. So we could reduce our tuning time.\r\n\r\nI am collecting auto tvm resnet18 data on one skylake machine and will share it when it completes ASAP.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/650738036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/650790140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5666#issuecomment-650790140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5666","id":650790140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDc5MDE0MA==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-28T16:32:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T16:32:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@dpankratz  sorry for the delayed reply. #5949  relaxes the constraint of the Let to allow a single var to be binded multiple times as long as the binding values are the same.

I think ANTLR only provides those benefits if you assume the people working on the project actually know ANTLR, which in so far as I can tell is not true. Josh and you were pretty much the only ones to work on the previous parser. Not to mention as we extend the parser to TIR and the rest of TVM it will become increasingly hard for anyone to make even small tweaks. \r\n\r\nThe current parser was also incomplete and failed to handle many tricky cases which can often be solved with small amounts of constant lookahead tokens. \r\n\r\nFurthermore many of the grammar gymnastics required to parse in ANTLR are complex and easy for new users to break while this might still require some understanding the ordering is explicit in code for users to read and learn from.\r\n \r\nANTLR is also a painful deployment dependency as we need Java, Python, and C++ to build the current parser. Furthermore the parser necessitated a rewrite given that it was in Python and needs to be in C++ or another statically linkable language. \r\n\r\nFinally error reporting the main reason to write it by hand, if you look at most production quality compilers they have hand written parsers mostly for error reporting and recovery reasons. Most generated parsers fail on the first invalid token, or parse issue such as an invalid identifier. The above parser can continue even after encountering a parse error enabling better error reporting.\r\n\r\nIn my exp. compilers which use parser generators i.e OCaml or F* have a horrible user exp. when compared to languages with hand rolled parsers such as Rust or Lean.
