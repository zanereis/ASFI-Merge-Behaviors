I have updated the patch so that we don't introduce yammer dependency to new producer and new consumer. With the latest patch, server will have 2 additional jmx metrics with name kafka-metrics-total and yammer-metrics-total. New producer and new consumer will  have 1 additional jmx metrics named kafka-metrics-total. Old consumer will have 1 additional metrics named yammer-metrics-total.\n\nI have tested the patch with server, new producer and old consumer. The patch works as expected.

I have two general thoughts about the public APIs of `KafkaConsumer`:\n\n1) in `poll` function, we could first document there are two types of general exceptions: ApiException (only for \"non-retriable\" error codes returned from brokers) and WakeupException. Then we could list all possible ApiExceptions and state that user only need to special handle different types ApiExceptions when necessary. This is just to clear the confusion that we expose all kinds of failures to users.\n\nAlso rep. to the above comment, to simplify the exception list, I would actually prefer only having an `AuthorizationException` and incorporate the authorization error scope (be it topic, group, etc) in the error message. The motivation is that since this exception is considered FATAL and cannot be resolved programmatically even at the app level, users would then not care about the scope in the code but just want to see the error message thrown upon encountering this and have ops resolution then.\n\n2) in `commit` function, incorporate possible exceptions into a single `CommitFailedException` (this can be thrown directly in commitSync, or indirectly from commitAsync's callback) with different error types encoded in the error message. My motivation is the same as above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152851710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/152852214","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/394#issuecomment-152852214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/394","id":152852214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1Mjg1MjIxNA==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-01T19:02:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-01T19:02:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@guozhangwang TopicAuthorizationException and GroupAuthorizationException extend from AuthorizationException, so we can still list just AuthorizationException on the poll() API.

Was (and am still) swamped with the new release.\n\nI have discussed with @ymatsuda several times about adding the customizable partition inside the KStream layer, and here is a brief summary of it:\n1. The cons of relying on the producer's partitioner are that you need to switch on the topic name if different partitioning scheme are needed for different topics; also one may need to switch on all possible topics in her customized partitioner.\n2. The cons of using another partitioner inside KStream along side with Kafka produer's partitioner are that it adds another layer of partitioning on top of it and hence may confuse some users, and also is more vulnerable to resulted different partitioning schemes for shared topics from different processing topics.\n\nAlthough producer's partitioner cannot completely solve the problem of centralizing partitioning schemes cluster-wise, it is actually a good step towards that: people can use a partition registry service just as the data ser-de schema registry service inside a cluster to manage partitioning schemes, while having the KStream partitioner that relying on the K/V types but not the topic names tends to be more tricky to manage hence they can be scattered across multiple processing jobs.\n\nAs for the second point of the cons of a producer's partitioner, users can actually avoid switching on all topics by embedding the default partitioner for the default case as:\n\n```\nif (record.partition() != null) {\n    // ... sanity check and return the partition.\n}\n\nif (topic.equals\"topic1\") {\n    // ... customized partitioning logic 1\n} else if (topic.equals\"topic2\") {\n    // ... customized partitioning logic 1\n} else {\n    return defaultPartitioner.partition(record)\n}\n```\n\nHence be comparing these trade-offs, I feel it would be better in the long term to enforce users to a centralized producer's level partitioner. Please do let me know if you see some scenarios that I did not consider enough here.\n\nAgain, sorry for the late response on this PR.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/153183597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/153186675","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/299#issuecomment-153186675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/299","id":153186675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzE4NjY3NQ==","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-02T23:05:31Z","updated_at":"2015-11-02T23:05:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SinghAsDev An update on the dependency tickets: we are likely to have both 2017 and 2687 merged soon (maybe tonight or tomorrow) by myself and @hachikuji , and we would love to have this ticket rebased / reviewed and merged as soon as possible right after these two are done since our target release date is next week.

I did a little refactoring of the group storage callback to ensure that the state transition to Stable only occurs with a valid assignment.
