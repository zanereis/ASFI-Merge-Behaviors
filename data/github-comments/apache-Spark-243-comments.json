We can remove the magic byte assuming no one's ever going to serialize an RDD of Doubles into 8-byte arrays and then use a Long deser on the 8-byte array.

Python 2.7+ (https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/zipfile.html?highlight=zipfile#zipfile.ZipFile):\n\n``` python\n        with zipfile.ZipFile(path, 'w') as zip:\n            zip.writestr(name,

I will sleep over it and get back. :-) To give a historical perspective, we had a similar split implementations for regression and classification in the beginning that we decided to combine into one. Perhaps, it's the right time to split them again. @etrain was also hinting at that in the multiclass review.\n- I have ensemble RF and Boosting implementations close-to-ready which will need major refactoring or rewriting from scratch considering the magnitude of this PR. That's fine but we should try and get it accepted ASAP. I promise prompt piecemeal reviews.\n- We should perform regression testing and compare with the 1.0 release.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50107957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/50108039","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1582#issuecomment-50108039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1582","id":50108039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMTA4MDM5","user":{"login":"manishamde","id":1067223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjcyMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1067223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde","html_url":"https://github.com/manishamde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manishamde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-25T04:56:25Z","updated_at":"2014-07-25T04:56:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jkbradley You might want to create a JIRA for this one and ask Matei to assign to you.
