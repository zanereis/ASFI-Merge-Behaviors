It is comparatively easy now. \r\n\r\nInitially, I worried about the performance of the `RemovingRecordBatch`'s `setupNewSchema()` while generating different output schema of `ScanBatch` by applying `RuntimeFilter` with an assumption implementation of the `RemovingRecodBatch`'s `setupNewSchema()` to generate dynamic codes.But actually `RemovingRecodBatch`'s `setupNewSchema()` does not generate dynamic codes. So the changed implementation has reduced some complexity to judge whether to output a schema with SV2 or NONE.\r\n\r\nI am not sure I fully understand your proposed strategy , maybe a implementation like adding `RemovingRecodBatch` on a node . But the whole design is to connect the `Scan` node and `HashJoin` one. That changing will make more work to do. So if you have no doubt about the current changed  implementation , let's it go.\r\n\r\nBtw, others you mentioned has been addressed.

I have addressed the comments according to your branch. Btw, I suggest the SV2's `batchActualRecordCount` be renamed as `originalRecordCount`.  The `recordCount` member is the truly final actual record count. Otherwise ,this naming will make others confused. If you agree with it, I will update that.

But I guess it's fine. \r\n`recordCount` is not the actual record count, its the selected number of records. I have also added comments to differentiate between the two variables.\r\n\r\nFew things to resolve:\r\n1) Since I have already shared a commit with generated protobuf files for c++ client. It would be good to take that as well.\r\n2) Please resolve the travis build failure.\r\n3) Meanwhile I ran tests on my shared branch yesterday and there are unit tests failures.

Please take another look. \r\n\r\nThis proved to be a fruitful exercise because using MockRecordBatch exposed some bugs and corner cases in the vectors, and then those bugs and corner cases lead to even more bugs being exposed. The specific issues were:\r\n\r\n - Previously I assumed **copyEntry** was a safe operation (does reallocs when needed), but this was not entirely true. **copyEntry** was safe for non-empty VarLength vectors, and Nullable vectors copying from another Nullable vector. It was not safe for empty VarLength vectors, copying from a non-nullable vector to a nullable vector, or fixed length vectors. So Included fixes for these three corner cases.\r\n - I made **copyEntry** safe for empty VarLength vectors by always making sure the first entry in the offset vector existed and was zero on initialization of the vector. This caused memory to be leaked because some operators created empty VectorContainers and never closed them:\r\n  - TopN created a dummy VectorContainer for no reason and never closed it, so I removed it.\r\n  - HashTableTemplate created a dummy template VectorContainer and never closed it, so I close it now. We should actually probably avoid using the dummy VectorContainer entirely and just use a schema, but I would rather do that in a separate change.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/413355862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/comments/413384904","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/drill/pull/1433#issuecomment-413384904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/drill/issues/1433","id":413384904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzM4NDkwNA==","user":{"login":"sachouche","id":29960235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTYwMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29960235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche","html_url":"https://github.com/sachouche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sachouche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-16T00:43:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T00:43:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"-
