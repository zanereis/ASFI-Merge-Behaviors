Unfortunately, I think this is going to be pretty verbose... it probably makes a lot of sense to insert a new package into the framework code and put things under `org.apache.nifi.framework` but that would touch hundreds if not thousands of classes, so it's probably better to do that in the next major release.\r\n\r\nI think there are a few loggers included here that should go to app-log instead of framework-log (calcite for example). And some loggers should be in `nifi-user` rather than framework or app. And we really only need to update the main `logback.xml` in `nifi-resources`, not all of the toolkit ones. Let me put together another commit that moves a couple of the loggers around and we'll see where that gets us.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/533581079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/533599387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3700#issuecomment-533599387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3700","id":533599387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzU5OTM4Nw==","user":{"login":"patricker","id":1015990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1015990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker","html_url":"https://github.com/patricker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T15:25:28Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T15:25:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@VinceCastro I'd leave the choice to keep it as a single PR, or split it, up to your comfort level with the back-end code.  This is your first contribution, have you looked at the back-end layer?\r\n\r\nA few file pointers in case you want to look into this:\r\n - The main end point is in nifi-web-api/org.apache.nifi.web.api.FlowFileQueueResource\r\n - Do a quick search for `@Path(\"{id}/drop-requests\")` and you'll find the end point.\r\n\r\nThis is a POST for a single Queue.  The ID of the queue goes in the URL.  You might be able to replace this with the ID of a process group and then do a lookup, but probably easier to create a new end point for `@Path(\"{id}/process-group-drop-requests`.\r\n\r\nBut what about submitting multiple queues async?  I think you would need another endpoint there too, and have the body of the post contain some JSON describing the list.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the `DropRequestDTO` does not specify which Queue it's for, so you wouldn't need to worry about that part too much.  The harder part is probably the actual drop logic in NiFi, and updating the other internal objects like `StandardNiFiServiceFacade.createFlowFileDropRequest`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/533599387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/533657698","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3715#issuecomment-533657698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3715","id":533657698,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzY1NzY5OA==","user":{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T18:12:48Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T18:12:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @thenatog all looks good to me.

Quick follow-up.  Instead of adding a new property or filter mode for ignoring the authority and scheme, a simple solution might be to evaluate the regex against the path with *and* without the authority and scheme.  If either match, the result will be included.  Existing flows will continue to work, and future configurations will not need to include an authority and/or scheme in the filter regex.  If you agree, I'll update the PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/536859083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/537048339","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3677#issuecomment-537048339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3677","id":537048339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzA0ODMzOQ==","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T13:56:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T13:56:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks good, going to merge, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/537048339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/537059060","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3772#issuecomment-537059060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3772","id":537059060,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNzA1OTA2MA==","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T14:20:03Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T14:20:03Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@joewitt any feedback?
