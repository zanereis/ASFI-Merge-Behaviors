We don't have a UI test framework, so that shouldn't be a requirement -- though we do need someone to take ownership of that need in the future. Regarding the \"hide from normal users\", the entire app is flask-admin. My understanding is that we can enable authentication, but not authorization, because everything is behind the admin URI. So, you should be able to add the @login_required decorator and test with an authentication backend (e.g. ldap). I haven't set that up since Airbnb and Agari both authenticate at an apache reverse proxy, not in Airflow. \n\nTry sending an email to the dev list to help test your feature for this use case and also ask for help is setting up an auth backend to ensure only authenticated users can see it. \n\nFor any contributor to test, they just need to run `dev/airflowpr work_local`. This will set up your PR to test and it's a snap. \n\ncc/ @bolkedebruin \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/251973880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/252053997","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1828#issuecomment-252053997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1828","id":252053997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjA1Mzk5Nw==","user":{"login":"msumit","id":2018407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTg0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2018407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit","html_url":"https://github.com/msumit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msumit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-06T18:48:06Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T18:48:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@danielvdende plz include jira id in commit msg i.e. `[AIRFLOW-XXX] Commit message`.. making sure that whole msg doesn't cross more than 50 chars..
