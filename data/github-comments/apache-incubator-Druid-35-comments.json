That's what you get when you do a toURI on a File in Java, so I think it makes sense that it should work in Hadoop. It also appears to also be OK by [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) in that \"file:/blah\" is a uri with scheme \"file\", no authority, and path \"/blah\". \"file:///blah\" is the same thing with an empty string authority instead of no authority, which should get interpreted the same way. At least in my reading of the thing.\n\n```\n      URI         = scheme \":\" hier-part [ \"?\" query ] [ \"#\" fragment ]\n\n      hier-part   = \"//\" authority path-abempty\n                  / path-absolute\n                  / path-rootless\n                  / path-empty\n\n      path          = path-abempty    ; begins with \"/\" or is empty\n                    / path-absolute   ; begins with \"/\" but not \"//\"\n                    / path-noscheme   ; begins with a non-colon segment\n                    / path-rootless   ; begins with a segment\n                    / path-empty      ; zero characters\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n   If the URI scheme defines a default for host, then that default\n   applies when the host subcomponent is undefined or when the\n   registered name is empty (zero length).  For example, the \"file\" URI\n   scheme is defined so that no authority, an empty host, and\n   \"localhost\" all mean the end-user's machine, whereas the \"http\"\n   scheme considers a missing authority or empty host invalid.\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/142317796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/142320974","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1761#issuecomment-142320974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1761","id":142320974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjMyMDk3NA==","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-22T15:17:08Z","updated_at":"2015-09-22T15:17:08Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM\nok

How does it relate to IRC as far as our intended use?\n2. Are both intended to be used (please no)?\n3. If we only keep one, is Gitter the choice?\n4. Gitter needs access to private github repositories. This is a problem for some organizations (and something I personally really don't want to give out to a service). Can connectivity with Gitter be accomplished without having people give up access to their private repositories?\n5.

The way it was intended, it should only be throwing QueryInterruptedException if the query was cancelled, it timed out, or the thread was interrupted, in which case the current expectation is that we return `{ \"error\": \"Query cancelled\" }` or `{ \"error\": \"Query timeout\" }` or `{ \"error\": \"Query interrupted\" }` respectively.\n\nAny other errors should not be bubbled back up as QueryInterruptedException, but maybe that was inadvertently changed.\n\nI'm happy to change it in a non-backwards compatible way for 0.9 to have better error reporting / behavior overall, @cheddar's suggestion seems fine, I'd add a couple more though\n\n`HTTP 500`\n\n```\n{\n    # we can add more things here that we want to be explicit about,\n    # use \"exception\" for anything else \n

have been thinking letting Coordinator find unbalanced segment sections and submit HadoopReindexTask for those unbalanced sections.\n\nBasically, we can create a runnable that Coordinator periodically executes. \n\nAt start of this runnable, for each dataSource, Coordinator will build a timeline of segments,\nthen for each segment's shards, we tag it by either S or O\n\nS: the size of shard is below optimal size\nO: the size of shard >= optimal size\n\nOptimal size should be configured externally, we could probably just reuse Coordinator's \"mergeBytesLimit\".\n\nHere is a timeline of segments for a specific dataSource (Note: The segment granularity for each segment could be arbitrary)\n\n```\nSegID:    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12   13\nShard0: |_O_|_O_|_O_|_O_|_S_|_S_|_S_|_O_|_S_|_O_|_S_|_O_|_S_|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|\nShard1:         |_S_|                   |_S_|   |_S_|_S_|\nShard2:         |_S_|                   |_S_|   |_S_|\n```\n\nCoordinator will periodically scan this timeline, and submit HadoopReindexTask for unbalanced sections. The end result we want to achieve is that there are no shards in the timeline that are tagged by S.\n\nHere is a relatively concrete algorithm that Coordinator could use for this runnable, \n\n```\ncurrTotalSize = 0\ncurrInterval = null\nshouldMergeNow = false\n\nfor each segment\n  if currInterval == null\n    currInterval = segment.getInterval()\n  else \n    currInterval = currInterval.withEnd(segment.getEnd())\n  for each shard of current segment\n    if shard.getSize() < optimal size\n      shouldMergeNow = true\n    currTotalSize += shard.getSize()\n\n  if currTotalSize >= optimal size \n    if shouldMergeNow \n      // Note: I still need to think of a routine that determines the segment granularity for \n      // HadoopReindexTask so that the segments generated by it have evenly distributed sizes.\n      submitHadoopReindexTask(dataSource, currInterval) \n\n    // at this point, we are certain segments in currInterval are balanced\n    currTotalSize = 0\n    currInterval = null\n    shouldMergeNow = false\n  else {\n    // do nothing. since the current segment doesn't have enough total size to make a segment \n    // with size >= optimal size, we'll seek to merge it with the next segment in the timeline\n  }\n\nif currInterval != null (this check is same as if currTotalSize > 0)\n  // To discuss: if the last chunk doesn't have enough size, what should we do about it?\n  // Some options, \n  // 1. We don't do anything with it, simply wait for new segments coming in, and the \n  // next Coordinator's run will do the right thing.\n  // 2. Find a way to merge it with a previous optimal segment\n  // 3. ?\n```\n\nBasically, the algorithm iterates each segment in the timeline, and for each shard in that segment, we check if its size is below optimal size, if yes, we should definitely try to merge that shard with others. However, it's possible that the total size of shards in that segment is not big enough to make an optimal size segment, so we should seek to merge the current segment with the next one in the timeline. \n\nThis algorithm should handle the cases below, \n\nCase 1:\nSegment 3 has three shards, two of which have sub-optimal sizes. In this case, we should reindex the interval that segment 3 covers, such that all its shards have optimal size.\n\nCase 2:\nSegments 5, 6, 7 are all small, so we continue iterating until we find Segment 8, now the current total size is >= optimal size, we can submit a reindex task that cover 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nCase 3:\nSimilar to Case 2, Segment 9 has three shards, but the total size of its shards are still less than optimal size, so merge it with Segment 10.\n\nCase 5: The total size of all the segments in the history are not big enough, there is nothing we can do in this case, we just have to wait for new segments coming in such that we have enough size.\n\nCase 6: Segment 13 is left over, should we merge it with previous segment or wait for new segments coming in?\n\nCase 7: ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/144519641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/144589321","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1786#issuecomment-144589321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1786","id":144589321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDU4OTMyMQ==","user":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T01:19:41Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T01:19:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/144589321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/144599757","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/1781#issuecomment-144599757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1781","id":144599757,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDU5OTc1Nw==","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T02:27:39Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T02:27:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":+1: looks good to me, would appreciate a second set of eyes\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/144599757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
