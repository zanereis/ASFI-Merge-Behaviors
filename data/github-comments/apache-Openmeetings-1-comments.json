Addressing, the two issues you mentioned:\n\n1) I did mention this previously. Though, could you specify which other library other than caldav4j is in SNAPSHOT stages?\nI have actually tested it up, cleared most of the tests. I could talk with the dev and resolve the issue. Probably, getting a stable version out.\n2) Http Client 3 unfortunately will have to be used because right now, Apache Jackrabbit, which CalDAV4j uses, still uses HTTP Client 3, and this is a work in progress. If they upgrade it, I'll be able to then migrate all of the code to HTTP Client 4. Here's Jackrabbit Issue JCR 2406: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-2406\n\nNote: Jackrabbit - WebDAV, seems to be the recommended library for WebDAV, from Apache, which I mentioned during the
