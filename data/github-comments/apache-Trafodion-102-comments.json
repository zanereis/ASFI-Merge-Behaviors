It's good that the RAND() function behaves ok for simple cases, but I think it will not behave that way for some other cases. Here is one example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table tr(a int not null primary key, b int);\r\ninsert into tr values\r\n(0,0),\r\n( 200000000,  200000000),\r\n( 400000000,  400000000),\r\n( 600000000,  600000000),\r\n( 800000000,  800000000),\r\n(1000000000, 1000000000),\r\n(1200000000, 1200000000),\r\n(1400000000, 1400000000),\r\n(1600000000, 1600000000),\r\n(1800000000, 1800000000),\r\n(2000000000, 2000000000),\r\n(2147483647, 2147483647);\r\n\r\nset statistics on;\r\nselect * from tr where a > rand();\r\nselect * from tr where b > rand();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I execute this, I see that the first query uses the predicate as a key predicate, evaluating it only once. The second query uses the predicate as an executor predicate, evaluating it for every row.

current change may be functionally good.  JIRA mentioned something like \"query performance will degrade\".\r\n\r\nIf the query in the JIRA refers to the user query, then repository writing is in a different thread and context that of the user query. Hence, it is not in the user query execution path.  \r\n\r\nIf the query performance refers to the repository queries, I am not sure batching the query to execdirect at once may not improve the sub-micro second execution of the insert statement.. It might  turn it out to be a drag to add the individual SQL string into a vector and process it one by one. There is no process hop other than writing the data to hbase.\r\n\r\nEach SQL statement converts the numeric data into a string to form the SQL string at the repository thread and the SQL engine would reverse it to numeric data to be pushed to hbase layer.   Rowset concept could avoid these conversions.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you could demonstrate the stated goal in the JIRA,, please go ahead and merge this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/384747244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/384750241","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1537#issuecomment-384750241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1537","id":384750241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDc1MDI0MQ==","user":{"login":"venkat1m","id":12087142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg3MTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12087142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m","html_url":"https://github.com/venkat1m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkat1m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T18:46:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T18:46:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If a mxosrvr aborts, we would the entire cache, not just the last query stats.

@CoderSong2015 for sharing your test results. It is really incomprehensible to figure out where the improvement in performance came from especially when the data is not batched up and sent to HBase.  Anyway the results are encouraging.  \r\n\r\nIt looks like you have enabled the statistics for the sub-second queries  to be written to the repository.  It looks like insert statement took less than 3 mins for 10,000 user queries while it took 11 mins in the best case to write the statistics for these queries.   So, in a real environment where the system is loaded without a breather you could end up with lot of catch up to do in the thread where repository statistics are written.  Also, you would need a very large cluster for statistics collection alone. Hence the earlier design had a concept of session statistics which captured just enough information representing the work done in the session. I am assuming that at least these session level statistics are written to repository without caching to avoid the catch-up in the repository thread.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you can repeat the testing again, please issue the command \"GET PROCESS STATISTICS FOR <nid>, <pid>\" at a regular intervals during the test from trafci or sqlci. The nid and pid are the logical node id and pid of the mxosrvr used for connection during your testing.\r\n\r\nThe output from this command would help us to figure out if anything else is getting queued up in the user query thread.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/385014655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/385136794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1532#issuecomment-385136794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1532","id":385136794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTEzNjc5NA==","user":{"login":"moscowgentalman","id":12948514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ4NTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12948514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman","html_url":"https://github.com/moscowgentalman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moscowgentalman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-28T03:34:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T03:34:31Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It turns out permission denied. \r\nI have to go through the coprocessor I think. \r\nWill rework.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/385136794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/385143750","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/1537#issuecomment-385143750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/1537","id":385143750,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTE0Mzc1MA==","user":{"login":"CoderSong2015","id":11908595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015","html_url":"https://github.com/CoderSong2015","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderSong2015/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-28T06:02:16Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T06:02:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@selvaganesang I have written an email to trafodion community and gotten the answer why there is improvement in performance.
