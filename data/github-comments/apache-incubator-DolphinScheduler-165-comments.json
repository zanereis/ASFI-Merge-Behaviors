execute Yarn tasks on cluster B via SSH (two Yarns are deployed in cluster AB, and an example of ssh command: ssh user@host \"command\" ), dolphin will monitor application_id, but this application_id is in A It is not found on the cluster (because it is on the B cluster Yarn), which causes some tasks to display task errors, which actually complete normally.\n\n### Anything else\n\n_No
