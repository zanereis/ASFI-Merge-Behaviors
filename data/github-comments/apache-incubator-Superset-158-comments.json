I changed CELERYD_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER from 1 to 10, it sent email successfully on my machine yesterday, TimeLimitExceeded exception was reproduced rarely after the setting, it seemed there are many options about celery settings about which I have no idea. But I changed the crotab settings, it didn't work, I find the monitor in flower, the email_reports.send task is always 'received', but it doesn't execute, all the email_reports.send tasks are pending.\r\n By the way, if the task took more than 120 seconds to run, cannot we change the time limit settings? \r\n\r\nOur online machine has some problems about installing firefox and geckodriver, though it worked on my machine whichi is Ubuntu, I find some details about the incompatibility between firefox and geckodriver, it seemed that you just install the latest version on CentOS, sadly I will try more. Would you please tell  me the verison of  your firefox, selenium and geckodriver. Our system is CentOS 6.x, the latest version cannot work in CentOS 6.x, some librarys of the system are lower version, after upgrading them, it made more system mistakes, I'd like to deploy it on CentOS 7.x,
